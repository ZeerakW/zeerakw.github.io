(1912 – 2001) was a mathematician who was a Ph.D. student of Richard Brauer and wrote many influential papers in the early history of modular representation theory. He taught actuarial mathematics at the University of Michigan from 1938 to 1980. Nesbitt was born in Ontario, Canada. He received his mathematical education at the University of Toronto and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He served the Society of Actuaries from 1985 to 1987 as Vice-President for Research and Studies. He developed the Schuette-Nesbitt formula with Donald R.
