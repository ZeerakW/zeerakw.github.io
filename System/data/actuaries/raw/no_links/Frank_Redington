Frank Mitchell Redington (10 May 1906 – 23 May 1984) was a noted British actuary. Frank Redington was best known for his development of Immunisation Theory  which specifies how a fixed income portfolio can be "immunised" against changing interest rates. He was born in Leeds and attended Liverpool Institute for Boys, and Cambridge University. He joined the staff of the Prudential life insurance company in 1928 and became its Chief Actuary in 1951, continuing in that capacity until his retirement in 1968. He was the Chairman of the Life Offices’ Association from 1956–1957 and president of the Institute of Actuaries 1958–1960. In 2003, he was voted "the greatest British actuary ever" by readers of The Actuary, the magazine for the actuarial profession.   == References == ^ Redington, F. M. (1952).
