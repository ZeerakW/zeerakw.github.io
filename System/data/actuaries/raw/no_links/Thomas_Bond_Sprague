Thomas Bond Sprague (born March 29, 1830, died November 29, 1920) was a British actuary who was the only person to have been President of both the Institute of Actuaries (1882–1886) in London and the Faculty of Actuaries (1894–1896) in Edinburgh, prior to their merger in 2010. Sprague was an undergraduate at St John's College, Cambridge where he was elected to a fellowship following his ranking as Senior Wrangler in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos of 1853. He was awarded the Smith's Prize of Cambridge University in the same year. After serving as the actuary to the Equity and Law life insurance company (1861–1873), he became Chief Executive (1873–1900) of the Scottish Equitable Life Assurance Society in Edinburgh. He retired at age 70. The Thomas Bond Sprague Prize was established in his honour in 2012 within Churchill College, Cambridge and the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge.   == Notes ==
