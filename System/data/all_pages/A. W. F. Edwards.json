He has written several books and numerous scientific papers.  He is best known for his pioneering work, with [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|L.L. Cavalli-Sforza]], on quantitative methods of [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic analysis]], and for strongly advocating Fisher's concept of [[likelihood principle|likelihood]] as the proper basis for [[statistical inference|statistical]] and scientific inference. He has also written extensively on the history of genetics and statistics, including an analysis of whether [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] results were \"too good\", and also on purely mathematical subjects, such as [[Venn diagram]]s.  \n\nIn a 2003 paper,<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Edwards | first1 = A.

Edwards]] (1928&ndash;2007) was also a geneticist and also an FRS; their father, Harold C. Edwards, was a surgeon. He was awarded the Telesio-Galilei Academy Award in 2011 for Biology.\n\nEdwards is also known for his involvement in [[Glider (sailplane)|gliding]], particularly within the [[Cambridge Gliding Centre|Cambridge University Gliding Club]] and for his writing on the subject in ''Sailplane and Gliding'' magazine as \"The Armchair Pilot\".\n\n[[Image:Edwards-Venn-six.svg|thumb|right|6-set Edwards–Venn diagram]]\n\n===Books===\n*Edwards, A.W.F. 1972.
