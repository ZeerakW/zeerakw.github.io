King Oscar II was willing to finance a mathematics prize in 1902, and the mathematicians [[Ludwig Sylow]] and [[Carl Størmer]] drew up statutes and rules for the proposed prize. However, Lie's influence waned after his death, and the dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway in 1905 ended the first attempt to create the Abel Prize.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nAfter interest in the concept of the prize had risen in 2001, a working group was formed to develop a proposal, which was presented to the Prime Minister of Norway in May. In August 2001, the Norwegian government announced that the prize would be awarded beginning in 2002, the two-hundredth [[anniversary]] of Abel's birth. [[Atle Selberg]] received an honorary Abel Prize in 2002, but the first actual Abel Prize was only awarded in 2003.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Selberg|title=Atle Selberg}}</ref><ref name=\"History\"/> A book series presenting Abel Prize laureates and their research was commenced in 2010.
