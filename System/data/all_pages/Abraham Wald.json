His advisor there was [[Karl Menger]].<ref name=Morgenstern1951/>\n\nDespite Wald's brilliance, he could not obtain a university position, because of Austrian discrimination against Jews. However, Oskar Morgenstern created a position for Wald in economics. When the [[Nazism|Nazis]] invaded [[Austria]] in 1938, the discrimination against Jews intensified. In particular, Wald and his family were persecuted as Jews. Wald was able to immigrate to the [[United States]], at the invitation of the [[Cowles Commission for Research in Economics]], to work on econometrics research.<ref name=Morgenstern1951/>\n\nDuring World War II, Wald applied his statistical skills when considering how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire. Researchers from the Center for Naval Analyses had conducted a study of the damage done to aircraft that had returned from missions, and had recommended that armor be added to the areas that showed the most damage. Wald noted that the study only considered the aircraft that had [[Survivorship bias|survived]] their missions—the bombers that had been shot down were not present for the damage assessment. The holes in the returning aircraft, then, represented areas where a bomber could take damage and still return home safely. Wald proposed that the Navy instead reinforce the areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed, since those were the areas that, if hit, would cause the plane to be lost.<ref name=Mangel1984>{{cite journal\n|title=Abraham Wald's work on aircraft survivability\n|last1=Mangel\n|first1=Marc\n|last2=Samaniego\n|first2=Francisco\n|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association\n|date=June 1984\n|volume=79\n|issue=386\n|pages=259–267\n|jstor=2288257\n|doi=10.2307/2288257\n}} [http://people.ucsc.edu/~msmangel/Wald.pdf Reprint on author's web site]</ref><ref name=Wald1943>Wald, Abraham.

Fisher]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]. Fisher attacked Wald for being a mathematician without scientific experience who had written an incompetent book on statistics. Fisher particularly criticized Wald's work on the design of experiments, alleging ignorance of the basic ideas of the subject, as set out by Fisher and [[Frank Yates]].<ref name=Fisher1955>{{cite journal\n|title=Statistical methods and scientific induction\n|authorlink=Ronald A.
