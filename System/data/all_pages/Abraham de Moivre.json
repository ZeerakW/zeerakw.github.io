He was a friend of [[Isaac Newton]], [[Edmond Halley]], and [[James Stirling (mathematician)|James Stirling]]. Even though he faced religious persecution he remained a \"steadfast Christian\" throughout his life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abraham De Moivre|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/De_Moivre.html|website=MacTutor History  of Mathematics Archive}}</ref> Among his fellow [[Huguenot]] exiles in [[England]], he was a colleague of the editor and translator [[Pierre des Maizeaux]].\n\nDe Moivre wrote a book on [[probability theory]], ''[[The Doctrine of Chances]]'', said to have been prized by gamblers. De Moivre first discovered [[Binet's formula]], the [[closed-form expression|closed-form]] expression for [[Fibonacci numbers]] linking the ''n''th power of the [[golden ratio]] ''φ'' to the ''n''th Fibonacci number. He also was the first to postulate the [[Central Limit Theorem]], a cornerstone of probability theory.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Moivre - Doctrine of chances, 1761 - 722666.tif|thumb|''Doctrine of chances'', 1761]]\n\n===Early years===\nAbraham de Moivre was born in Vitry in Champagne on May 26, 1667. His father, Daniel de Moivre, was a surgeon who, though middle class{{so?}} believed in the value of education. Though Abraham de Moivre's parents were Protestant, he first attended Christian Brothers' Catholic school in Vitry, which was unusually tolerant given religious tensions in France at the time. When he was eleven, his parents sent him to the Protestant Academy at [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]], where he spent four years studying [[Greek language|Greek]] under Jacques du Rondel. The Protestant [[Academy of Sedan]] had been founded in 1579 at the initiative of Françoise de Bourbon, the widow of Henri-Robert de la Marck.\n\nIn 1682 the Protestant Academy at Sedan was suppressed, and de Moivre enrolled to study logic at Saumur for two years. Although mathematics was not part of his course work, de Moivre read several works on mathematics on his own including ''Elémens des mathématiques'' by [[Jean Prestet]] and a short treatise on games of chance, ''De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae'', by Christiaan Huygens. In 1684, de Moivre moved to [[Paris]] to study [[physics]], and for the first time had formal mathematics training with private lessons from [[Jacques Ozanam]].\n\nReligious persecution in France became severe when [[King Louis XIV]] issued the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685, which revoked the [[Edict of Nantes]], that had given substantial rights to French Protestants. It forbade Protestant worship and required that all children be baptized by Catholic priests. De Moivre was sent to the Prieure de Saint-Martin, a school that the authorities sent Protestant children to for indoctrination into Catholicism.\n\nIt is unclear when de Moivre left the Prieure de Saint-Martin and moved to England, since the records of the Prieure de Saint-Martin indicate that he left the school in 1688, but de Moivre and his brother presented themselves as Huguenots admitted to the Savoy Church in London on August 28, 1687.\n\n===Middle years===\nBy the time he arrived in London, de Moivre was a competent mathematician with a good knowledge of many of the standard texts. To make a living, de Moivre became a private tutor of [[mathematics]], visiting his pupils or teaching in the coffee houses of London. De Moivre continued his studies of mathematics after visiting the [[Earl of Devonshire]] and seeing Newton's recent book, [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|''Principia Mathematica'']]. Looking through the book, he realized that it was far deeper than the books that he had studied previously, and he became determined to read and understand it. However, as he was required to take extended walks around London to travel between his students, de Moivre had little time for study, so he tore pages from the book and carried them around in his pocket to read between lessons.\n\nAccording to a possibly apocryphal story, Newton, in the later years of his life, used to refer people posing mathematical questions to him to de Moivre, saying, \"He knows all these things better than I do.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=David R. |last=Bellhouse |title=Abraham De Moivre: Setting the Stage for Classical Probability and Its Applications |location=London |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-56881-349-3 |page=99 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1692, de Moivre became friends with [[Edmond Halley]] and soon after with [[Isaac Newton]] himself. In 1695, Halley communicated de Moivre's first mathematics paper, which arose from his study of [[Newton's notation|fluxions]] in the ''Principia Mathematica'', to the [[Royal Society]]. This paper was published in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' that same year. Shortly after publishing this paper, de Moivre also generalized Newton's noteworthy [[binomial theorem]] into the [[multinomial theorem]]. The [[Royal Society]] became apprised of this method in 1697, and it made de Moivre a member two months later.\n\nAfter de Moivre had been accepted, Halley encouraged him to turn his attention to astronomy. In 1705, de Moivre discovered, intuitively, that \"the centripetal force of any planet is directly related to its distance from the centre of the forces and reciprocally related to the product of the diameter of the evolute and the cube of the perpendicular on the tangent.\" In other words, if a planet, M, follows an elliptical orbit around a focus F and has a point P where PM is tangent to the curve and FPM is a right angle so that FP is the perpendicular to the tangent, then the centripetal force at point P is proportional to FM/(R*(FP)<sup>3</sup>) where R is the radius of the curvature at M. The [[mathematician]] [[Johann Bernoulli]] proved this formula in 1710.\n\nDespite these successes, de Moivre was unable to obtain an appointment to a chair of mathematics at any university, which would have released him from his dependence on time-consuming tutoring that burdened him more than it did most other mathematicians of the time. At least a part of the reason was a bias against his French origins.<ref>{{cite book |title=The ascent of mathematics|first1=Raymond F.|last1=Coughlin|first2=David E.|last2=Zitarelli|publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1984 |isbn=0-07-013215-1 |page=437|quote=Unfortunately, because he was not British, De Moivre was never able to obtain a university teaching position}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Cavendish|volume=220|series=Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society|first1=Christa|last1=Jungnickel|first2=Russell|last2=McCormmach|publisher=American Philosophical Society|year=1996|isbn=9780871692207|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiDoN-rg8I8C&pg=PA52|quote=Well connected in mathematical circles and highly regarded for his work, he still could not get a good job.

Arbuthnot, Hill, Halley, Jones, Machin, Burnet, Robarts, Bonet, Aston, and Taylor to review the claims of Newton and Leibniz as to who discovered calculus. The full details of the controversy can be found in the [[Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy]] article.\n\nThroughout his life de Moivre remained poor. It is reported that he was a regular customer of Slaughter's Coffee House, St. Martin's Lane at Cranbourn Street, where he earned a little money from playing chess.\n\n===Later years===\nDe Moivre continued studying the fields of probability and mathematics until his death in 1754 and several additional papers were published after his death. As he grew older, he became increasingly [[lethargic]] and needed longer sleeping hours. He noted that he was sleeping an extra 15 minutes each night and correctly calculated the date of his death as the day when the sleep time reached 24 hours, November 27, 1754.<ref name=\"Cajori-History\">{{cite book|title = History of Mathematics | last1 = Cajori | first1 = Florian | authorlink = Florian Cajori | page = 229 | publisher = [[American Mathematical Society]] | isbn = 9780821821022 | edition = 5 | year = 1991}}</ref> He died in London and his body was buried at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], although his body was later moved.\n\n==Probability==\n{{see also|de Moivre–Laplace theorem}}\nDe Moivre pioneered the development of analytic geometry and the theory of probability by expanding upon the work of his predecessors, particularly Christiaan Huygens and several members of the Bernoulli family. He also produced the second textbook on probability theory, [[The Doctrine of Chances|''The Doctrine of Chances: a method of calculating the probabilities of events in play'']]. (The first book about games of chance, ''Liber de ludo aleae'' (''On Casting the Die''), was written by [[Girolamo Cardano]] in the 1560s, but it was not published until 1663.) This book came out in four editions, 1711 in Latin, and in English in 1718, 1738, and 1756. In the later editions of his book, de Moivre included his unpublished result of 1733, which is the first statement of an approximation to the binomial distribution in terms of what we now call the normal or [[Gaussian function]].<ref>See:\n*  Abraham De Moivre (November 12, 1733) \"Approximatio ad summam terminorum binomii (a+b)<sup>n</sup> in seriem expansi\" (self-published pamphlet), 7 pages.\n*  English translation:  A. De Moivre, ''The Doctrine of Chances'' … , 2nd ed. (London, England:  H. Woodfall, 1738), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PII_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA235#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 235-243].</ref> This was the first method of finding the probability of the occurrence of an error of a given size when that error is expressed in terms of the variability of the distribution as a unit, and the first identification of the calculation of [[probable error]]. In addition, he applied these theories to gambling problems and [[actuarial table]]s.\n\nAn expression commonly found in probability is n! but before the days of calculators calculating n! for a large n was time consuming. In 1733 de Moivre proposed the formula for estimating a factorial as ''n''!&nbsp;=&nbsp;''cn''<sup>''n''+1/2</sup>e<sup>−''n''</sup>. He obtained an approximate expression for the constant ''c'' but it was [[James Stirling (mathematician)|James Stirling]] who found that c was √(2''π'')\n.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pearson|first=Karl|title=Historical note on the origin of the normal curve of errors|journal=Biometrika|volume=16|pages=402–404|postscript=.|doi=10.1093/biomet/16.3-4.402}}</ref> Therefore, [[Stirling's approximation]] is as much due to de Moivre as it is to Stirling.\n\nDe Moivre also published an article called \"Annuities upon Lives\" in which he revealed the normal distribution of the mortality rate over a person’s age. From this he produced a simple formula for approximating the revenue produced by annual payments based on a person’s age. This is similar to the types of formulas used by insurance companies today.\n\n===Priority regarding the Poisson distribution===\nSome results on the [[Poisson distribution]] were first introduced by de Moivre in ''De Mensura Sortis seu; de Probabilitate Eventuum in Ludis a Casu Fortuito Pendentibus'' in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, p.&nbsp;219.<ref name=JKK157>Johnson, N.L., Kotz, S., Kemp, A.W. (1993) ''Univariate Discrete distributions'' (2nd edition). Wiley. ISBN 0-471-54897-9, p157</ref> As a result, some authors have argued that the Poisson distribution should bear the name of de Moivre.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167715282900104 Stigler, Stephen M. \"Poisson on the Poisson distribution.\" Statistics & Probability Letters 1.1 (1982): 33-35.]</ref><ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/1403045?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Hald, Anders, Abraham de Moivre, and Bruce McClintock. \"A. de Moivre:'De Mensura Sortis' or'On the Measurement of Chance'.\" International Statistical Review/Revue Internationale de Statistique (1984): 229-262]</ref>\n\n==De Moivre’s formula==\nIn 1707 de Moivre derived:\n\n: <math> \\cos x = \\tfrac{1}{2} (\\cos(nx) + i\\sin(nx))^{1/n} + \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\cos(nx) - i\\sin(nx))^{1/n}  </math>\n\nwhich he was able to prove for all positive [[integer]]s&nbsp;''n''.<ref>{{citation|title=A Source Book in Mathematics, Volume 3|first=David Eugene|last=Smith|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1959|isbn=9780486646909|page=444|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TSKAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA444}}.</ref> In 1722 he suggested it in the more well known form of [[de Moivre's Formula]]:\n: <math> (\\cos x + i\\sin x)^n = \\cos(nx) + i\\sin(nx). \\, </math>\n\nIn 1749 Euler proved this formula for any real n using [[Euler's formula]], which makes the proof quite straightforward. This formula is important because it relates [[complex numbers]] and [[trigonometry]]. Additionally, this formula allows the derivation of useful expressions for cos(''nx'') and sin(''nx'') in terms of cos(''x'') and sin(''x'').\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* See de Moivre's ''Miscellanea Analytica'' (London: 1730) p 26–42.\n* [[H.
