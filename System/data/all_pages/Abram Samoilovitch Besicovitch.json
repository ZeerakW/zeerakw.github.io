He converted to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], joining the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], on marrying in 1916. He was appointed professor at the [[Perm State University|University of Perm]] in 1917, and was caught up in the [[Russian Civil War]] over the next two years. In 1920 he took a position at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|Petrograd University]].\n\nIn 1924 he went to [[Copenhagen]] and [[Harald Bohr]], on a [[Rockefeller Fellowship]], where he worked on [[almost periodic function]]s, which now bear his name. After a visit to [[G.H. Hardy]] at the [[University of Oxford]], he had appointments at the [[University of Liverpool]] in 1926, and the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1927.\n\nAfter moving to Cambridge in 1927, and by 1950 he had been appointed to the Rouse Ball Chair of Mathematics, which he held until his retirement in 1958, he then toured the USA for eight years before returning to Trinity College Cambridge until probably his death in 1970. He was appointed Lecturer in the Faculty of Mathematics, and therefore received recognition as a Cambridge MA by 'Special Grace' on 24 November 1928. He worked mainly on [[combinatorial methods]] and questions in [[real analysis]], such as the [[Kakeya needle problem]] and the [[Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension]]. These two particular areas have proved increasingly important as the years have gone by.\n\nHe was also a major influence on the economist [[Piero Sraffa]], after 1940, when they were both Fellows of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and on [[Dennis Lindley]], one of the founders of the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] movement in the United Kingdom. He was [[John Edensor Littlewood|J.E. Littlewood's]] successor in 1950 in the [[Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics|Rouse Ball chair]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], retiring in 1958. He died in Cambridge.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n'''''Besicovitch''''' was in 1934 made [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name=\"frs\"/> and in 1952 won the  [[Sylvester Medal]] from the [[Royal Society]].<ref>[http://royalsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=3372 Entry in Archive of the Royal Society].</ref> He received in 1950 the '''''[[De Morgan Medal]]''''' of the [[London Mathematical Society]]. He was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in the fall of 1954.<ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/ Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars]</ref>\n\n'''''Besicovtich''''''s candidacy for the Royal Society reads:{{quote|text=\"'''''Distinguished as a pure mathematician, particularly for his researches in the theory of functions of a real variable, the theory of analytic functions, and the theory of almost periodic functions.
