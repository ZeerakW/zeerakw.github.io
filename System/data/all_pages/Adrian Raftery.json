His research has focused on the development of new statistical methods, particularly for the social, environmental and health sciences. He has been a leader in developing methods for  Bayesian model selection and [[Bayesian model averaging]], and model-based clustering, as well as inference from computer simulation models. He has recently developed new methods for [[probabilistic forecasting#Weather forecasting|probabilistic weather forecasting]] and probabilistic [[population projection]]s.\n\n==Selected publications==\n*Raftery, A.
