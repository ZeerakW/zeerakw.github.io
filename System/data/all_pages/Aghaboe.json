It is located on the [[R434 road|R434]] [[regional road]] in the rural hinterland west of the town of [[Abbeyleix]].\n\nIt contains the ruins of the [[Abbey of Aghaboe]] which was founded by [[St. Canice]] in [[kingdom of Ossory|Ossory]] in the 6th century and, beside it, the [[St. Canice, Aghaboe|Church of Ireland church of St. Canice]]. At some point before the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], Aghaboe Abbey succeeded [[Saighir|Seirkieran]] as the principle episcopal seat in the [[Diocese of Ossory]] and in time, itself came to be succeeded by [[St. Canice's Cathedral]] in [[Kilkenny]] city, founded by the same saint.  Aghaboe is famous as being the first seat of St. [[Vergilius of Salzburg|Feargal]], bishop of Ossory, and who later traveled through [[Francia]] and became bishop of [[Salzburg]], Austria.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of towns and villages in the Republic of Ireland|List of towns and villages in Ireland]]\n\n==References==\n\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aghaboe}}\n[[Category:Towns and villages in County Laois]]\n[[Category:Townlands of County Laois]]\n[[Category:FitzPatrick dynasty]]\n{{Laois-geo-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Aghaboe"}}}}
