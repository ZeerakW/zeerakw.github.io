He is known for his work in [[probability]] theory, [[statistics]] and [[financial mathematics]].\n\nHe graduated from [[Moscow State University]] in 1957. From that time till now he has been working in [[Steklov Mathematical Institute]]. He earned his candidate degree in 1961 ([[Andrey Kolmogorov]] was his advisor) and a doctoral degree in 1967 for his work \"On statistical sequential analysis\". He is a professor of the department of mechanics and mathematics of Moscow State University, since 1971. He was elected a corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1997 and a full member in 2011.  {{As of|2007}} Shiryaev holds a 20% permanent professorial position at the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester]].\n\n==Contributions==\nHis scientific work concerns different aspects of [[probability theory]], [[statistics]] and its applications. He has  contributions to:\n\n*Nonlinear theory of stationary [[stochastic processes]]\n*Problems of fast detection of random effects (A.N. Kolmogorov Prize of Russian Academy of Sciences, 1994)\n*Problems of optimal nonlinear filtration, [[stochastic differential equations]] (A.N. Markov Prize of [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]], 1974)\n*Problems of stochastic optimization, including \"Optimal [[stopping rule]]s\"\n*Problems of general stochastic theory and [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] theory\n*Problems of stochastic finance (monograph \"The Essentials of Stochastic Finance\", English and Russian editions)\n\n==Publications==\n[http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9609 Change of Time and Change of Measure (2nd Edition) - World Scientific Publishing] <ref>http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9609</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{MathGenealogy|id=17541}}\n*[http://mech.math.msu.su/staff/shiriaev.htm A.N.
