He was a [[professor]] at [[Lund University]] and its [[Rector (academia)|rector]] from 1907 to 1909.\n\nHe was born in Malmöhus County, now [[Skåne County]], in southern Sweden and became a student at the nearby [[University of Lund]] in 1861. In 1864 he started to work for the [[observatory]], and received his Ph.D. in 1868 working on methods to obtain the [[latitude]] of a place by astronomical observations. He was awarded the title of [[associate professor]] in Mechanics and [[Mathematical Physics]] in 1878, and elected Fellow of the [[Swedish Academy of Science]] in 1888. In 1897 he became a full professor.\n\nIn 1874 he was awarded a travel grant to study abroad for six months. He went to the universities at [[Leipzig]] and [[Erlangen]] to work with [[Felix Klein]] and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]].\n\nHis most important work was in the field of transformations pioneered by [[Sophus Lie]]. He improved greatly the understanding of contact transformations and introduced a new second class transformation, now known as [[Bäcklund transform|auto-Bäcklund transformation]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bäcklund transform]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~schief/backlund.html Short bio]\n*{{sv icon}} [http://runeberg.org/nfbd/0471.html article Bäcklund] [[Nordisk familjebok]]\n* {{MathGenealogy|id=55346}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Backlund, Albert Victor\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Swedish mathematician and physicist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = January 11, 1845\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Skåne County]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = February 23, 1922\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Lund]], [[Lund Municipality]], [[Skåne County]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Backlund, Albert Victor}}\n[[Category:1845 births]]\n[[Category:1922 deaths]]\n[[Category:Differential geometers]]\n[[Category:Swedish mathematicians]]\n[[Category:People connected to Lund University]]\n[[Category:19th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Swedish physicists]]\n[[Category:Lund University alumni]]\n[[Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]\n\n\n{{sweden-scientist-stub}}\n{{Sweden-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Albert Victor Bäcklund"}}}}
