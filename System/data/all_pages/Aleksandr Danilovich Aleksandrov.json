His advisors there were [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Fock|Vladimir Fock]], a physicist, and [[Boris Delaunay]], a mathematician. In&nbsp;1933 Aleksandrov worked at the [[State Optical Institute]]&nbsp;(GOI) and at the same time gave [[lecture]]s at the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of the University. He completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]&nbsp;in&nbsp;1935 at the University and later in&nbsp;1937 &mdash; a [[D.Sc.]]&nbsp;[[dissertation]]. He became a [[professor]] at the University, while also working at [[LOMI]], the Leningrad Department of the [[Steklov Mathematical Institute]] (now PDMI, [[St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences|Petersburg Department of the Mathematical Institute]]). In 1951 he became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. Appointed the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university in&nbsp;1952, Aleksandrov remained in this position until&nbsp;1964. In&nbsp;1946 he became a corresponding member, and in&nbsp;1964 &mdash; a [[academician|full member]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]]. Since&nbsp;1975 he was also a member of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]].\n\nAleksandr Aleksandrov should not be confused with [[Pavel Alexandrov]], another mathematician at the Steklov Institute.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1986 Aleksandrov lived in [[Novosibirsk]], heading the Laboratory of [[Geometry]] of the Institute of Mathematics of the [[Siberia]]n Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences, teaching at  [[Novosibirsk State University]]. In&nbsp;1986 he returned to Leningrad (now [[Saint Petersburg]]) to head the geometry laboratory at LOMI.\n\n== Awards ==\nPartial list of the awards, [[medal]]s, and prizes of Aleksandrov:\n* [[Stalin Prize]] (1942)\n* [[Lobachevsky Medal|Lobachevsky International Prize]] (1951)\n* [[Euler Gold Medal]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (1992)\nOne of many [[Order (decoration)|order]]s that he was awarded was given to him in&nbsp;1990 for his opposition to [[Lysenkoism]], which deviated from standard theories of genetics; it was embraced during Stalin's rule but later considered a pseudoscience.\n\n== Works by Aleksandrov ==\nAleksandrov wrote a multitude of books, scientific papers, [[textbook]]s for various levels (schools to universities). He also wrote non-mathematical papers, [[memoir]]s about famous scientists, and philosophical [[essay]]s dealing with the moral values of science.\n\nA full bibliography is available in&nbsp;[[#References|<nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]].

Several of them became his co-authors: V.&nbsp;Berestovskii, A.&nbsp;Verner,  N.&nbsp;Netsvetaev, I.&nbsp;Nikolaev, and V.&nbsp;Ryzhik.\n\nHis last Ph.D. student was [[Grigori Perelman]] who proved [[Thurston's geometrization conjecture]]  in 2002/2003 \nwhich contains the [[Poincaré conjecture]] as a special case.\n\n==Mountaineering==\nAleksandrov became attracted to alpinism under the influence of his advisor [[Boris Delaunay]]. In the summer of&nbsp;1937, after defending his D.Sc.,\n:''…together with I.&nbsp;Chashnikov he makes a first climb to the Chotchi summit, and with K.&nbsp;Piskaryov performs a climb of Bu-Ul'gen via the western wall (one of the first wall climbs in the history of the Soviet alpinism).<br><nowiki>[…]</nowiki> In&nbsp;1940&nbsp; he participates in a record-making traversal<nowiki>[…]</nowiki> He manages, almost by a miracle, to stop the fall of&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Gromov, who had fallen along with a snow shelf. It was with this traversal that Aleksandrov completed the alpinist sports master requirements. The German-Soviet War postponed awarding him this honorary title until&nbsp;1949.''\n:: (See ''A.D.&nbsp;Aleksandrov in the mountains (an alpinist biography)'', Savvon&nbsp;S.M., [[#References|<nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]], p.182&ndash;183)\n\nDuring his rectorship, Aleksandrov also advanced the mountaineering sport activities in the university, actively participating in the climbs.\n\nThe fiftieth birthday was celebrated by Aleksandrov in the mountains with his friends. On that day he made a solo first climb of an\n: ''…unnamed peak 6222&nbsp;m (Shakhdarinsk ridge, [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]]), that as he suggested was then named \"The peak of the Leningrad university.\"\n\nDuring later years Aleksandrov didn't undertake climbs due to health problems, yet he never ceased dreaming of climbs. Finally, in 1982, the year of his seventieth birthday, he, together with K.&nbsp;Tolstov, performs in [[Tian Shan]] his last climb, of the [[Panfilov Peak]]…''\n:: (same source)\n\n==See also==\n* [[CAT(k) space|CAT(''k'') space]]\n* [[Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy's theorem]]\n* [[Alexandrov theorem]]\n* [[Aleksandrov–Rassias problem]]\n* [[Alexandrov&ndash;Fenchel inequality]]\n* [[Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n# ''Академик Александр Данилович Александров.
