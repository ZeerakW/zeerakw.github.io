While studying at [[Moscow State University]], he became one of the first followers of the famous [[Nikolai Luzin|Luzin]] school. Khinchin graduated from the university in 1916 and six years later he became a full professor there, retaining that position until his death.\n\nKhinchin's early works focused on [[real analysis]]. Later he applied methods from the metric theory of functions to problems in probability theory and [[number theory]]. He became one of the founders of modern probability theory, discovering the [[law of the iterated logarithm]] in 1924, achieving important results in the field of [[Central limit theorem|limit theorems]], giving a definition of a [[stationary process]] and laying a foundation for the theory of such processes.\n\nKhinchin made significant contributions to the metric theory of [[Diophantine approximation]]s and established an important result for simple real [[continued fraction]]s, discovering a property of such numbers that leads to what is now known as [[Khinchin's constant]]. He also published several important works on [[statistical physics]], where he used the methods of probability theory, and on [[information theory]], [[queuing theory]] and [[mathematical analysis]].\n\nIn 1939 Khinchin was elected as a Correspondent Member of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]]. He was awarded the [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prize]] (1941), the [[Order of Lenin]], three other orders, and medals.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pollaczek–Khinchine formula]]\n*[[Wiener–Khinchin theorem]]\n*[[Khinchin inequality]]\n*[[Equidistribution theorem]]\n*[[Khinchin's constant]]\n*[[Khinchin–Lévy constant]]\n*[[Khinchin's theorem on Diophantine approximations]]\n*[[Law of the iterated logarithm]]\n*[[Palm-Khintchine theorem|Palm-Khintchine Theorem]]\n*Lévy–Khintchin formula of characteristic function of [[Lévy process]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Sur la Loi des Grandes Nombres'', in ''Comptes Rendus de l'Academie des Sciences'', Paris, 1929\n*''Asymptotische Gesetze der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung'', Berlin: Julius Springer, 1933<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rietz, H.
