C. Aitken (1935). \"On Least Squares and Linear Combinations of Observations\", ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', 55, 42–48.</ref> Another influential paper co-authored with his student [[Harold Silverstone]] established the lower bound on the variance of an [[estimator]],<ref>A. C. Aitken and H. Silverstone (1942). \"On the Estimation of Statistical Parameters\", ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', 1942, 61, 186–194.</ref> now known as [[Cramér–Rao bound]].\n\n==Life and work==\nAitken was born on 1 April 1895 in [[Dunedin]], the eldest of the 7 children of William Aitken and Elizabeth Towers. Nevertheless he was of Scottish descent, his grandfather having emigrated from the Borders in 1868. He was educated at [[Otago Boys' High School]] in Dunedin (1908–13) and won the Thomas Baker Calculus Scholarship in his last year at school. He saw active service during World War I with the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]], at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], in Egypt, and at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. He was wounded at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]].<ref>A. C. Aitken (1963). ''Gallipoli to the Somme: Recollections of a New Zealand infantryman''. Oxford.</ref>\n\nAitken graduated wit an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree from the [[University of Otago]] in 1920, then worked as a schoolmaster at Otago Boys' High School from 1920–3.\n\nAitken studied for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree at the [[University of Edinburgh]], in Scotland, where his dissertation, \"Smoothing of Data\", was considered so impressive that he was awarded a [[Doctor of Science|Sc.D.]] degree in 1926.<ref name=\"edge\" /> Aitken's impact at the University had been so great that he had been elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (FRSE) the year before the award of his degree, upon the proposal of [[Sir Edmund Whittaker]], [[Sir Charles Galton Darwin]], [[Edward Copson]] and David Gibb. Aitken was awarded the Makdougall-Brisbane Prize for 1930-2, and was very active in the affairs of the RSE, serving as Councillor (1934–36), Secretary to Ordinary Meetings (1936–40), and Vice-President (1948–51; 1956-9). He was also an active member of the [[Edinburgh Mathematical Society]] and a Fellow of the [[Faculty of Actuaries]].\n\nAitken spent his entire career at Edinburgh University, working as Lecturer in Actuarial Mathematics & Statistics (1925–36), Reader in Statistics (1936–46), and finally Professor of Mathematics (1946–65).\n\nDuring World War II he worked in [[Hut 6]] [[Bletchley Park]] decrypting [[ENIGMA]] code.<ref name=\"odbn\">{{Cite journal| title = Aitken, Alexander Craig | journal = The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/30357 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>\n\nAitken was one of the best [[mental calculator]]s known, and had a prodigious memory.<ref name=\"edge\" /> He knew the first 1000 digits of <math>\\pi</math>, the 96 recurring digits of 1/97, and memorised the ''[[Aeneid]]'' in high school. Unfortunately, his inability to forget the horrors he witnessed in [[World War I]] led to recurrent [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] throughout his life.\n\nAitken was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS) in 1936<ref name=\"frs\"/> and an [[Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand|Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand]] (Hon FRSNZ) in 1940,<ref>[http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/publications/reports/yearbooks/year2000/past-honorary-fellows/ Honorary Fellows, 1870-2000] - website of the Royal Society of New Zealand</ref> both for his work in statistics, [[algebra]] and [[numerical analysis]]. He was an accomplished writer, being elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature]] (FRSL) in 1964 in response to the publication of his war memoirs. He was also an excellent musician, being described by [[Eric Fenby]] as the most accomplished amateur musician he had ever known, and was a champion athlete in his younger days.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n\nAn annual \"Aitken Prize\" is awarded by the [[New Zealand Mathematical Society]] for the best student talk at their colloquium. The prize was inaugurated in 1995 at the [[University of Otago]]'s Aitken Centenary Conference, a joint mathematics and statistics conference held to remember Aitken a hundred years after his birth.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe married a lecturer in Biology at Otago University, and they had a son and a daughter. Aitken died on 3 November 1967, in [[Edinburgh]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n*I. M. L.
