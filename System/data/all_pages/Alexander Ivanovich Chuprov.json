Alexander attended the Law Department of the [[Moscow University]] where he became interested in [[Wilhelm Roscher]]'s research. He founded the Moscow Society to Disseminate Technical Knowledge in 1869 and was elected into the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1887.\n\nChuprov has been described as the founder of [[transport economics]] and the multiple-factor analysis of economic regions.<ref>[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/sie/20128/%D0%A7%D0%A3%D0%9F%D0%A0%D0%9E%D0%92 Soviet Historical Encyclopaedia]</ref> In his landmark work ''The Railway Economy'' (1875–78) he analyzed statistics on railway traffic. He distinguished one region from another according to \"the value of the market, the cost of transportation, and demographic indicators\".<ref>Quoted from: ''Russian Empire: Space, People, Power, 1700–1930''. Indiana University Press, 2007. Page 132.</ref>\n\nChuprov became known as \"the heart and soul\" of [[zemstvo]] stastistical investigations and [[sample survey]]s in the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>Esther Kingston-Mann.

Page 129.</ref> His researchers are said to have interviewed 4.5 million Russian [[muzhik]]s. Their mission was to provide a modern statistical description of the Russian peasant commune, or [[obschina]]. Chuprov viewed the Russian obshchina as a valuable social institution which should be preserved.\n\nChuprov was a lifelong friend of another prominent statistician, [[Ivan Yanzhul]]. His son [[Alexander Alexandrovich Chuprov|Alexander A. Chuprov]] (1874–1926) is said to have given \"much impetus to statistics in pre-revolutionary Russia\".<ref>E. Seneta.
