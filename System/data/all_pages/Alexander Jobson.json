He was educated in the public system and at the age of 14 he started working as a junior clerk with the [[Australian Mutual Provident Society]] (AMP) in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]]. He studied [[accountancy]] and qualified as an Associate of the [[Institute of Actuaries]] and a Fellow of the Australian Corporation of Public Accountants. Jobson moved to [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]] in 1902 and became [[actuary]] for an American firm. He established his own business as an accountant and actuary in 1906. From 1910 to 1916, he also wrote a financial column in the [[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Sun]].\n\nJobson enlisted in the Scottish Rifles in August 1898 and was commissioned as a full lieutenant on 2 December 1899. He was promoted to captain on 29 August 1902. After moving to Sydney he joined the New South Wales Scottish Rifles with the rank of lieutenant on 1 January 1903 and was promoted to captain again on 1 July. He was promoted major on 13 September 1909. He transferred to the 25th Infantry on 1 July 1912 and on 1 July 1913 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel; and appointed to command the 34th Infantry Regiment.\n\n==World War I==\nJobson was appointed to the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] on 10 February 1916 with the rank of colonel and given command of the 9th Infantry Brigade. He was promoted to temporary brigadier general on 1 May 1916, shortly before departing Sydney. He arrived in London via [[South Africa]] and [[Dakar]] on 11 July 1916. The brigade trained on [[Salisbury Plain]] before moving to France in November. The brigade entered the an area of the line known as \"Nursery Sector\" at [[Armentières]] on 26 November 1916.\n\nTwice, during the absence of Major General [[John Monash|Monash]] in 1917, Jobson became acting commander of the [[Australian 3rd Division (World War I)|3rd Division]]. His brigade was involved in a number of raids and Jobson was [[mentioned in dispatches]] for his part. At the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] in June 1917, Jobson's planning and performance was excellent, but afterwards Jobson seemed badly affected by the stress of the situation. At a conference on 24 July 1917, Jobson appeared to be in an agitated state and Monash felt that his friend was becoming unstable.\n\nJobson relinquished command on 25 August 1917 and returned to Australia where his appointment with the AIF was terminated on 9 December. Monash arranged for him to be again mentioned in dispatches and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in the 1918 New Year's List.\n\n==Post war==\nIn October 1918, Jobson was appointed to command the 2nd Battalion, 53rd Infantry Regiment with the rank of lieutenant colonel and honorary brigadier general. Failure in the field was apparently considered no bar to promotion and he was promoted to colonel in December 1919 and transferred to the Reserve of Officers in 1921.\n\nAfter the war, Jobson held a number of company directorates, most notably director of [[AMP Limited|AMP]] in 1925 and Vice Chairman in 1932.\n\nJobson collapsed and died from a [[coronary occlusion]] in [[King Street, Sydney]] on 7 November 1933 and was cremated.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Australian Generals]]\n\n==References==\n* Ross Mallett, [http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/~rmallett/Generals/index.html Alexander Jobson], ''General Officers of the First AIF'', adfa.edu.au\n* Colin Forster, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090482b.htm 'Jobson, Alexander (1875–1933)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', Volume 9, Melbourne University Press, 1983, pp 488–489.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Jobson, Alexander\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Australian general\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 2 April 1875\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Clunes, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 7 November 1933\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Sydney, New South Wales]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jobson, Alexander}}\n[[Category:1875 births]]\n[[Category:1933 deaths]]\n[[Category:Australian generals]]\n[[Category:Australian military personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order]]\n[[Category:Actuaries]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Alexander Jobson"}}}}
