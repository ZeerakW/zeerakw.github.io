There he met and married Mary Erskine of Alva, for whom he wrote:\n\n:When I see thee, I love thee, but hearing adore,\n:I wonder, and think you a woman no more;\n:Till, mad with admiring, I cannot contain,\n:And, kissing those lips, find you woman again.\n\nThey had several children. Mary, whose sister Euphemia was the mother of [[James Boswell]], died of fever in 1766.\n\nHe propounded a scheme in 1742 for providing pensions for the widows of ministers. The tables which he drew up from information obtained from all the presbyteries of Scotland were based on a system of [[actuarial science|actuarial calculation]] that supplied a precedent followed by insurance companies in modern times for reckoning averages of longevity.\n\nWebster published in 1748 his ''Calculations'', setting forth the principles on which his scheme for widows' pensions was based; he also wrote a defence of the [[Methodist]] movement in 1742, and ''Zeal for the Civil and Religious Interests of Mankind Commended'' (1754).\n\nIn 1755 the government commissioned Webster to obtain data for the first [[census]] of Scotland, which he carried out in the same year. In 1753 he was elected [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|moderator of the General Assembly]]; in 1771 he was appointed a dean of the [[Chapel Royal]] and [[chaplain]] to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in Scotland.\n\nSocially, despite his 'High Flying' Evangelical position in the Kirk, he was a convivial man, known as ''Bonum Magnum'' for his capacity for claret. His wife's nephew Boswell often mentions dining with the family.\n\nHis two eldest sons, John (b. 1738) and [[James Webster (officer)|James]] (b. 1740), served in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. John was a Captain in the 4th Regiment of Foot. James ('Jamie') was especially well regarded as Lieutenant-Colonel of the 33rd Foot, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]]'s own regiment, and acting Brigadier. When he died of wounds after the [[battle of Guilford Courthouse]] in 1781, Cornwallis wrote a touching letter of condolence to Alexander Webster.\n\nHe is buried beside Mary in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]], Edinburgh, in a now-unmarked grave.\n\n==Notes==\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2014 }}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]], ''Traditions of Edinburgh'', 1824.\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Webster, Alexander |volume=28 |page=459}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Webster, Alexander\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Moderator of the general Assembly of the Church of Scotland\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1708\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = January 25, 1784\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Webster, Alexander}}\n[[Category:1708 births]]\n[[Category:1784 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Burials at Greyfriars Kirkyard]]\n[[Category:Ministers of the Church of Scotland]]\n[[Category:Scottish non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Webster]]\n[[Category:People from Fife]]\n[[Category:Scottish statisticians]]\n[[Category:British actuaries]]\n[[Category:18th-century Christian clergy]]\n[[Category:18th-century Scottish people]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Alexander Webster"}}}}
