At this point he was drafted to [[Labour service (Hungary)|forced labour service]], escaped, and completed his [[Ph.D.]] in 1947 at the [[University of Szeged]], under the advisement of [[Frigyes Riesz]]. He married Katalin Schulhof (who used Kató Rényi as her married name), herself a mathematician, in 1946; their daughter Zsuzsanna was born in 1948. After a brief assistant professorship at Budapest, he was appointed Professor Extraordinary at the [[University of Debrecen]] in 1949. In 1950, he founded the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics|Mathematics Research Institute]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], now bearing his name, and directed it until his early death. He also headed the Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics of the [[Eötvös Loránd University]], from 1952. He was elected a corresponding member (1949), full member (1956) of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]\n\n==Work==\nRényi proved, using the [[large sieve]], that there is a number <math>K</math> such that every even number is the sum of a prime number and a number that can be written as the product of at most <math>K</math> primes. [[Chen's theorem]], a strengthening of this result, shows that the theorem is true for ''K''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, for all sufficiently large even numbers. The case ''K''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 is the still-unproven [[Goldbach conjecture]].\n\nIn [[information theory]], he introduced the spectrum of [[Rényi entropy|Rényi entropies]] of order α, giving an important generalisation of the [[Shannon entropy]] and the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]].  The Rényi entropies give a spectrum of useful [[diversity indices]], and lead to a spectrum of [[fractal dimension]]s. The [[Rényi–Ulam game]] is a guessing game where some of the answers may be wrong.\n\nIn probability theory, he is also known for his [[Rényi's parking constants|parking constants]], which characterize the solution to the following problem: given a street of given length and cars of constant length parking on a random free position on the street, what is the density of cars when there are no more free positions? The solution to that problem is approximately equal to 74.75979% {{OEIS|A050996}}.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RenyisParkingConstants.html] Wolfram Mathworld on Rényi's parking constants</ref>\n\nHe wrote 32 joint papers with [[Paul Erdős]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/upload/docs/Erdos%20Number%20Project/erdtrib.pdf| title= Paul Erdős: The Master of Collaboration, Jerrold W.

It has been suggested that this sentence was originally formulated in German, where it can be interpreted as a wordplay on the double meaning of the word ''Satz'' (theorem or coffee residue), but it is more likely that the original formulation was in Hungarian.<ref>{{citation|url=http://pachjanos.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/anastasatos-conjecture/|title=Anastasatos’ Conjecture|first=János|last=Pach|authorlink=János Pach|date=December 16, 2010}}.</ref>\n\nHe is also famous for having said, \"If I feel unhappy, I do mathematics to become happy.
