The first theory, the [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory]], was supported by such thinkers as [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]]. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by [[Aristotle]] and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as [[al-Kindi]]) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the ''Book of Optics'' was from Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy#Optics|''Optics'']], while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account.<ref>{{harv|Smith|2001|p=lxxix}}</ref> Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory which successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of [[Galen]], and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that \"from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point\".<ref name=\"Lindberg 1976 73\">{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=73}}</ref> This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.<ref name=\"Lindberg 1976 73\"/> He attempted to resolve this by asserting that only perpendicular rays from the object would be perceived by the eye; for any one point on the eye, only the ray which reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued using a physical analogy that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays; in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=74}}</ref> He later asserted (in book seven of the ''Optics'') that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived ''as if'' perpendicular.<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=76}}</ref>\n\nHis arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why ''only'' perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=75}}</ref> His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|pages=76–78}}</ref> However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe: \"Directly or indirectly, his ''De Aspectibus'' inspired much of the activity in optics which occurred between the 13th and 17th centuries.\" <ref name=\"Lindberg 1976 86\">{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=86}}</ref> [[Kepler]]'s later theory of the [[retina]]l image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.<ref name=\"Lindberg 1976 86\"/>\n\nAlhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with [[lens (optics)|lenses]], [[mirror]]s, [[refraction]], and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]].<ref name=Deek/> He was the\nfirst to consider separately the vertical and horizontal components of reflected and refracted light rays, which was an important step in understanding optics geometrically.<ref>{{harv|Heeffer|2003}}</ref>\n\nThe [[camera obscura]] was known to the [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] and was described by the [[Han Chinese]] [[polymath]]ic [[genius]] [[Shen Kuo]] in his scientific book [[Dream Pool Essays]] which was printed and published in the year 1088 C.E.. Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his ''Problems'', however Alhazen's work also contained the first clear description, outside of [[History of Science and Technology in China|China]], of [[camera obscura]] in the areas of the [[middle east]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[India]].<ref name=Kelley>{{harv|Kelley|Milone|Aveni|2005|p=83}}: {{quote|\"The first clear description of the device appears in the ''Book of Optics'' of Alhazen.\"}}</ref> and early analysis<ref name=Wade>{{harv|Wade|Finger|2001}}: {{quote|\"The principles of the camera obscura first began to be correctly analysed in the eleventh century, when they were outlined by Ibn al-Haytham.\"}}</ref> of the device.\n\nAlhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the [[visual system]]. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 ''[[Perception (journal)|Perception]]'' article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories which were previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century [[Hering's law of equal innervation]]; he had a description of vertical [[horopter]]s which predates [[Aguilonius]] by 600 years and is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's; and his work on [[binocular disparity]] was repeated by Panum in 1858.<ref name=Howard>{{harv|Howard|1996}}</ref> Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from [[Ptolemy]], who Alhazen was extremely familiar with. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.<ref name=\"AaenStockdale\"/> In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.<ref name=Wade-1998>{{harv|Wade|1998|pages=240,316,334,367}}</ref><ref name=Howard-Wade-1996>{{harv|Howard|Wade|1996|pages=1195,1197,1200}}</ref> In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune<ref name=Lejeune>{{harv|Lejeune|1958}}</ref> and Sabra,<ref name=Sabra>{{harv|Sabra|1989}}</ref> Raynaud<ref name=Raynaud>{{harv|Raynaud|2003}}</ref> showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-Müller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.\n\nAlhazen's most original contribution was that after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system.<ref>Gul A.

Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics (''ilm tabi'i'') with mathematics (''ta'alim''; geometry in particular). This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''The Optics''; ''De aspectibus'' or ''Perspectivae'') and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and [[dioptrics]] (the study of the refraction of light).<ref name=Bizri-2005>{{harv|El-Bizri|2005a}} <br/> {{harv|El-Bizri|2005b}}</ref> <!-- [[Bradley Steffens]] in his book ''Ibn Al-Haytham: First Scientist'' has argued that Alhazen's approach to testing and experimentation made an important contribution to the scientific method. --> According to Matthias Schramm, Alhazen: <blockquote>was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the [[moonlight]] through two small [[apertures]] onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up.<ref name=Toomer-463-4>{{harv|Toomer|1964|pp=463–4}}</ref></blockquote> G.

It comprises drawing lines from two points in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of a circle meeting at a point on the [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular [[billiard table]] at which a cue ball at a given point must be aimed in order to carom off the edge of the table and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, \"Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.\" This leads to an [[Quartic equation|equation of the fourth degree]].<ref name=MacTutor/><ref>{{harv|Weisstein}}</ref> This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an [[Integral|integration]], where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [[paraboloid]].<ref name=Katz>{{harv|Katz|1995|pp=165–9 & 173–4}}</ref> Alhazen eventually solved the problem using [[conic section]]s and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. Later mathematicians used [[Descartes]]' analytical methods to analyse the problem,<ref name=Smith>{{harv|Smith|1992}}</ref> with a new solution being found in 1997 by the Oxford mathematician [[Peter M. Neumann]].<ref>{{harv|Highfield|1997}}</ref> Recently, [[Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories]] (MERL) researchers Amit Agrawal, Yuichi Taguchi and Srikumar Ramalingam solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors.<ref>{{harv|Agrawal|Taguchi|Ramalingam|2011}}</ref> They showed that the mirror reflection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case. If the camera (eye) is placed on the axis of the mirror, the degree of the equation reduces to six.<ref name=AgrawalECCV10>{{harv|Agrawal|Taguchi|Ramalingam|2010}}</ref> Alhazen's problem can also be extended to multiple refractions from a spherical ball. Given a light source and a spherical ball of certain refractive index, the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is refracted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation.<ref name=AgrawalECCV10/>\n\n===Refraction===\n\n{{harvnb|Smith|2010}} has noted that Alhazen's treatment of refraction describes an experimental setup without publication of data.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith| 2010}}{{rp|para.[3.33],p.259,footnote67.}} Note 67 is on p.361.

One generation before Alhazen, [[Ibn Sahl]] discovered his statement of the lengths of the hypotenuse for each incident and refracted right triangle, respectively. This is equivalent to Descartes' formulation for refraction. Alhazen's convention for describing the incident and refracted angles is still in use. His failure to publish his data is an open question.\n\n=== Other contributions ===\n\nThe Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics) describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies. He conducted experiments with [[projectile]]s, and a description of his conclusions is: \"it was only the impact of [[perpendicular]] projectiles on surfaces which was forceful enough to enable them to penetrate whereas the [[Oblique angle|oblique]] ones were deflected. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw would break the slate and pass through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance would not.\"<ref name=\"Russell\">Gul A.

(2002) ''The mystery of the moon illusion: Exploring size perception''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky, a debate that is still unresolved. Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]] and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.<ref>{{harv|Hershenson|1989| pp=9–10}}</ref> Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. [[Cleomedes]] ({{circa}} 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to [[Posidonius]] ({{circa}} 135-50 BC).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = H.E. | date = 2000 | title = Cleomedes {{circa}} 1st century AD) on the celestial illusion, atmospheric enlargement and size-distance invariance | journal = Perception | volume = 29 | pages = 853–861 | doi=10.1068/p2937}}</ref> Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his ''Optics'', but the text is obscure.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = H.E. | last2 = Ross | first2 = G.M. | date = 1976 | title = Did Ptolemy understand the moon illusion? | journal = Perception | volume = 5 | pages = 377–385 | doi=10.1068/p050377}}</ref> Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit.\n\n== Other works on physics ==\n\n=== Optical treatises ===\n\nBesides the ''Book of Optics'', Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his ''Risala fi l-Daw’'' (''Treatise on Light''). He investigated the properties of [[luminance]], the [[rainbow]], [[eclipse]]s, twilight, and [[moonlight]]. Experiments with mirrors and [[Magnifying glass|magnifying lenses]] provided the foundation for his theories on [[catoptrics]].<ref name=Bizri>{{harv|El-Bizri|2006}}</ref>\n\n=== Celestial physics ===\n\nAlhazen discussed the [[physics]] of the celestial region in his ''Epitome of Astronomy'', arguing that Ptolemaic models needed to be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses; in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred [[Ptolemaic model]] \"greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West\". Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses \"were accountable to the [[Physical law|laws of physics]]\", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.<ref>{{harv|Duhem|1969|p=28}}</ref>\n\nHe also wrote ''Maqala fi daw al-qamar'' (''On the Light of the Moon'').\n\n=== Mechanics ===\n\nIn his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of a body.<ref name=Bizri/> In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a void, and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.<ref name=Bizri-2007/>\n\n{{anchor|Astronomy}}<!-- -Anchor for a wikilink in Celestial Spheres article.

It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.<ref>{{harv|Langerman|1990}}, chap. 2, sect. 22, p. 61</ref>}}\n\nThe book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], which was eventually translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]] in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as [[Georg von Peuerbach]]<ref name=Britannica/> during the European [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].<ref>{{harv|Langerman|1990|pp=34–41}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Gondhalekar|2001|p=21}}</ref>\n\n=== Doubts Concerning Ptolemy ===\n\nIn his ''Al-Shukūk ‛alā Batlamyūs'', variously translated as ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' or ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Almagest'', ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and ''Optics'', pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the ''Hypotheses'' concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.<ref name=\"Sabra 1998\">{{harv|Sabra|1998}}</ref> He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the [[equant]], failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:<ref>{{harv|Langerman|1990|pp=8–10}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (''hay'a'') that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist...

Alhazen's belief was that there was a \"true configuration\" of the planets which Ptolemy had failed to grasp; his intention was to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.<ref name=\"Sabra 1998\"/>\n\nIn the ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:\n\n{{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...<ref name=Sabra/>}}\n\nHe held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.\n\n=== Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets ===\n\nAlhazen's ''The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' was written {{circa}} 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his ''Doubts on Ptolemy'', Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of [[epicycles]] to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's [[equant]]. In general, his model made no attempt to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description which could be used to explain observed motions, without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.<ref name=\"Harv|Rashed|2007\">{{harv|Rashed|2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Other astronomical works ===\n\nAlhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as ''Exact Determination of the Meridian'', a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the [[Milky Way]]; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars.<ref>{{harv|Mohamed|2000|pp=49–50}}</ref> The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the ''Doubts'' and ''Model of the Motions'' discussed above.<ref name=\"Rashed 2007 8–9\">{{harv|Rashed|2007|pp=8–9}}</ref>\n\n== Mathematical works ==\n\nIn [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], Alhazen built on the mathematical works of [[Euclid]] and [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] and worked on \"the beginnings of the link between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]].\"<ref name=Faruqi>{{harv|Faruqi|2006|pp=395–6}}:\n{{quote|In seventeenth century Europe the problems formulated by Ibn al-Haytham (965–1041) became known as 'Alhazen's problem'.

Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines&nbsp;– made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the thirteenth century, while revising Alhazen's ''Book of Optics'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') – was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources.

The asteroid [[59239 Alhazen]] was also named in his honour.\n\nIn 2014, the \"[[Hiding in the Light]]\" episode of ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', presented by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], focused on the accomplishments of Ibn al-Haytham. He was voiced by [[Alfred Molina]] in the episode.\n\n[[UNESCO]] has declared 2015 the [[International Year of Light]]. Amongst others, this will be celebrating Ibn Al-Haytham's achievements in optics, mathematics and astronomy. An international campaign, created by the [[1001 Inventions]] organisation, titled '''1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham''' featuring a series of interactive exhibits, workshops and live shows about his work will partner with science centers, science festivals, museums, and educational institutions, as well as digital and social media platforms.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/1000_years_of_arabic_optics_to_be_a_focus_of_the_international_year_of_light_in_2015 |title=1000 Years of Arabic Optics to be a Focus of the International Year of Light in 2015 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref> The campaign also produced and released the short educational film [[1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham]], which is notable for being the final movie role for actor [[Omar Sharif]] before his death in July 2015<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/omar-sharif-dead-doctor-zhivago-789643 |title=Omar Sharif, Suave Star of 'Doctor Zhivago,' Dies at 83 |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=23 July 2015}}</ref> 1001 Inventions is a founding partner of the [[International Year of Light]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.light2015.org/Home/About/Latest-News/November2014/Ibn-Al-Haytham-to-be-the-focus-of-the-International-Year-of-Light-through-partnering-with-1001-Inventions-.html |title=Ibn Al-Haytham to be a focus of the International Year of Light through partnering with 1001 Inventions |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n \nUNESCO's website <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.light2015.org/Home/ScienceStories/1000-Years-of-Arabic-Optics.html |title=1000 Years of Arabic Optics}}</ref> on Ibn al-Haytham copies a part from [[Jim Al-Khalili]]'s popular history ''Pathfinders: The Golden Age of Arabic Science''.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Hiding in the Light]]\n*[[History of mathematics]]\n*[[History of optics]]\n*[[History of physics]]\n*[[History of science]]\n*[[History of scientific method]]\n*[[Hockney–Falco thesis]]\n*[[Mathematics in medieval Islam]]\n*[[Physics in medieval Islam]]\n*[[Science in the medieval Islamic world]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"n\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n\n* {{Citation\n |last=Aaen-Stockdale\n |first=C.
