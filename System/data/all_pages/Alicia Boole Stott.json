Despite never holding an academic position, she made a number of valuable contributions to the field.<ref name=\"MathsWomen\"/> She is best known for coining the term \"[[polytope]]\" for a convex solid in four (or more) dimensions, and having an impressive grasp of [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional geometry]] from a very early age.<ref name=\"MathsWomen\"/>\n\n==Early life==\nAlicia Boole was born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Ireland]], the third daughter of mathematician and logician [[George Boole]] and [[Mary Everest Boole]], a self-taught mathematician and educationalist. Many of her sisters were notable in their own right. [[Lucy Everest Boole]] was a chemist and pharmacist and [[Ethel Lilian Voynich]] was a novelist. After her father's sudden death in 1864 the family moved to London where her mother became the librarian at [[Queen's College, London]].<ref name=\"Labcoats and Lace\">{{cite book|author1=Des MacHale|author2=Anne Mac Lellan|authorlink1=The Fabulous Boole Sisters|editor1-last=Mulvihill|editor1-first=Mary|title=Lab Coats and Lace|publisher=Women in Technology and Science|isbn=9780953195312}}</ref> She attended the school attached to Queens' College with her sister, but never attended university.\n\n==Early career==\nAlicia was the only Boole sister to inherit her father's mathematical talent. She was first exposed to geometric models by her brother-in-law [[Charles Howard Hinton]] when she was just 18, and developed the ability to visualise in a fourth dimension.<ref name=\"MathsWomen\">{{cite web|title=Notable Women in Mathematics: A Biographical Dictionary |last1=Morrow |first1=Charlene |last2=Perl |first2=Teri|url=http://www.questia.com/doc/1P3-2131107461.html# |pages=243–245|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |accessdate=4 January 2015|subscription=yes|year=1998 |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Labcoats and Lace\" /> She found that there were exactly [[Convex regular polychoron|six regular polytopes in four dimensions]] and that they are bounded by 5, 16 or 600 [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]], 8 [[cube]]s, 24 [[octahedron|octahedra]] or 120 [[dodecahedron|dodecahedra]]. (Though this was already known to [[Ludwig Schläfli|Schläfli]]) She then produced three-dimensional central cross-sections of all the six regular polytopes by purely [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] constructions and [[synthetic geometry|synthetic]] methods for the simple reason that she had never learned any [[analytic geometry]]. She made cardboard models of all these sections. She coined the term 'polytopes' to describe them.\n\n==Later career==\nAfter taking up secretarial work near [[Liverpool]] in 1889 she met and married [[Walter Stott]], an actuary, in 1890. They had two children together, Mary (1891-1982) and Leonard (1892-1963).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Polo-Blanco|first=Irene|title=Alicia Boole Stott, a geometer in higher dimension|journal=Historia Mathematica|date=May 2008|volume=35|issue=2|pages=123–139|doi=10.1016/j.hm.2007.10.008|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0315086007000973}}</ref> Stott learned of [[Pieter Schoute]]'s work on central sections of the regular polytopes in 1895. Schoute came to England and worked with Alicia Stott, persuading her to publish her results which she did in two papers published in Amsterdam in 1900 and 1910.<ref name=\"rouse_ball_1960\">[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1960) ''Mrs. Stott's Construction'', in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, pp 139-140.</ref>\n\nAfter Schoute's death in 1923 Alicia took a hiatus from mathematical work. The [[University of Groningen]] honoured her by inviting her to attend the tercentenary celebrations of the university and awarding her an honorary doctorate in 1914.<ref name=\"BioMath\">{{cite web|title=Biographical Encyclopedia of Mathematicians - Vol. 2 |last=Franceschetti |first=Donald R.|url=https://www.questia.com/read/119349129/biographical-encyclopedia-of-mathematicians |pages=482–484|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]] |accessdate=4 January 2015|subscription=yes|year=1999 |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1930 she was introduced by her nephew [[G. I. Taylor|Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]] to [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H.S.M. Coxeter]] and they worked together on various problems.<ref name=\"BioMath\"/> Alicia made two further important discoveries relating to constructions for polyhedra related to the golden section. She presented a joint paper with Coxeter at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. Coxeter later wrote, \"The strength and simplicity of her character combined with the diversity of her interests to make her an inspiring friend.\"<ref name=\"Labcoats and Lace\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nAlicia died in Middlesex in 1940.<ref name=\"BioMath\"/> In Spring 2001 a paper roll of coloured drawings of polyhedra was found at Groningen University.<ref name=\"Labcoats and Lace\" /> Though unsigned, it was immediately recognised as Alicia's work. It led to research by Irene Polo-Blanco. Polo-Blanco dedicated a chapter to Alicia's work in her book Theory and History of Mathematical Models (2007). Alicia's son Leonard became a pioneer in the treatment of tuberculosis and invented an artificial pneumothorax apparatus.\n\n==Publications (external links)==\n*[http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/toegangen/digital-library-knaw/?pagetype=publDetail&pId=PU00011492 A.
