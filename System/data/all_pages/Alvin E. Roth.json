J. Mullen in 1952.  The system was built on theoretical foundations independently introduced by [[David Gale]] and [[Lloyd Shapley]] in 1962.<ref>D. Gale and L. S.

August 24, 2004.</ref>\n\n=== New York City public school system ===\nRoth later helped design the market to match New York City public school students to high schools as incoming freshmen.  Previously, the school district had students mail in a list of their five preferred schools in rank order, then mailed a photocopy of that list to each of the five schools.  As a result, schools could tell whether or not students had listed them as their first choice.  This meant that some students ''really'' had a choice of one school, rather than five.  It also meant that students had an incentive to hide their true preferences. Roth and his colleagues Atila Abdulkadiroğlu and [[Parag Pathak]] proposed David Gale and Lloyd Shapley's [[Incentive compatibility|incentive-compatible]] student proposing [[deferred acceptance algorithm]] to the school board in 2003. The school board accepted the measure as the method of selection for New York City public school students.\n<ref>Alvin E. Roth (2005).

Pathak, and [[Tayfun Sonmez]], Roth presented a similar measure to Boston's public school system in 2003. Here the Boston system gave so much preference to an applicant's first choice that were a student to not receive her first or second choice it was likely that she would not be matched with any school on her list and be administratively assigned to schools which had vacancies.\n<ref>Gareth Cook (2003).
