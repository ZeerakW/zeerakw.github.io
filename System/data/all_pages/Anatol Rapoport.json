He contributed to [[general systems theory]], [[mathematical biology]] and to the mathematical modeling of social interaction and [[stochastic]] models of contagion.\n\n==Biography==\nRapoport was born in Lozоvaya, [[Kharkov Governorate]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] (in today's [[Kharkiv Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]) into a [[Jewish Secularism|secular Jewish]] family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rapoport|first1=Anatol|title=Conceptions of World Order: Building Peace in the Third Millennium|publisher=Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution|url=http://scar.gmu.edu/op_12_rapoport.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> In 1922, he came to the United States, and in 1928 he became a [[naturalized citizen]]. He started studying music in [[Chicago]] and continued with [[piano]], [[conducting]] and [[musical composition|composition]] at the [[Vienna]] [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Hochschule für Musik]] where he studied from 1929 to 1934. However, due to the rise of [[Nazism]], he found it impossible to make a career as a pianist.<ref>Alisa Ferguson, \"Rapoport was Renowned Mathematical Psychologist, Peace Activist, ''University of Toronto Bulletin'', February 20, 2007</ref>\n\nHe shifted his career into [[mathematics]], getting a Ph.D. degree in mathematics under [[Otto Schilling]] and [[Abraham Adrian Albert]]  at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1941 on the thesis ''Construction of Non-Abelian Fields with Prescribed Arithmetic''.<ref>{{Mathgenealogy|id=6378}}</ref> According to the ''[[Toronto Globe and Mail]]'', he was a member of the [[American Communist Party]] for three years, but quit before enlisting in the U.S. [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] in 1941, serving in [[Alaska]] and [[India]] during [[World War&nbsp;II]].<ref name=\"Ron Csillag 2007\">Ron Csillag,\"Anatol Rapoport, Academic 1911-2007.\" ''Globe and Mail'' (Toronto), January 31, 2007, p. S7</ref>\n\nAfter the war, he joined the Committee on Mathematical Biology at the University of Chicago (1947–54), publishing his first book, ''Science and the Goals of Man'', co-authored with semanticist [[S.&nbsp;I. Hayakawa]] in 1950. He also received a one-year fellowship at the prestigious [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] in [[Stanford]], [[California]].\n\nFrom 1955 to 1970, Rapoport was Professor of Mathematical Biology and Senior Research Mathematician at the [[University of Michigan]], as well as founding member, in 1955, of the Mental Health Research Institute (MHRI) at the University of Michigan. In 1970 Rapoport moved to [[Toronto]] to avoid the war-making ways of the Vietnam-era [[United States]]. He was appointed professor of mathematics and psychology at the [[University of Toronto]] (1970–79). He lived in bucolic [[Wychwood Park]] overlooking downtown Toronto, a neighbour of [[Marshall McLuhan]]. On his retirement from the University of Toronto, he became director of the [[Institute of Advanced Studies (Vienna)]] until 1983.\n\nIn 1954 Anatol Rapoport cofounded the [[Society for General Systems Research]], along with the researchers [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Ralph Gerard]], and [[Kenneth Boulding]]. He became president of the [[Society for General Systems Research]] in 1965.\n\nAnatol Rapoport died of [[pneumonia]] in Toronto. He is survived by his wife Gwen, daughter Anya, and sons Alexander and Anthony.\n\n==Work==\nRapoport contributed to [[general systems theory]], [[mathematical biology]], and to the mathematical modeling of social interaction and [[stochastic]] models of contagion. He combined his mathematical expertise with psychological insights into the study of [[game theory]], [[social networks]], and [[semantics]].\n\nRapoport extended these understandings into studies of psychological conflict, dealing with [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[Arms control|disarmament]] and international politics. His autobiography, ''Certainties and Doubts: A Philosophy of Life'', was published in 2001.\n\n===Game theory===\nRapoport had a versatile mind, working in [[mathematics]], [[psychology]], [[biology]], [[game theory]], [[social network]] analysis, and peace and conflict studies. For example, he pioneered in the modeling of parasitism and [[symbiosis]], researching [[Cybernetics|cybernetic theory]]. This went on to give a conceptual basis for his lifelong work in conflict and cooperation.\n\nAmong many other well-known books on fights, games, violence, and peace, Rapoport was the author of over 300 articles and of \"Two-Person Game Theory\" (1966) and \"[[Game theory#Many-player and population games|N-Person]] Game Theory\" (2001). He analyzed contests in which there are more than two sets of conflicting interests, such as war, diplomacy, [[poker]], or bargaining. His work led him to peace research, including books on ''The Origins of Violence'' (1989) and ''Peace, An Idea Whose Time Has Come'' (1993).\n\nHe won a computer tournament in the 1980s, based on [[Robert Axelrod]]'s ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]'', which sought to understand how cooperation could emerge through [[evolution]]. The contenders had to present pieces of software that would play iterated games of the [[prisoner's dilemma]] against each other. Rapoport's entry, ''[[Tit for tat|Tit-For-Tat]]'' has only four lines of code. The program opens by cooperating with its opponent. It then plays exactly as the other side played in the previous game. If the other side defected in the previous game, the program also defects; but only for one game. If the other side cooperates, the program continues to cooperate. According to ''Peace Magazine'' author/editor [[Metta Spencer]], the program \"punished the other player for selfish behaviour and rewarded her for cooperative behaviour—but the punishment lasted only as long as the selfish behaviour lasted. This proved to be an exceptionally effective sanction, quickly showing the other side the advantages of cooperating. It also set moral philosophers to proposing this as a workable principle to use in real life interactions\".\n\nHis children report that he was a strong chess player but a bad poker player because he non-verbally revealed the strength of his hands.<ref name=\"Ron Csillag 2007\" />\n\n===Social network analysis===\nAnatol Rapoport was an early developer of [[social network]] analysis. His original work showed that one can measure large networks by profiling traces of flows through them. This enables learning about the speed of the distribution of resources, including information, and what speeds or impedes these flows—such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[socioeconomic status]], proximity, and [[kinship]].<ref>Harrison White, ''Identity and Control'', 2nd ed., Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007</ref> This work linked social networks to the [[diffusion of innovation]], and by extension, to [[epidemiology]]. Rapoport's empirical work traced the spread of information within a school. It prefigured the study of [[six degrees of separation]], by showing the rapid spread of information in a population to almost all—but not all—school members (see references below).\n\n===Conflict and peace studies===\nAccording to [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]] in the ''Toronto Globe and Mail'', Rapoport \"became anti-militarist quite soon after the [[World War II|war]]. The idea of military values became anathema\". He was a leading organizer of the first [[teach-ins]] against the [[Vietnam War]] at the University of Michigan, a model that spread rapidly throughout North America. He told at a teach-in: \"By undertaking the war against Vietnam, the United States has undertaken a war against humanity...This war we shall not win\". (''Ann Arbor News'', April 1967). He said he was an abolitionist, rather than a total [[pacifist]]: \"I'm for killing the institution of war\". In 1968, he signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>“Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” January 30, 1968, ''[[New York Post]]''.</ref>\n\nRapoport returned to the [[University of Toronto]] to become the founding (and unpaid) Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies programme, working with [[George Ignatieff]] and Canada's [[Science for Peace]] organization. As its sole professor at the start, he used a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to the study of peace, integrating mathematics, politics, psychology, philosophy, science, and sociology. His main concern was to legitimize peace studies as a worthy academic pursuit. The [[Trudeau Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies]] continued to flourish at the University of Toronto under the leadership of Thomas Homer-Dixon, and, from 2008, under [[Ron Levi]]. When Rapoport began, there was one (unpaid) professor and twelve students. Now, there are three (paid) professors and ninety students.<ref>Alisa Ferguson, \"Rapoport was Renowned Mathematical Psychologist, Peace Activist,\" ''University of Toronto Bulletin'', February 20, 2007</ref>\n\nRapoport's students report that he was an engaged and inspiring professor who captured their attention, imagination and interest with his wide-ranging knowledge, passion for the subject, good humor, kind and generous spirit, attentiveness to student concerns, and animated teaching style.<ref>Chesmak Farhoumand-Sims, \"Memories of Anatol Rapoport,\" ''Peace Magazine'', April 2007, p. 14</ref>\n\nIn 1980, his famous [[tit for tat]] strategy for the [[iterated prisoner's dilemma]] tournament held by [[Robert Axelrod]] was published and in 1981 Rapoport co-founded the international [[non-governmental organization]] ''[[Science for Peace]]''. He was recognized in the 1980s for his contribution to world peace through nuclear conflict restraint via his game theoretic models of psychological [[conflict resolution]]. He won the [[Lenz International Peace Research Prize]] in 1976. Professor Rapoport was also a member of the editorial board of the International Scholarly [http://www.library.utoronto.ca/iip/journal/home.htm ''Journal of Environmental Peace''] published by the [http://www.library.utoronto.ca/iip/ ''International Innovation Projects''] at the University of Toronto edited by Biswajit (Bob) Ganguly and Roger I.&nbsp;C.
