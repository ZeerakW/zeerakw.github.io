He later went on to a position at the University of Dorpat (then belonging to Russia, now [[University of Tartu]] in Estonia) where he worked for around seven years on theoretical astronomy.  He combined practical astronomy with an interest in theory,<ref name=runeberg/> developing especially an interest in the [[three body problem]]<ref>{{cite journal|last = Lindstedt|first = A.|title = Über die Bestimmung der gegenseitigen Entfernungen in dem Probleme der drei Körper|journal = Astronomische Nachrichten|volume = 107|issue = 13–14|year = 1884|pages = 197–214|bibcode = 1884AN....107..197L|doi = 10.1002/asna.18841071301}} (Roughly translated, the title of this paper is \"On determining the mutual distances in the [[three body problem]]\".),</ref> This work was to influence Poincaré<ref>Jules Henri Poincaré (1890) \"Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique.

He made contributions to the theory of [[pension funds]] and worked as a member of government committees responsible for [[insurance law]] and [[social insurance]]. He became a corresponding member of the [[Institute of Actuaries]] in London. He was for a time Kings Inspector of insurance companies.\n\nIn 1909 he resigned his professorial position to work full-time on [[insurance]]. From 1909 to 1916 Lindstedt was also a Justice of the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden]]. In 1912 Lindstedt constructed a [[life table]] for [[Annuity (European financial arrangements)|annuities]]<ref>Cramer H and H Wold (1935), [[wikt:mortality|Mortality]] variations in Sweden: a study in graduation and forecasting, Skandinavisk Aktuarietidskrift, 18: 161–241</ref> using data from Swedish population experience and for each age was able to  [[extrapolate]] the sequence of annual [[probability]] of death, namely the mortality profile.
