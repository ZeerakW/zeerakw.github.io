[[Joseph Oscar Irwin|Irwin]] (see below) commented on the quality of his work, \"Although an amateur, he was a brilliant mathematician, with a far greater insight than many professionals.\"\n\nMcKendrick was born in [[Edinburgh]] the fifth and last child of [[John Gray McKendrick]]  FRS, a distinguished [[physiologist]]. The son trained as a doctor at the [[University of Glasgow]] and joined the Indian Medical Service. He worked with [[Ronald Ross]] and eventually would continue his work on mathematical epidemiology. His primary interest was in research and he became director of the [[Pasteur Institute]] at [[Kasauli]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. He was invalided home to Britain in 1920 and settled in Edinburgh where he became Superintendent of the Laboratory of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]]. He held this post for the rest of his life.\n\nMcKendrick's career as a mathematical epidemiologist began in [[India]]. In 1911, McKendrick rediscovered the [[Logistic function|logistic equation]] and fit it to bacterial growth data.<ref>http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0370164600025426</ref>  In 1914 he published a paper in which he gave equations for the pure birth process and a particular [[birth-death process]]. After his return to Scotland he published more. His 1926 paper, 'Applications of mathematics to medical problems' was particularly impressive, including\nthe widely used [[McKendrick–Von Foerster equation|McKendrick–Von Foerster]] [[partial differential equation]]\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial a} = - \\mu(t,a) n. </math>\n\n<!-- where n is.... and t is.... and a is..... and μ is.... -->\nSome of this papers other results for stochastic models of epidemics and population growth were rediscovered by [[William Feller]] in 1939. Feller remarks in his Introduction to the Theory of Probability & its Applications (3rd edition p.&nbsp;450), \"It is unfortunate that this remarkable paper passed practically unnoticed.\" The same paper is also the earliest reference in Dempster et al.'s 1977 paper that defined and popularized the EM algorithm ([[expectation-maximization algorithm]]) In 1927 McKendrick  began a collaboration with W. O. Kermack (1898–1970) which produced a notable series of papers on the [[Kermack–McKendrick theory]], a general theory of infectious disease transmission.\n\nW. M. Hirsch gives this picture of the man: \"McKendrick was a truly Christian gentleman, a tall and handsome man, brilliant in mind, kind and modest in person, a skilful counsellor and administrator who gave of himself and knew how to enable others.\"\n\n==Selected works==\n*A.
