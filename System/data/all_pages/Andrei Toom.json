Currently, Toom is a retired professor of the [[statistics]] department at [[Federal University of Pernambuco]].\n\nToom's English-language mathematics articles, published in journals such as the [[Journal of Statistical Physics]], include \"Non-Ergodic Multidimensional Systems of Automata,\" \"[[Stochastic cellular automata|Discrete Local Markov Systems]],\" \"On Critical Phenomena in Interacting Growth Systems,\" \"[[Cellular Automata with Errors: Problems for Students of Probability]],\" \"Simple 1-Dimensional Systems with Super-Exponential Relaxation Time,\" \"Tails in Harnesses,\" \"On Percolation with Fibers or Layers,\" and \"Non-Gibbsianness of the invariant measures of non-reversible cellular automata with totally asymmetric noise\".\n\nHis English-language articles on education include \"A Russian Teacher in America,\" \"From Russia with Math,\" \"How I Teach Word Problems,\" \"Word problems: Applications vs. Mental Manipulatives,\" \"Between Childhood and Mathematics: Word Problems in Mathematical Education,\" and the unpublished manuscript, \"Wars in American Mathematical Education\". \n\n==References==\n*[http://www.toomandre.com/ His personal Website]\n*[http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.jsp?id=K4769482J7 His curriculum, in Portuguese and Lattes formatted (Brazilian standard curriculum form)] {{pt icon}}\n* {{MathGenealogy|id=105760}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Toom, Andrei\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Russian mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1942\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Toom, Andrei}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Cellular automatists]]\n[[Category:Russian people of Jewish descent]]\n[[Category:Russian people of Estonian descent]]\n[[Category:Russian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Jewish scientists]]\n[[Category:Probability theorists]]\n\n\n{{russia-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Andrei Toom"}}}}
