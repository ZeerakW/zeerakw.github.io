His unmarried mother, Maria Y. Kolmogorova, died giving birth to him.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s. v. \"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321441/Andrey-Nikolayevich-Kolmogorov Andrey Nikolayevich Kolmogorov]\", accessed February 22, 2013.</ref> Andrey was raised by two of his aunts in [[Tunoshna]] (near [[Yaroslavl]]) at the estate of his grandfather, a well-to-do [[Russian nobility|nobleman]].\n\nLittle is known about Andrey's father. He was supposedly named Nikolai Matveevich Kataev and had been an [[Agronomy|agronomist]]. Nikolai had been exiled from [[St. Petersburg]] to the Yaroslavl province after his participation in the revolutionary movement against the [[czar]]s. He disappeared in 1919 and he was presumed to have been killed in the [[Russian Civil War]].\n\nAndrey Kolmogorov was educated in his aunt Vera's village school, and his earliest literary efforts and mathematical papers were printed in the school journal \"The Swallow of Spring\". Andrey (at the age of five) was the \"editor\" of the mathematical section of this journal. Kolmogorov's first mathematical discovery was published in this journal: at the age of five he noticed the regularity in the sum of the series of odd numbers.\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n1 & = 1^2, \\\\\n1 + 3 & = 2^2, \\\\\n1 + 3 + 5 & = 3^2, \\\\\n1 + 3 + 5 +7 & = 4^2,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\netc.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wolf Prize in Mathematics, v.2|date=2001|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789812811769|pages=119–141|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=GHFtMc9NTkYC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=Kolmogorov+discovered+first+mathematical+regularity+at+the+age+five+year&source=bl&ots=E7MnURHoce&sig=9JPGhyIxfo6TxeeFuGmiaHBHKF4&hl=ru&sa=X&ei=_JSiVPeVN4bVygP9roKgDw&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Kolmogorov%20discovered%20first%20mathematical%20regularity%20at%20the%20age%20five%20year&f=false|chapter=Andrei N Kolmogorov prepared by V M Tikhomirov}}</ref>\n\nIn 1910, his aunt adopted him, and they moved to Moscow, where he graduated from [[gymnasium (school)|high school]] in 1920. Later that same year, Kolmogorov began to study at the [[Moscow State University]] and at the same time [[Mendeleev Moscow Institute of Chemistry and Technology]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Андрей Николаевич КОЛМОГОРОВ. Curriculum Vitae|url=http://new.math.msu.su/department/probab/Kolmogorov/ank_cv.html}}</ref> Kolmogorov writes about this time: \"I arrived at Moscow University with a fair knowledge of mathematics.

While an undergraduate student in college, he attended the seminars of the Russian historian S. V. Bachrushin, and he published his first research paper on the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries' [[landowner|landholding]] practices in the [[Novgorod Republic]].<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Salsburg |title=The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century |location=New York |publisher=W.

(Both were later involved in the political persecution of their common teacher [[Nikolai Luzin]], in the so-called [[Luzin affair]] in 1936.)<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF03024600| title = Who discovered analytic sets?| year = 2001| last1 = Lorentz | first1 = G.

Also in 1925, he published his work in [[intuitionistic logic]] — ''On the principle of the excluded middle'', in which he proved that under a certain interpretation, all statements of classical formal logic can be formulated as those of intuitionistic logic. In 1929, Kolmogorov earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) degree, from the [[Moscow State University]].\n\nIn 1930, Kolmogorov went on his first long trip abroad, traveling to [[Göttingen, Germany|Göttingen]] and [[Munich, Germany|Munich]], and then to [[Paris, France|Paris]]. He had various scientific contacts in Göttingen. First of all with [[Richard Courant|Courant]] and his students working on limit theorems, where diffusion processes turned out to be the limits of discrete random processes, then with [[Hermann Weyl|H. Weyl]] in intuitionistic logic, and lastly with [[Edmund Landau|Landau]] in function theory. His pioneering work, ''About the Analytical Methods of Probability Theory,'' was published (in German) in 1931. Also in 1931, he became a professor at the [[Moscow State University]].\n\nIn 1933, Kolmogorov published his book, ''Foundations of the Theory of Probability'', laying the modern axiomatic [[probability axioms|foundations of probability theory]] and establishing his reputation as the world's leading expert in this field. In 1935, Kolmogorov became the first chairman of the department of probability theory at the Moscow State University. Around the same years (1936) Kolmogorov contributed to the field of ecology and generalized the [[Lotka–Volterra]] model of [[predator-prey]] systems. In a 1938 paper, Kolmogorov \"established the basic theorems for smoothing and predicting stationary [[stochastic processes]]\"—a paper that would have major military applications during the [[Cold War]].<ref>Salsburg, p. 139.</ref> In 1939, he was elected a full member (academician) of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]] Kolmogorov contributed to the Soviet war effort by applying statistical theory to artillery fire, developing a scheme of stochastic distribution of barrage balloons intended to help protect [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow from German bombers]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|title=The Information: a history, a theory, a flood|date=2012|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-9623-7|page=334}}</ref>\n\nIn his study of [[stochastic processes]] (random processes), especially [[Markov process]]es, Kolmogorov and the British [[mathematician]] [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] independently developed the pivotal set of equations in the field, which have been given the name of the [[Chapman–Kolmogorov equation]]s.\n\n[[File:Kolm complexity lect.jpg|thumb|Kolmogorov (left) delivers a talk at a Soviet information theory symposium. ([[Tallinn]], 1973).]]\n[[File:Kolm lect prep.jpg|thumb|Kolmogorov works on his talk ([[Tallinn]], 1973).]]\n\nLater, Kolmogorov focused his research on [[turbulence]], where his publications (beginning in 1941) significantly influenced the field. In [[classical mechanics]], he is best known for the [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem]], first presented in 1954 at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]. In 1957, working jointly with his student [[V. I. Arnold]], he solved a particular interpretation of [[Hilbert's thirteenth problem]]. Around this time he also began to develop, and was considered a founder of, [[algorithmic complexity theory]] – often referred to as [[Kolmogorov complexity|Kolmogorov complexity theory]].\n\nKolmogorov married Anna Dmitrievna Egorova in 1942. He pursued a vigorous teaching routine throughout his life, not only at the university level but also with younger children, as he was actively involved in developing a pedagogy for gifted children (in literature, music, and mathematics). At the Moscow State University, Kolmogorov occupied different positions, including the heads of several departments: [[probability]], [[statistics]], and [[random process]]es; [[mathematical logic]]. He also served as the Dean of the Moscow State University Department of Mechanics and Mathematics.\n\nIn 1971, Kolmogorov joined an [[oceanographic]] expedition aboard the research vessel '''''[[Dmitri Mendeleev]]'''''. He wrote a number of articles for the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]].'' In his later years, he devoted much of his effort to the mathematical and philosophical relationship between [[probability theory]] in abstract and applied areas.<ref>Salsburg, pp. 145–7.</ref>\n\nKolmogorov died in Moscow in 1987, and his remains were buried in the [[Novodevichy cemetery]].\n\nA quotation attributed to Kolmogorov is [translated into English]: \"Every mathematician believes that he is ahead of the others. The reason none state this belief in public is because they are intelligent people.\"\n\nVladimir Arnold once has said: \"Kolmogorov – Poincaré – Gauss – Euler – Newton, are only five lives separating us from the source of our science\".\n\n==Awards and honours==\nKolmogorov received numerous awards and honours both during and after his lifetime:\n\n* Member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]<ref name=ussr/>\n* Awarded the  [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1941\n* Award the  [[Balzan Prize]] in 1962\n* Elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001334 |title=A.N.
