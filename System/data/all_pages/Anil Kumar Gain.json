He received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Cambridge]] under the supervision of [[Henry Ellis Daniels]], who was the then President of the [[Royal Statistical Society]]. He was honoured as a [[Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society]] and the famous [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Founder of the University|url=http://vidyasagar.ac.in/About/AKGayen.aspx|website=Vidyasagar University}}</ref>\n\nGain was the President of the Statistics section of the [[Indian Science Congress Association]], as well as the Head of the Department of Mathematics at the [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur|Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur]]. He later went on to found [[Vidyasagar University]], naming it after the famous social reformer of the [[Bengali renaissance]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Deceased Fellow|url=http://insaindia.org/deceaseddetail.php?id=N660257|website=Indian National Science Academy}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nAnil Kumar Gain was born in a poor [[Bengali people|Bengali]] family of a village named Lakkhi in [[Purba Medinipur district|Purba Medinipur]], [[West Bengal]], to Jibankrishna Gain and Panchami Devi. His father having died in his childhood, he and his siblings were brought up by his widowed mother under economic hardship. He started his education in an informal village school or ''Pathshala'' and was admitted to a formal school when he was eight. In his schooldays, he showed particular interest in [[English language|English]] and [[Mathematics]], subjects he was primarily taught by his mother. Upon finishing school, he travelled to [[Kolkata]] to complete an Honours degree in Mathematics from [[Surendranath College]], followed by a Master's degree in [[Applied mathematics]] from the [[University of Calcutta]]. He was declared the University Gold Medalist for the year 1943.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Guha|first1=Abhijit|title=Forgotten Founder of a University|url=http://www.frontierweekly.com/articles/vol-45/45-9/45-9-A%20Forgotten%20Founder%20of%20a%20University.html|website=Frontier Weekly|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:R. A. Fischer.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Sir [[Ronald Fisher]]]]\nAfter briefly teaching at [[Presidency College, Calcutta|Presidency College]] and [[Bengal College of Engineering & Technology]], Gain got married to Krishna Chongdar, daughter of a famous and wealthy businessman. He travelled to [[England]] in 1947, to pursue his Ph.D. from the [[University of Cambridge]] in [[Mathematical statistics]] – only to complete it in the year 1950. It was there that he met the famous [[Henry Ellis Daniels]], under whose supervision he wrote most of his papers. He also befriended [[Sir Ronald Fisher]] there, and spent much of his time working with him in the field of [[Applied statistics]], particularly on the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]].\n\nAfter returning to India, he started teaching at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]] as well as the [[University of Calcutta]], and finally joined the [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]], where he spent most of his remaining career. During his years at Kharagpur, he began to work on educational projects such as the [[NCERT|National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT)]] to reform the education sector in Bengal. This interest in revolutionizing education eventually led to the inception of [[Vidyasagar University]], which he founded with the vision of having a non-traditional teaching and learning environment at the University level. The University was finally established by the [[University Grants Commission (India)]] under the Vidyasagar University Act of 1981.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Guha|first1=Abhijit|title=Forgotten Founder of a University|url=http://www.frontierweekly.com/articles/vol-45/45-9/45-9-A%20Forgotten%20Founder%20of%20a%20University.html|website=Frontier Weekly|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy and Death==\n[[File:Vidyasagar University logo.jpg|thumbnail|left|Vidyasagar University Logo]]\nDue to his efforts to revolutionise education in Bengal, he became a key figure in the latter half of the [[Bengali renaissance]], as well as a renowned scholar and academic. In 2012, Vidyasagar announced the establishment of the ''Anil Kumar Gain Memorial Lecture'', in honour of his contributions to the university, and to Bengal as a whole.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Guha|first1=Abhijit|title=Foundation of Vidyasagar University|journal=Academia.edu|url=http://www.academia.edu/7375855/Vidyasagar_viswavidyalayer_bismrita_prothistata}}</ref>\n\nHe died a week after his birthday, on the 7th of February 1978, of natural causes at his residence in Kolkata, India. His descendants still live in Kolkata, as well as abroad.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Vidyasagar University]]\n* [[Christianity in West Bengal|Prominent Bengali Christians]]\n* [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]]\n* [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]]\n* [[Indian Science Congress Association]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Gain, Anil Kumar\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Indian scholar, Fellow of the Royal Society\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1 February 1919\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Purba Medinipur district|Purba Medinipur]], [[Bengal]], [[British India]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 7 February 1978\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Kolkata]], [[India]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gain, Anil Kumar}}\n[[Category:1919 births]]\n[[Category:1978 deaths]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Statistical Society]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge]]\n[[Category:People from Kolkata]]\n[[Category:Surendranath College alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Calcutta alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Calcutta faculty]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Bengali people]]\n[[Category:Indian people]]\n[[Category:Indian economists]]\n[[Category:Indian academics]]\n[[Category:Indian scientists]]\n[[Category:Indian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:People associated with the Bengal Renaissance]]\n[[Category:Indian educationists]]\n[[Category:Indian educators]]\n[[Category:Founders of Indian schools and colleges]]\n[[Category:Academics of the University of Cambridge]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Anil Kumar Gain"}}}}
