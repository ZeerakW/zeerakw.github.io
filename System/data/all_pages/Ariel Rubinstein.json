He is a professor of economics at the School of Economics at [[Tel Aviv University]] and the Department of Economics at [[New York University]].\n\nIn 1982, he published \"Perfect equilibrium in a bargaining model\",<ref name=Rubinstein1982>{{cite journal\n | author = Rubinstein, Ariel\n | year = 1982\n | title = Perfect Equilibrium in a Bargaining Model\n | journal = [[Econometrica]]\n | volume = 50\n | issue = 1\n | pages = 97–109\n | doi = 10.2307/1912531\n | url = http://arielrubinstein.tau.ac.il/papers/11.pdf\n | jstor = 1912531\n}}</ref> an important contribution to the theory of [[bargaining]].  The model is known also as a [[Rubinstein bargaining model]]. It describes two-person bargaining as an extensive game with [[perfect information]] in which the players alternate offers.  A key assumption is that the players are impatient. The main result gives conditions under which the game has a unique [[subgame perfect equilibrium]] and characterizes this equilibrium. He also co-wrote ''A Course in Game Theory'' (1994) with Martin J. Osborne, a textbook that has been cited in excess of 5,300 times as of March 2014.<ref>http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sCccieYAAAAJ&hl=en</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\nRubinstein was elected a member of the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] (1995),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.academy.ac.il/|title=Prof. Rubinstein Ariel Member Information (Election year 1995)|publisher=Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in (1994)<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter R|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=3 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110613085847/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf| archivedate= 13 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and the [[American Economic Association]] (1995).
