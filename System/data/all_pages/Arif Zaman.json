Before joining [[Lahore University of Management Sciences|LUMS]] in 1994, he also served Statistics Department at [[Purdue University]] and [[Florida State University]] .\n\nZaman attended the [[Harvey Mudd College]] where he completed his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in Mathematics in 1976.<ref name=\"Arif Zaman , Professor of Mathematics and Statistics\">{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Arif Zaman|url=http://web.lums.edu.pk/~arifz/resume.html|publisher=Arif Zaman , Professor of Mathematics and Statistics|accessdate=28 June 2010 | date=19 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100528131158/http://web.lums.edu.pk/~arifz/resume.html| archivedate= 28 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He completed his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] [[Applied Mathematics]] in 1977, and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] [[Statistics]] from [[Stanford University]] in 1981.<ref name=\"Arif Zaman , Professor of Mathematics and Statistics\"/> In his doctoral thesis he studied [[de Finetti's theorem]] and its possible turn out in [[Markov chain]]. His dissertation was supervised by [[Persi Diaconis]].\n\nZaman's recent research has been in the field of [[pseudo-random number]] generation which is now widely used in modern computing needs. He has also published papers on generalisations of [[Markov chains]], and on using computers to solve various theoretical problems in [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]]. His publications have been in various journals including: The Annals of Probability, Mathematics of Computation, Journal of Applied Probability, and Journal of Statistical Computation.\n\nIn his student years at Stanford, he was also rumored to be one of the two people involved in creating one of the first rabbit worms that replicated themselves over the local network.\n\n==Works==\n*Arif Zaman (1984), \"[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2243607 An Approximation Theorem for Finite Markov Exchangeability]\", ''[[Annals of Applied Probability]]'', volume 4, page 223â€“229.\n*Random Binary Matrices in Bio-ecological Ecology - Instituting a Good Neighbor Policy, Environmental and Ecological Statistics, 9, No. 4, 405-421, 2002, (with D.
