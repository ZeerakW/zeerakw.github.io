He and his father-in-law, [[Sir Michael Sobell]], entered ownership in 1957 and were immediately successful when purchasing [[London Cry]], who won the 1958 [[Cambridgeshire Handicap]]. In 1960 they purchased the [[Ballymacoll Stud]] in Ireland from the estate of [[Dorothy Paget]]. Although they had many winners their first really good racehorse was a colt called [[Reform (horse)|Reform]], who was the champion miler of 1967 and won amongst other races the [[St. James's Palace Stakes]] Sussex Stakes and [[Champion Stakes]]. Up until 1971 his horses were trained by [[Sir Gordon Richards]] but in 1970 with his father in law he purchased the West Ilsley stables from [[Jakie Astor]], whereupon [[Dick Hern]] became his trainer. They had almost immediate success with two good Ballymacoll bred two-year-olds, and subsequent three-year-old milers, in [[Sallust(horse)|Sallust]] and [[Sun Prince]]. They also owned and bred the [[St Leger Stakes]] runner-up Homeric. In 1974 [[Gaily]], a purchased filly, won the [[Irish One Thousand Guineas]]. Their next good horse was Admetus who won the Washington International Stakes and the [[Prince of Wales's Stakes]]. A few years later they bred and owned Cistus who won the Lupe Stakes, [[Falmouth Stakes|Child Stakes]], [[Nassau Stakes]] and the [[Prix de l'Opera]]. They achieved every owner/breeders dream when [[Troy (horse)|Troy]] won the 200th [[Epsom Derby]] in 1979. In 1981 they sold the stables to [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]. \n\nTheir next outstanding horse was [[Sun Princess (horse)|Sun Princess]] who won both the Epsom Oaks and St Leger. She in turn bred for them the Champion Two Year Old of 1988 [[Prince of Dance]]. In 1990 they had another fine race filly in [[Hellenic (horse)|Hellenic]], whose finest day was her victory in the Yorkshire Oaks but who was also second in the St Leger. By now the partnership's horses were being trained by [[Sir Michael Stoute]], although Hern remained as a trainer up until 1997 and other trainers such as [[Ian Balding]], [[Peter Chapple-Hyam]] and [[Roger Charlton]] trained at various times for them. Upon Sir Michael Sobell's death Weinstock continued his racing activities, in partnership with his son Simon. Their next good horse was the 1995 Irish Two Thousand Guineas and Champion Stakes winner [[Spectrum]]. On the premature death of Simon Weinstock the racing activities were continued but soon after raced under the name of the Ballymacoll Stud. He also owned [[Pilsudski (horse)|Pilsudski]], whose wins included the 1996 [[Grosser Preis von Baden]] and [[Breeders' Cup Turf]] plus the 1997 [[Japan Cup]]; [[Golan (horse)|Golan]] (who won the [[Two Thousand Guineas Stakes]] and the [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]] after Weinstock's death) and [[Islington (horse)|Islington]] (who won the [[Musidora Stakes]], and after Weinstock's death won the Nassau Stakes, the [[Yorkshire Oaks]] (twice) and the [[Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf]]). Ballymacoll Stud continues as a stud owned by his family to this day. The Weinstock developed families of Reform (but also of Hellenic, Golan and Islington), Sun Prince (but also of Sun Princess and Spectrum), and Gaily (but also of Pilsudski) continue in the stud.\n\n==Arms==\n{{Infobox COA wide\n|image = \n|crest = Upon a Wreath Argent Or and Azure on a Mount Vert two Musical Pipes saltirewise Or between two Stakes entwined by Vines fructed proper and ensigned by a Crown Rayonny Gules\n|coronet = A [[Coronet|Coronet of a Baron]]\n|escutcheon = Dancetty Argent and Gules on each of three Piles two issuant in chief and one in base Azure a Sun in Splendour its straight rays each tipped with Flame Or\n|supporters = Dexter: a Male Griffin Azure beaked rayed and gorged with a Crown Tridenty and Forelegs Or; Sinister: a Horse Or gorged with a Wreath of Trefoils the stalks entwined Vert\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]] 2001\n*Hutchinson Encyclopedia of Britain 2001\n* [[Alex Brummer]], ''Weinstock: The Life and Times of Britain's Premier Industrialist'' (HarperCollinsBusiness, 1998).\n* [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article800242.ece ''Timesonline'' article on the Weinstock Fund, charitable foundation]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Weinstock, Arnold\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = English businessman\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 29 July 1924\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 23 July 2002\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weinstock, Arnold}}\n[[Category:1924 births]]\n[[Category:2002 deaths]]\n[[Category:English Jews]]\n[[Category:English people of Polish-Jewish descent]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics]]\n[[Category:Fellows of Peterhouse, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:British statisticians]]\n[[Category:British businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Jewish philanthropists]]\n[[Category:British racehorse owners and breeders]]\n[[Category:Owners of Epsom Derby winners]]\n[[Category:British philanthropists]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n[[Category:Officiers of the Légion d'honneur]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]\n[[Category:Crossbench life peers]]\n[[Category:Trustees of the British Museum]]\n[[Category:General Electric Company plc]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Arnold Weinstock"}}}}
