Zellner contributed pioneering work in the field of [[Bayesian analysis]] and [[econometric model]]ing.\n\nIn Bayesian analysis, Zellner not only provided many applications of it but also a new [[information theory|information-theoretic]] derivation of rules that are 100% efficient information processing rules—this class includes Bayes's theorem. In [[econometric modeling]], he, in association with {{ill|nl|Franz Palm}}, developed the structural time-series approach for constructing new models and for checking the adequacy of old models. In addition, he was involved in many important applied econometric and statistical studies.\n\nBorn in [[Brooklyn, New York]], to [[Ukrainian American|Ukrainian immigrant]] parents,<ref>{{cite web |last=Aybar |first= Pinar |url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/blogs/news/2010/08/in_memoriam_of_arnold_zellner.php |title=In Memoriam of Dr. Arnold Zellner |date=August 12, 2010 |publisher=College of Natural Resources, University of California, Berkeley }}</ref> Zellner earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in [[physics]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1949 and his [[Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], under supervision of [[George Kuznets]], in 1957. He holds honorary degrees from the [[Autonomous University of Madrid]] in Spain, the [[Universidade Técnica de Lisboa]] in [[Portugal]], the [[University of Kiel]] in [[Germany]], and the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam|Erasmus School of Economics]] at [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nHe was H.G.B. Alexander Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Economics and Statistics at the Graduate School of Business of the [[University of Chicago]]. He was the founder of the [[International Society for Bayesian Analysis]] and also served as [[List of presidents of the American Statistical Association|President]] of the [[American Statistical Association]] in 1991.\n\nHe died on August 11, 2010, in his home in [[Hyde Park, Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/news.php?asset_id=2064|title=Arnold Zellner, 1927–2010, a pioneer of modern econometrics |publisher=University of Chicago |date=August 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/arnold.zellner/more/ Arnold Zellner's webpage]\n*[http://korora.econ.yale.edu/et/interview/zellner.pdf ET Interviews: Professor Arnold Zellner] on the [http://korora.econ.yale.edu/et/ Econometric Theory] page.\n*[http://www.strategy2market.com/downloads/InterviewwithArnoldZellner.pdf ''An Interview with Arnold Zellner''] (2004), Kathy Morrison\n*{{MathGenealogy|id=148660 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Zellner, Arnold\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American economist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = January 2, 1927\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Brooklyn, New York, USA\n| DATE OF DEATH     = August 11, 2010\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = Chicago, Illinois, USA\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zellner, Arnold}}\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:2010 deaths]]\n[[Category:American people of Ukrainian descent]]\n[[Category:American academics]]\n[[Category:Econometricians]]\n[[Category:American economists]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:Bayesian statisticians]]\n[[Category:Bayesian econometricians]]\n\n{{US-economist-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Arnold Zellner"}}}}
