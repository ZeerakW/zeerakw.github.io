He served as Minister of State at the Treasury from 1979 to 1982, as [[Secretary of State for Trade]] from 1982 until 1983, as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] from 1983 until 1984, and as a member of the [[European Commission]] from 1984 to 1988.\n\n==Early life==\nCockfield was born in [[Horsham]], a month after his father, Lieutenant C.F. Cockfield, died at the [[Battle of the Somme]]. He was educated at [[Dover Grammar School for Boys|Dover Grammar School]], then read for an LLB and a BSc (Econ) at the [[London School of Economics]].\n\n==Career==\nCockfield joined the [[Inland Revenue]] in 1938, and was called to the [[barrister|bar]] at the [[Inner Temple]] in 1942. He progressed rapidly within the Inland Revenue, serving as Director of Statistics from 1945 to 1952 and as a Commissioner from 1951 to 1952, before joining [[Boots Group|Boots]] as its finance director. He was its managing director and chairman from 1961 to 1967. He was also a member of [[Selwyn Lloyd]]'s [[National Economic Development Council]] from 1962 to 1964.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nCockfield was known by his first name, Frank, for most of his life but hated it. When he married his first wife, Ruth Simonis, his granddaughter, Emma, recalls how he told her he wished to use his middle name instead: \"All my life I've been called Frank but I've hated it- you're to call me Arthur.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nCockfield left Boots to become an adviser to the Conservative politicians [[Iain Macleod]] on taxation and economic matters, and was president of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] from 1968 to 1969. Macleod died shortly after the Conservatives took power in 1970, but Cockfield went on to advise [[Anthony Barber]], Macleod's successor as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], until 1973. He then served as chairman of the [[Price Commission]] from 1973 to 1977, receiving a knighthood in 1973.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Political career===\nCockfield was created '''Baron Cockfield''', of Dover in the County of [[Kent]], in April 1978. On the election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] to office in May 1979, he became a [[Minister of State]] at [[HM Treasury|the Treasury]], a post he held until April 1982. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1982, and was the last [[Secretary of State for Trade]] from 1982, before it was merged with the [[Department of Industry]] in 1983.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nAfter the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], Cockfield became [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. In this role he had no specific departmental responsibilities, so he effectively became an advisor and a sort of one-man think-tank to the Prime Minister. Lord Cockfield resigned from the cabinet in September 1984 to join the [[European Commission]] as commissioner for Internal Market, Tax Law and Customs under [[Jacques Delors]], and a Vice-President of the first [[Delors Commission]]. He was expected to follow [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[eurosceptic]] line, but became a driving force in laying the groundwork for the creation of the [[Single European Market]] in 1992. Only a few months after he arrived in Brussels, he produced a mammoth white paper listing 300 barriers to trade, with a timetable for them to be abolished. He was not selected{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} to serve a second term, and was replaced by [[Leon Brittan]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nAfter leaving the Commission in 1988, Cockfield became a consultant for accountants [[KPMG|Peat, Marwick, McLintock]]. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the [[Order of Leopold II]] of Belgium in 1990, and honorary doctorates and fellowships from a number of British and American universities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n==Personal life==\nHe married twice. He married his first wife, Ruth Helen Simonis, in 1943, but they divorced in the early 1960s. They had two children: a daughter, Hilary Ann Cockfield, born June 1944; and a son, Roger Edmund Cockfield, born 21 November 1947. He had five grandchildren by his 1st wife; daughter Hilary had daughter Juliet and sons Christopher (Known as Kit) and Patrick Williams; Roger had two girls Catherine Rosemary, born 31 December 1977, (named after his wife's mother Catherine May Vineall, née Lambert) and Emma Anne Alexandra Cockfield born 5 July 1981. He later married choreographer [[Monica Mudie]], in 1970; she died in 1992. He was survived by his son Roger and daughter Hilary and five grandchildren from his first marriage.\n\nLord Cockfield is buried, along with his wife Monica, on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-2539266,00.html Obituary], ''[[The Times]]'', 10 January 2007\n* [http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1987377,00.html Obituary], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 January 2007\n* [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=33S50EZWYWIO1QFIQMGCFFOAVCBQUIV0?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/news/2007/01/11/db1102.xml Obituary], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 11 January 2007\n* [http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2169226.ece Obituary], ''[[The Independent]]'', 22 January 2007\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[John Biffen]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Secretary of State for Trade]]|years=1982–1983}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Cecil Parkinson]]|as=Secretary of State for Trade and Industry}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Cecil Parkinson]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]|years=1983–1984}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Grey Ruthven, 2nd Earl of Gowrie|The Earl of Gowrie]]}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Christopher Tugendhat, Baron Tugendhat|Christopher Tugendhat]]}}\n{{s-ttl|rows=2|title=[[List of European Commissioners by nationality#United Kingdom|European Commissioner from the United Kingdom]]|years=1985–1989|alongside=[[Stanley Clinton Davis, Baron Clinton-Davis|Stanley Clinton-Davis]]}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Leon Brittan]]}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Ivor Richard]]}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Bruce Millan]]}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Karl-Heinz Narjes]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services]]|years=1985–1989}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Martin Bangemann]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Presidents of the Board of Trade}}\n{{European Commissioners from the United Kingdom}}\n{{Royal Statistical Society presidents}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n<!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n{{Persondata\n|NAME= Cockfield, Francis Arthur, Baron Cockfield\n|ALTERNATIVE NAMES=\n|SHORT DESCRIPTION=British politician and [[life peer]]\n|DATE OF BIRTH=28 September 1916\n|PLACE OF BIRTH=[[Horsham]], Sussex, United Kingdom\n|DATE OF DEATH=8 January 2007\n|PLACE OF DEATH=[[Oxford]], Oxfordshire, United Kingdom\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cockfield, Arthur}}\n[[Category:1916 births]]\n[[Category:2007 deaths]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics]]\n[[Category:Chancellors of the Duchy of Lancaster]]\n[[Category:Civil servants in the Board of Inland Revenue]]\n[[Category:Conservative Party (UK) life peers]]\n[[Category:British European Commissioners]]\n[[Category:British Secretaries of State]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n[[Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Leopold II]]\n[[Category:People from Dover, Kent]]\n[[Category:People from Horsham]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Royal Statistical Society]]\n[[Category:People educated at Dover Grammar School for Boys]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Arthur Cockfield, Baron Cockfield"}}}}
