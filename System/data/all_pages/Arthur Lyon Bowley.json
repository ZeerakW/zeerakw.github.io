He died in 1870 when Arthur was under two, leaving Arthur's mother as mother or stepmother to seven children. Arthur was educated at a [[Christ's Hospital]], and won a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] to study mathematics. He graduated as Tenth [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]].<ref>{{acad|id=BWLY887AL|name=Bowley, Arthur Lyon}}</ref>\n\nAt Cambridge Bowley had a short course of study with the economist [[Alfred Marshall]] who had also been a Cambridge wrangler.{{huh|date=August 2014}} Under Marshall's influence Bowley became an economic statistician. His ''Account of England's Foreign Trade'' won the [[Cobden Essay Prize]] and was published as a book. Marshall watched over Bowley's career, recommending him for jobs and offering him advice. Most notoriously Marshall told him the ''Elements of Statistics'' contained \"too much mathematics.\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Darnell|1981}}, p.&nbsp;141.</ref>\n\n==Academic career==\nAfter leaving Cambridge Bowley taught mathematics at [[St. John's School, Leatherhead|St John's School]] in [[Leatherhead]] from 1893 to 1899. Meanwhile, he was publishing in economic statistics; his first article for the journal of the [[Royal Statistical Society]]) appeared in 1895. In that year the [[London School of Economics]] opened. Bowley was appointed as a part-time lecturer and he would be connected with the School until he retired in 1936. He can be considered one of the School's intellectual fathers. However, he continued to teach elsewhere; for more than a decade he taught at University College, Reading (now the [[University of Reading]]). He was the [[William Newmarch|Newmarch]] lecturer at University College, London (1897–98 and 1927–28). At the LSE he became [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in 1908, and Professor in 1915. In 1919 he was appointed to a newly established [[Chair of Statistics]], probably the first of its kind in Britain. In Bowley's time, however, the LSE statistics group was very small: [[E. C. Rhodes]] arrived in 1924<ref>Grebenik, E. (1965) Edmund Cecil Rhodes, 1892–1964 (obituary). Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A '''128'''(4):615–616.</ref> and [[R. G. D. Allen]] in 1928.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199541454.001.0001/acref-9780199541454-e-1790 |contribution=Allen, Sir Roy George Douglas (1906–83)|author=Graham Upton and Ian Cook|edition=2nd|title=A Dictionary of Statistics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008}}.</ref>\n\nBowley produced a stream of studies of British economic statistics, beginning in the 1890s with work on trade and on wages and income, and proceeding to studies of [[national income]] in the 1920s and&nbsp;–30s. Specially noteworthy was his collaboration with [[Josiah Stamp, 1st Baron Stamp|Josiah Stamp]] on a comparison of the UK national income in 1911 and 1924. (Official national income statistics date only from the Second World War.) From around 1910 Bowley worked on social statistics as well. In aim, the work was a continuation of such surveys of social conditions as [[Rt Hon Charles Booth|Charles Booth's]] \"Life and Labour of the People in London\" (1889–1903) and [[Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree|Seebohm Rowntree's]] \"Poverty, A Study of Town Life\" (1901). The methodological innovation was the use of sampling techniques. Bowley gave a detailed exposition of his approach to sampling in a 62-page paper published in 1926. The culmination of Bowley's work on social surveys was the monumental ''New Survey of London Life and Labour.'' Even in the 1930s his research could take a new direction, as when he collaborated with his junior colleague [[R. G. D. Allen]] on an econometric study of family expenditure.<ref>{{harvtxt|Darnell|1981}}, p.&nbsp;159: \"Bowley's major contribution to econometrics was the path-breaking text ''Family Expenditure'' (1935) which he wrote in collaboration with R. G. D. Allen\".</ref>\n\n==Books==\nBowley's \"Elements of Statistics\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sanger, C. P.|title=Review: ''Elements of Statistics'' by A. L. Bowley|journal=The Economic Journal|date=June 1901|volume=11|issue=42|pages=193–197|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2957149|doi=10.2307/2957149}}</ref> is generally regarded as the first English-language [[statistics text-book]]. It described the techniques of descriptive statistics that would be useful for economists and social sciences, and in the early editions contained little statistical theory.\n\nIn statistical theory Bowley was not an innovator but drew on the writings of [[Karl Pearson]], [[Udny Yule]] and [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth|F. Y. Edgeworth]]. In the 1930s Bowley informed [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]] that \"Professor Edgeworth had written a great deal on a kindred subject\" and slapping Neyman down with \"I am not at all sure that the 'confidence' [in confidence interval] is not a 'confidence trick.'\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Darnell|1981}}, p.&nbsp;165.</ref>\n\nBowley's teaching presaged several of the [[Exploratory data analysis|EDA]] ideas later popularised by [[John Tukey]], including [[stemplot]]s, decile [[boxplot]]s, the [[seven-figure summary]] and [[trimean]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nBowley's '\"The Mathematical Groundwork of Economics'\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Edgeworth, F.

One of its successes was to bring the [[Edgeworth box]] to the attention of economists generally. Bowley was so successful that this is often referred to as the \"Edgeworth-Bowley box\". He also introduced the concept of [[conjectural variation]] into the theory of oligopoly in this book.\n\n==Honours==\nBowley received many honours. In 1922 he became [[Fellow of the British Academy]] and in 1950 he was knighted. He served on the council of the [[Royal Economic Society]] and was president of the [[Econometric Society]] 1938-9. The [[Royal Statistical Society]] awarded him its [[Guy Medal]] in Gold in 1935 and he served as its president 1938–40.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rss.org.uk/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=486|title = Royal Statistical Society Presidents|publisher= Royal Statistical Society|accessdate = 6 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAccording to Allen and George, \"In personality Bowley was somewhat shy and retiring. He did not readily make friends and his close friendship with [[Edwin Cannan]] over many years was an almost unique experience.\" They recall an anecdote about an occasion when Bowley and Cannan were cycling with Edgeworth. When Edgeworth wanted to discuss a mathematical question Cannan said, \"Bowley, let us go a little faster, Edgeworth cannot talk mathematics at more than eight miles an hour.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nHis daughter [[Marian Bowley]] also had an academic career in economics.<ref>{{citation|title=Seasons of a Scholar: Some Personal Reflections of an International Business Economist|first=John H.|last=Dunning|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781848444973|page=58|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kneQxADTuS0C&pg=PA58|quote=Marian Bowley was as rigorous and demanding a scholar as I imagine her father – Sir Arthur Bowley, the father of economic statistics and Professor of Economics at University College Reading between 1907 and 1919 – must have been.}}</ref>\n\n==Bowley's law==\nBowley formulated [[Bowley's law]], which says that the proportion of [[GNP]] from labour is constant.\n\n==Main publications of A.
