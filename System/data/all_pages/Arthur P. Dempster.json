He was one of four faculty when the department was founded in 1957.<ref>{{cite LAF|id=n 88662525}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nDempster received his B.A. in mathematics and physics (1952) and M.A. in mathematics (1953), both from [[University of Toronto]]. He obtained his Ph.D. in mathematical statistics from [[Princeton University]] in 1956. His thesis, titled ''The two-sample multivariate problem in the degenerate case'', was written under the supervision of [[John Tukey]].\n\n==Academic works==\nAmong his contributions to statistics are the [[Dempster–Shafer theory]] and the [[expectation-maximization algorithm|EM algorithm]].\n===Selected publications===\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177698950|title=Upper and lower probabilities induced by a multivalued mapping|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics |year=1967 |first=A.

(1977). \"Maximum Likelihood from Incomplete Data via the EM Algorithm,\" ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'', B, vol. 39, no. 1, pp.&nbsp;1–38.\n: The authors collected a variety of maximum likelihood problems and methods of solving these problems that occurred in the literature. They found that all of these methods had some ideas in common and they named it the EM Algorithm, standing for \"Expectation, Maximization\".\n\n==Honors and awards==\nDempster was a [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition|Putnam Fellow]] in 1951. He was elected to [[American Statistical Association|ASA]] Fellow in 1964,<ref name=asa /> [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics|IMS]] Fellow in 1963,<ref name=ims /> and [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences|AAAS]] Fellow in 1997.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=15981}}\n* [http://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/arthur-p-dempster Homepage on Harvard University]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Dempster, Arthur P.\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1929\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dempster, Arthur P.}}\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Princeton University alumni]]\n[[Category:Harvard University faculty]]\n[[Category:Putnam Fellows]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1929 births]]\n[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]\n\n\n{{US-statistician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Arthur P.
