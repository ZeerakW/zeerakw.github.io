After submitting his thesis on [[regular polyhedra]] in 1909, he was promoted to assistant at the Technical University in 1911 and then associate professor in the University of Munich in 1920. The following year he was appointed associate professor in the University of Heidelberg, with a promotion to full professor in 1930. Between 1932 and 1933 he served as dean in the faculty of mathematics and natural sciences, but was forced from his university position as a result of [[Nazi policies]] against German Jews. He moved to the [[Netherlands]] in 1936 and from there emigrated to the United States in 1939. He was appointed lecturer and research fellow at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1940 with a promotion to assistant professor in 1943. In 1946 he became associate professor at the [[University of New Mexico]] and the following year moved to the [[Purdue University]] as full professor, where he remained until his retirement in 1957. In 1954 he was formally reinstated in the University of Heidelberg. A scholarship at Purdue University is named in his honor. His doctoral students include [[Theodore Seio Chihara|Theodore Chihara]].\n\n==Research==\nRosenthal's mathematical research was in [[geometry]], in particular the classification of regular polyhedra and [[Hilbert's axioms]]. He also made contributions in [[analysis]], including to [[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]]'s theory of measure. With the Swiss mathematician [[Michel Plancherel]], he made contributions in [[ergodic theory]] and [[dynamical systems]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hartogs–Rosenthal theorem]]\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/gcs-wrapper/?gcsurl=http%253A%252F%252Flocalhost%253A8086%252Fgcs%252Fgcs%253Faction%253Dpdf%2526metsFile%253DPPN37721857X_0063%2526divID%253Dlog10%2526pdftitlepage%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.digizeitschriften.de%25252Fdms%25252Fpdf-titlepage%25252F%25253FmetsFile%25253DPPN37721857X_0063%252526divID%25253Dlog10%2526targetFileName%253D_log10.pdf|title=Arthur Rosenthal|first=Otto|last=Haupt|authorlink=Otto Haupt|journal=Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung|volume= 63 |pages=89–96|year=1960}}, Obituary in German ([[German Mathematical Society]])\n*[http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/helios/fachinfo/www/math/homo-heid/rosenthal.htm Arthur Rosenthal], [[University of Heidelberg]]\n*{{MathGenealogy|id=16907|name=Artur Rosenthal}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Rosenthal, Arthur\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = German mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 24 February 1887\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 15 September 1959\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rosenthal, Arthur}}\n[[Category:Technische Universität München alumni]]\n[[Category:Purdue University faculty]]\n[[Category:Heidelberg University faculty]]\n[[Category:German mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Refugees in the United States]]\n[[Category:Jewish refugees]]\n[[Category:1887 births]]\n[[Category:1959 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:University of Michigan faculty]]\n\n\n{{Germany-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Arthur Rosenthal"}}}}
