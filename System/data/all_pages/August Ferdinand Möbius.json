He then enrolled at the University of Leipzig, where he studied astronomy under the mathematician and astronomer, [[Karl Mollweide]].<ref>[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Mobius.html August Ferdinand Möbius, The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]</ref> In 1813 he began to study astronomy under the mathematically inclined professor [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] at the [[University of Göttingen]] while Gauss was the director of the [[Göttingen Observatory]].  From there he went to study with Carl Gauss's instructor, [[Johann Pfaff]] at the [[University of Halle]], where he completed his doctoral thesis ''The occultation of fixed stars'' in 1815.<ref>[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Mobius.html August Ferdinand Möbius, The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]</ref> In 1816 he was appointed  as Extraordinary Professor to the \"chair of astronomy and higher mechanics\" at the University of Leipzig.<ref>[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Mobius.html August Ferdinand Möbius, The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]</ref> Möbius died in [[Leipzig]] in 1868 at the age of 77. His son [[Theodor Möbius|Theodor]] was a noted philologist.\n\n==Contributions==\nHe is best known for his discovery of the [[Möbius strip]], a [[non-orientable]] two-dimensional surface with only one side when [[Embedding|embedded]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. It was independently discovered by [[Johann Benedict Listing]] around the same time. The [[Möbius configuration]], formed by two mutually inscribed tetrahedra, is also named after him. Möbius was the first to introduce [[homogeneous coordinates]] into [[projective geometry]].\n\nMany mathematical concepts are named after him, including the [[Möbius plane]], the [[Möbius transformation]]s, important in projective geometry, and the [[Möbius transform]] of number theory.  His interest in [[number theory]] led to the important [[Möbius function]] μ(''n'') and the [[Möbius inversion formula]]. In Euclidean geometry, he systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.<ref>[[Howard Eves]], A Survey of Geometry (1963), p. 64\n(Revised edition 1972, Allyn & Bacon, ISBN 0-205-03226-5)</ref>\n\n==Collected works==\n* [https://archive.org/details/gesammeltewerkeh01mbuoft Gesammelte Werke  erster Band (v. 1)]  (Leipzig : S.
