Koopman was a student of [[George David Birkhoff]] and his initial work concentrated on [[dynamical system]]s and [[mathematical physics]].\n\nIn 1931/1932, Koopman and [[John von Neumann]] proposed a Hilbert space formulation of classical mechanics, known as the [[Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], he joined the Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG, later ORG) in [[Washington, D.C.]], directed by [[Philip M. Morse]], to work for the U.S. Navy.<ref name=\"in-memoriam\">[[Philip M. Morse]]: ''In memoriam: Bernard Osgood Koopman, 1900–1981'', Operations Research, Vol. 30, No. 3 (May - Jun., 1982), pp. viii+417-427.

O. Koopman and his colleagues in the Antisubmarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG).\" Cited from: Henry R. Richardson, ''Search theory'', Professional Paper 449, April 1986</ref> Their results remained classified ''Confidential'' for many years after the war; after 1955 Koopman set out to publish three articles on easily declassifiable portions of the work in the Journal of the [[Operations Research Society of America]]. He wrote down the results in detailed form in the book ''Search and Screening'' which was declassified in 1958.<ref>Laura H.

In 1948 he married Jane Bridgman, daughter of his Harvard professor of thermodynamics, [[Percy Williams Bridgman]], and they had three more daughters.<ref name=\"in-memoriam\"/>\n\nKoopman's mother, née Louise Osgood, was a first cousin of [[William Fogg Osgood]].<ref name=\"in-memoriam\"/>\n\n==Publications==\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Koopman | first1 = B.
