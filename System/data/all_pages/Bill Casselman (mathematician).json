He is closely connected to the [[Langlands program]] and has been involved in posting all of the work of [[Robert Langlands]] on the internet.<ref>[http://publications.ias.edu/rpl/ Institute for Advanced Study: The Work of Robert Langlands]</ref>\n\n==Work==\nCasselman did his undergraduate work at [[Harvard College]] where his advisor was [[Raoul Bott]] and received his Ph.D from [[Princeton University]] in 1966 where his advisor was [[Goro Shimura]].  He was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1974, 1983, and 2001.<ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/cass Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars: Casselman, William]</ref> He emigrated to Canada in 1971 and is now Professor Emeritus in \nmathematics  at the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].<ref>[https://www.directory.ubc.ca/index.cfm?d=83I%3E%3CR_%2A%23O-6OD8%21%243%2EW2%22I5RT%2C6H%24H%3A%3C%0A UBC Faculty & Administrative Directory: Dr William Casselman]</ref>\n\nCasselman specializes in [[representation theory]], [[automorphic forms]], [[geometric combinatorics]], and the structure of [[algebraic groups]].
