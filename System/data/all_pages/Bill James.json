Since 1977, James has written more than two dozen books devoted to baseball history and statistics. His approach, which he termed [[sabermetrics]] in reference to the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] (SABR),<ref>Steve Sullivan, State of the Art: The Actuarial Game of Baseball, http://www.contingencies.org/mayjun04/stat.pdf</ref> scientifically analyzes and studies baseball, often through the use of statistical data, in an attempt to determine why teams win and lose. His ''Baseball Abstract'' books in the 1980s are the modern predecessor to websites using sabermetrics such as [[Baseball Prospectus]] and Baseball Primer (now [[Baseball Think Factory]]).<ref>Lewis, M: ''Moneyball'' p. 235, Norton Press, 2004.</ref>\n\nIn 2006, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named him in the [[Time 100]] as one of the most influential people in the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1187260,00.html |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=April 30, 2006 |title=Bill James |accessdate=April 26, 2010 |first=John |last=Henry}}</ref> He is a Senior Advisor on Baseball Operations for the [[Boston Red Sox]]. In 2010, Bill James was inducted into the [[Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100806&content_id=13101452&vkey=news_nyy&fext=.jsp&c_id=nyy |title=Cashman among Irish HOF's 2010 class |author=Didier Morais |publisher=[[MLB.com]] |date=August 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nJames was born in [[Holton, Kansas]]; he never knew his mother, who died in 1954. His father was a janitor at a high school. After four years at the [[University of Kansas]] residing at Stephenson Scholarship hall, James joined the [[United States Army|Army]] in 1971. He was the last person in Kansas to be sent to fight in the [[Vietnam War]], although he never saw action there. Instead, he spent two years stationed in [[South Korea]], during which time he wrote to KU about taking his final class. He was told he actually had met all his graduation requirements, so he returned to Lawrence in 1973 with degrees in English and economics. He also finished an Education degree in 1975, likewise from the University of Kansas.<ref>http://topmlbprospects.net/bill-james-bio/</ref>\n\n==''The Bill James Baseball Abstract''s==\nAn aspiring writer and obsessive fan, James began writing baseball articles after leaving the [[United States Army]] in his mid-twenties.  Many of his first baseball writings came while he was doing night shifts as a security guard at the [[Stokely-Van Camp's]] pork and beans cannery.  Unlike most writers, his pieces did not recount games in epic terms or offer insights gleaned from interviews with players.  A typical James piece posed a question (''e.g.,'' \"Which pitchers and catchers allow runners to steal the most bases?\"), and then presented data and analysis written in a lively, insightful, and witty style that offered an answer.<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Bill |date=2010 |title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_New_Bill_James_Historical_Baseball_A.html?id=3uSbqUm8hSAC |location= |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |page= |isbn=9781439106938 |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nEditors considered James's pieces so unusual that few believed them suitable for their readers. In an effort to reach a wider audience, James self-published an annual book titled ''The Bill James Baseball Abstract'' beginning in 1977.  The first edition of the book presented 80 pages of in-depth statistics compiled from James's study of [[box score]]s from the preceding season and was offered for sale through a small advertisement in  ''[[The Sporting News]]''.\n\nOver the next three years James's work won respect, including a very favorable review by [[Daniel Okrent]] in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124493/index.htm |work=CNN |title=He Does It by the Numbers |date=May 25, 1981 |accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> New annual editions added essays on teams and players.  By 1982 sales had increased tenfold, and a media conglomerate agreed to publish and distribute future editions.\n\nWhile writers had published books about baseball statistics before (most notably [[Earnshaw Cook]]'s ''Percentage Baseball'', in the 1960s), few had ever reached a mass audience. Attempts to imitate James's work spawned a flood of books and articles that continues to this day.\n\n==Post-''Abstract''s work==\nIn 1988, James ceased writing the ''Abstract'', citing workload-related burnout and concern about the volume of statistics on the market.  He has continued to publish hardcover books about baseball history, which have sold well and received admiring reviews.  These books include three editions of ''The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract'' (1985, 1988, 2001, the last entitled ''The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.'')\n\nJames has also written several series of new annuals:\n* ''The Baseball Book'' (1990–1992) was a loosely organized collection of commentary, profiles, historical articles, and occasional pieces of research.  James' assistant [[Rob Neyer]] was responsible for much of the research, and wrote several short pieces.  Neyer went on to become a featured baseball columnist at [[ESPN]] and [[SB Nation]].\n* ''The Player Ratings Book'' (1993–95) offered statistics and 50-word profiles aimed at the [[fantasy baseball]] enthusiast.\n* [http://actasports.com/detail.html?&id=9780879463403 The Bill James Handbook] (2003–present) provides past-season statistics and next-season projections for Major League players and teams, and career data for all current Major League players.

Subscribers can read James' new, original writing and interact with one another —- as well as with James —- in a question-and-answer format. The web site also offers new \"profiles\" of teams and players full of facts and statistics that hope to one day map what James has termed \"the lost island of baseball statistics.\"\n\n==Innovations==\nAmong the statistical innovations attributable to James are:\n* [[Runs created]].  A statistic intended to quantify a player's contribution to runs scored, as well as a team's expected number of runs scored. Runs created is calculated from other offensive statistics. James's first version of it was: Runs Created = ([[Total bases]] * ([[Hit (baseball)|Hits]] + [[Walk (baseball)|Walks]]))/(Plate Appearances).  Applied to an entire team or league, the statistic correlates closely to that team's or league's actual runs scored. Since James first created the statistic, sabermetricians have refined it to make it more accurate, and it is now used in many different variations.\n* [[Range factor]].  A statistic that quantifies the defensive contribution of a player, calculated in its simplest form as RF = ([[Assist (baseball)|Assists]] + [[Putout|Put Outs]])/(Games Played).  The statistic is premised on the notion that the total number of outs that a player participates in is more relevant in evaluating his defensive play than the percentage of cleanly handled chances as calculated by the conventional statistic [[Fielding percentage]].\n* Defensive Efficiency Rating.  A statistic that shows the percentage of balls in play a defense turns into an out.  It is used to help determine a team's defensive ability. Calculated by: 1 – ((Opp. Hits + Reached on Error – Opp. Home runs) / (Plate appearances – Walks – Strikeouts – HitByPitch – Opp. Home runs)).\n* [[Win shares]].  A unifying statistic intended to allow the comparison of players at different positions, as well as players of different eras.  Win Shares incorporates a variety of pitching, hitting and fielding statistics.  One drawback of Win Shares is the difficulty of computing it.<ref name=\"tht-interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/bill-james-interview/ |title=Bill James Interview |work=[[The Hardball Times]] |last=Jaffe |first=Chris |date=February 4, 2008 |accessdate=February 16, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080207094539/http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/bill-james-interview/ |archivedate=February 7, 2008 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n* [[Pythagorean expectation|Pythagorean Winning Percentage]].  A statistic explaining the relationship of wins and losses to runs scored and runs allowed.  In its simplest form: Pythagorean Winning Percentage equals Runs squared divided by the square of Runs plus the square of Runs Allowed.  The statistic correlates closely to a team's actual winning percentage.\n* [[Game Score]] is a metric to determine the strength of a pitcher in any particular baseball game.\n* Major League Equivalency.  A metric that uses [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] statistics to predict how a player is likely to perform at the major league level.\n* The Brock2 System.  A system for projecting a player's performance over the remainder of his career based on past performance and the aging process.\n* [[Similarity score]]s. Scoring a player's statistical similarity to other players, providing a frame of reference for players of the distant past. Examples: [[Lou Gehrig]] comparable to [[Don Mattingly]]; [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|Joe Jackson]] to [[Tony Oliva]].\n* [[Secondary average]]. A statistic that attempts to measure a player's contribution to an offense in ways not reflected in batting average. The formula is (Extra bases on hits+Walks+Stolen Bases)/At bats. Secondary averages tend to be similar to batting averages, but can vary widely, from less than .100 to more than .500 in extreme cases. Extra bases on hits is calculated with the formula (Doubles)+(Triplesx2)+(Homerunsx3) or more easily, (Total Bases)-(Hits).\n* [[Power/Speed Number]]. A statistic that attempts to consolidate the various \"clubs\" of players with impressive numbers of both home runs and stolen bases (e.g., the \"30/30\" club (Bobby Bonds was well known for being a member), the \"40/40\" club (José Canseco was the first to perform this feat), and even the \"25/65\" club (Joe Morgan in the '70s)). The formula: (2x(Home Runs)x(Stolen Bases))/(Home Runs + Stolen Bases).\n* Approximate Value.  A system of cutoffs designed to estimate the value a player contributed to various category groups (including his team) to study broad questions such as \"how do players age over time\".\n* \"Temperature gauge\" to determine how \"hot\" a player is, based on recent performance.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nesn.com/2011/08/bill-james-explains-new-temperature-gauge-statistic-to-determine-how-hot-or-cold-a-hitter-is.html |work=NESN |title=Bill James Explains New 'Temperature Gauge' Statistic to Determine How Hot or Cold a Hitter Is |date=May 7, 2012 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref> The gauge has been used in [[NESN]] Red Sox telecasts and has provoked mixed reactions from critics.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsofboston.com/2011/09/22/movie-review-moneyball-starring-brad-pitt-and-jonah-hill/ |work=Sports of Boston |title=Movie Review: \"Moneyball,\" starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlthough James may be best known as an inventor of statistical tools, he has often written on the limitations of statistics and urged humility concerning their place amid other kinds of information about baseball.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/sportsnation/chat/_/id/3503 |title=SportsNation:Chat with Bill James |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=May 22, 2014}}</ref> To James, context is paramount: he was among the first to emphasize the importance of adjusting traditional statistics for [[Batting Park Factor|park factors]] and to stress the role of luck in a pitcher's win-loss record.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/baseball/flb/story?page=mlbdk2k10ballparks |title=Ranking The Ballparks |author=Tristan H.

When he introduced the notion of [[secondary average]], it was as a vehicle for the then-counterintuitive concept that [[batting average]] represents only a fraction of a player's offensive contribution. (The [[Runs Created|runs-created statistic]] plays a similar role vis-à-vis the traditional [[runs batted in|RBI]].) Some of his contributions to the language of baseball, like the idea of the \"[[defensive spectrum]]\", border on being entirely non-statistical.\n\n==STATS, Inc.==\nIn an essay published in the 1984 ''Abstract'', James vented his frustration about [[Major League Baseball]]'s refusal to publish play-by-play accounts of every game. James proposed the creation of Project Scoresheet, a network of fans that would work together to collect and distribute this information.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19840428&id=EaBSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=V30DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6795,3730203 |title=Top Secret: Project Scoresheet to bring hidden facts to the fans |author=Glenn Miller |publisher=[[Evening Independent]] |date=April 28, 1984}}</ref>\n\nWhile the resulting non-profit organization never functioned smoothly, it worked well enough to collect accounts of every game from 1984 through 1991. James's publisher agreed to distribute two annuals of essays and data – the 1987 and 1988 editions of ''[[Bill James Presents The Great American Baseball Statbook]]'' (though only the first of these featured writing by James).\n\nThe organization was eventually disbanded, but many of its members went on to form for-profit companies with similar goals and structure. [[STATS, Inc.]], the company James joined, provided data and analysis to every major media outlet before being acquired by [[Fox Network|Fox]] Sports in 2001.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140515/BLOGS04/140519841/stats-llc-sold-to-private-equity-firm |title=Stats LLC sold to private-equity firm |author=Danny Ecker |publisher=[[Crain's Chicago Business]] |date=May 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Acceptance and employment in mainstream baseball==\n[[Oakland Athletics]] general manager [[Billy Beane]] began applying sabermetric principles to running his low-budget team in the late 1990s, to notable effect, as chronicled in [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]]' book ''[[Moneyball]]''.\n\nIn 2003, James was hired by a former reader, [[John Henry (baseball)|John Henry]], the new owner of the [[Boston Red Sox]].\n\nOne point of controversy was in handling the relief pitching of the Red Sox.<ref>[[#prospectus2005|Baseball Prospectus 2005, pp.69–70]]</ref> James had previously published analysis of the use of the [[closer (baseball)|closer]] in baseball, and had concluded that the traditional use of the closer both overrated the abilities of that individual, and used him in suboptimal circumstances. He wrote that it is \"far better to use your [[relief ace]] when the score is tied, even if that is the seventh inning, than in the ninth inning with a lead of two or more runs.\"<ref>[[#prospectus2005|Baseball Prospectus 2005, p.66]]</ref> The Red Sox in 2003 staffed their bullpen with several marginally talented relievers.<ref name=prospectus2005_69>[[#prospectus2005|Baseball Prospectus 2005, p.69]]</ref> Red Sox manager [[Grady Little]] was never fully comfortable with the setup, and designated unofficial closers and reshuffled roles after a bad outing.

Indeed, although James is typically tight-lipped about his activities on behalf of the Red Sox, he is credited with advocating some of the moves that led to the team's first [[World Series]] championship in 86 years, including the signing of non-tendered free agent [[David Ortiz]], the trade for [[Mark Bellhorn]], and the team's increased emphasis on [[on-base percentage]].\n\nAfter the Red Sox suffered through [[2012 Boston Red Sox season|a disastrous 2012 season]], Henry stated that James had fallen \"out of favor [in the front office] over the last few years for reasons I really don't understand. We've gotten him more involved recently in the central process and that will help greatly.\"<ref>http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/09/05/bill-james-to-assume-a-more-prominent-role-in-the-red-sox-front-office/</ref>\n\nDuring his time with the Red Sox, Bill James has received three [[World Series ring]]s for the team's 2004, 2007, and 2013 victories.<ref name=\"tht-interview\" />\n\n==In culture==\nJames was profiled on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' on March 30, 2008, in his role as a sabermetric pioneer and Red Sox advisor.\n\n[[Michael Lewis]], in his book ''[[Moneyball]]'', dedicates a chapter to James' career and Sabermetrics as background for his portrayal of [[Billy Beane]] and the Oakland Athletics' unlikely success.\n\nJames made a guest appearance on the ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[MoneyBART]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nesn.com/2010/10/sabermetrician-bill-james-pokes-fun-at-himself-on-the-simpsons.html |title=Sabermetrician Bill James Pokes Fun at Himself on 'The Simpsons' |author=Hurley, Michael |publisher=[[NESN]] |date=October 11, 2010 |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Steven Soderbergh]]'s planned film adaptation of ''[[Moneyball]]'' would have featured an animated version of James as a \"host\".<ref>http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/05/06/exclusive-steven-soderbergh-to-use-animated-bill-james-character-in-moneyball/</ref>  This script was discarded when director [[Bennett Miller]] and writer [[Aaron Sorkin]] succeeded Soderbergh on the project.\n\nUltimately, [[Moneyball (film)|the film as produced]] mentions James several times. His unlikely bio is briefly recapped, and Billy Beane is depicted telling John Henry that Henry's hiring of James is the reason Beane is interested in the Red Sox general manager job.\n\n==Dowd Report controversy==\nIn his ''Baseball Book 1990'', James heavily criticized the methodology of the [[Dowd Report]], which was an investigation (commissioned by baseball commissioner [[Bart Giamatti]]) on the gambling activities of [[Pete Rose]].  James reproached commissioner Giamatti and his successor, Fay Vincent, for their acceptance of the Dowd Report as the final word on Rose's gambling. (James' attitude on the matter surprised many fans, especially after the writer had been deeply critical of Rose in the past, especially what James considered to be Rose's selfish pursuit of [[Ty Cobb]]'s all-time record for base hits.)\n\nJames expanded his defense of Rose in his 2001 book ''The New Historical Baseball Abstract'', with a detailed explanation of why he found the case against Rose flimsy. James wrote \"I would characterize the evidence that Rose bet on baseball as...well, not quite non-existent. It is extremely weak.\"  This countered the popular opinion that the case against Rose was a slam dunk, and several critics claimed that James misstated some of the evidence in his defense of Rose. [[Derek Zumsteg]] of [[Baseball Prospectus]] wrote an exhaustive review of the case James made and concluded: \"James' defense of Rose is filled with oversights, errors in judgment, failures in research, and is a great disservice to the many people who have looked to him for a balanced and fair take on this complicated and important issue.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20021031zumsteg.shtml |publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]] |date=October 31, 2002 |title=Evaluating the Dowd Report |first=Derek |last=Zumsteg}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Rose admitted publicly that he had bet on baseball and confirmed the Dowd Report was correct. James remained steadfast, continuing to insist that the evidence available to Dowd at the time was insufficient to reach the conclusion that it did.\n\n==Paterno controversy==\nOn November 4, 2011, [[Jerry Sandusky]] was indicted for committing sex crimes against young boys, which brought the [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal]] to national attention.  On December 11, 2011, James published an article called \"The Trial of Penn State\", depicting an imaginary trial in which Penn State defended itself against charges of \"acting rashly and irresponsibly in the matter of Joe Paterno, in such a manner that [they] defamed, libeled and slandered Paterno, unfairly demolishing his reputation.\"<ref>http://www.billjamesonline.com/the_trial_of_penn_state/?AuthorId=3&Month=12&Year=2011</ref>\n\nOn July 12, 2012, the [[Freeh report]] was released, charging Paterno and three other University officials with covering up reports of sexual assaults and enabling the attacker to prey on other children for more than a decade, often in Penn State facilities.  Soon afterwards, during an interview on ESPN radio, James claimed that the Freeh report's characterizations of Paterno as a powerful figure were wrong, and that it wasn't Paterno's responsibility to report allegations of child molestation to the police. \"[Paterno] had very few allies.
