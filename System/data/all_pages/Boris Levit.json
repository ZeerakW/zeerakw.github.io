Levit at the Mathematics Genealogy Project  |accessdate=2008-10-11 |year=2008 }}</ref> While at [[Moscow State University]], he was influenced by many famous mathematicians of the era, including [[Andrei Kolmogorov]].\n\nBefore undertaking a professorship at [[Queen's University]], Levit spent several years lecturing in the United States. He has also spent nearly ten years in the [[Netherlands]], as a professor of [[statistics]] at the [[University of Utrecht]].\n\nWell-known internationally, Levit has made outstanding contributions to the field of [[statistics]]. His research has included statistical problems involving infinitely many parameters, as well as [[nonparametric statistics]]. In the 1980s, he discovered how to characterize high order approximation problems using the properties of corresponding [[elliptic operator|elliptic differential operators]]. Levit was awarded a D.Sc. by [[Vilnius University]] for his use of [[differential geometry]] and [[partial differential equations]] in statistical research.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.mast.queensu.ca/~blevit Official site]\n*{{MathGenealogy|id=80043}}\n\n<!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n{{Persondata\n|NAME= Levit, Boris Ð¯.\n|ALTERNATIVE NAMES=\n|SHORT DESCRIPTION= [[Mathematics]], [[Statistics]]\n|DATE OF BIRTH=\n|PLACE OF BIRTH=\n|DATE OF DEATH=\n|PLACE OF DEATH=\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Levit, Boris}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Russian statisticians]]\n[[Category:Russian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Canadian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Moldovan mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Vilnius University alumni]]\n[[Category:Canadian statisticians]]\n[[Category:Queen's University faculty]]\n\n\n{{Russia-mathematician-stub}}\n{{Canada-scientist-stub}}\n{{statistician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Boris Levit"}}}}
