He arrived at [[Stanford]] in fall of 1960, earning his Ph.D., under the direction of Rupert Miller and Herb Solomon, in the Department of Statistics.  While at Stanford, he was suspended for a year for his involvement with the [[Stanford Chaparral]]'s parody of [[Playboy magazine]].<ref>{{cite web|\nurl = http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf0f59n4t0&chunk.id=bioghist-1.8.3&brand=oac|\ntitle = Guide to the Hammer and Coffin Society Records, 1906-1987|\npublisher = Online Archive of California}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|\nurl = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2010.00460.x/pdf|\ntitle = Bradley Efron|\npublisher = Significance, the bimonthly magazine and website of the Royal Statistical Society and the American Statistical Association}}</ref>\n\nHe is currently a Professor of Statistics and Biostatistics at Stanford. At Stanford he has been the Chair of the Department of Statistics, Associate Dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences, Chairman of the University Advisory Board, Chair of the Faculty Senate and Co-director of the undergraduate-level Mathematical & Computational Science Program.\n\nEfron holds the Max H. Stein endowed chair as Professor of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford.\n\nHe has made many important contributions to many areas of statistics. Efron's work has spanned both theoretical and applied topics, including empirical Bayes analysis (with [[Carl Morris (statistician)|Carl Morris]]), applications of [[differential geometry]] to [[statistical inference]], the analysis of survival data, and inference for microarray gene expression data.<ref>{{cite book|author = Bradley Efron|title = Large-Scale Inference: Empirical Bayes Methods for Estimation, Testing, and Prediction|publisher = Institute of Mathematical Statistics Monographs/Cambridge University Press|year = 2010|isbn=9780521192491}}</ref> He is the author of a classic monograph, ''The Jackknife, the Bootstrap and Other Resampling Plans'' (1982) and has also co-authored (with R. Tibshirani) the text ''An Introduction to the Bootstrap'' (1994).\n\nHe created a set of [[nontransitive dice]] called [[Efron's dice]].\n\n==Awards==\nHe has won many honors, including a [[MacArthur Prize Fellowship]], membership in the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], fellowship in the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]] (IMS) and the [[American Statistical Association]] (ASA), the [[Lester R.
