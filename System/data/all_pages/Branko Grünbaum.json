He received his Ph.D. in 1957 from [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in [[Israel]].<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{MathGenealogy|id=26965}}</ref>  \nHe has authored over 200 papers, mostly in [[discrete geometry]], an area in which he is particularly well known for various meticulous [[classification theorem]]s. He has been a key pioneer in the theory of [[abstract polyhedra]].\n\nHis paper on [[line arrangement]]s may have inspired a paper by [[N. G. de Bruijn]] on [[aperiodic tiling|quasiperiodic tilings]] (the most famous example of which is the [[Penrose tiling]] of the plane).  This paper is also cited by the authors of a monograph on hyperplane arrangements as having inspired their research.\n\nGrünbaum has also devised a multi-set generalisation of [[Venn diagram]]s.  He is an editor and a frequent contributor to ''[[Geombinatorics]]''.\n\nGrünbaum's classic monograph ''Convex polytopes'', first published in 1967, has become the main textbook on the subject.  His monograph ''Tilings and Patterns'', coauthored with G. C. Shephard, helped to rejuvenate interest in this classic field, and has proved popular with nonmathematical audiences, as well as with mathematicians.\n\nIn 1976 Grünbaum won a [[Lester R. Ford Award]] for his expository article ''Venn diagrams and independent families of sets''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Grünbaum, Branko|title=Venn diagrams and independent families of sets|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=48|year=1975|pages=12–23|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/venn-diagrams-and-independent-families-of-sets|doi=10.2307/2689288}}</ref> In 2004, [[Gil Kalai]] and [[Victor Klee]] edited a special issue of ''[[Discrete and Computational Geometry]]'' in his honor, the \"Grünbaum Festschrift\". In 2005, Grünbaum was awarded the [[Leroy P. Steele Prizes|Leroy P. Steele Prize]] for Mathematical Exposition from the [[American Mathematical Society]]. He is a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Gugenheim Fellow]], a [[Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science|Fellow of the AAAS]] and in 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-19.</ref><ref>{{cite article |author=M.
