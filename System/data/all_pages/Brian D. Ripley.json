From 1990, he was professor of [[applied statistics]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and is also a [[professorial fellow]] at [[St Peter's College, Oxford|St Peter's College]]. He retired August 2014 due to ill health.<ref>[http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~ripley/ Professor Ripley's Homepage at Oxford University]. Accessed 2015-05-10.</ref>\n\nRipley has made contributions to the fields of [[spatial statistics]] and [[pattern recognition]]. His work on [[artificial neural network]]s in the 1990s helped to bring aspects of [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]] to the attention of statistical audiences.<ref>For instance, his book ''Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks'' was reviewed in the [[Journal of the American Statistical Association]]: {{citation|title=Reviewed Works: ''Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition'' by C. M. Bishop; ''Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks'' by B. D. Ripley|first=Nicholas|last=Lange|journal=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]]|volume=92|issue=440|date=December 1997|pages=1642â€“1645|jstor=2965437}}.</ref> He emphasised the value of [[robust statistics]] in his books ''Modern Applied Statistics with S'' and ''Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks''.\n\nRipley helped develop the [[S programming language]] and its implementations: [[S-PLUS]] and [[R (programming language)|R]]. He co-authored two books based on S, ''Modern Applied Statistics with S'' and ''S Programming''.\n\nHe was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he was awarded both the [[Smith's Prize]] and the [[Rollo Davidson Prize]]. The university also awarded him the [[Adams Prize]] in 1987 for an essay entitled ''Statistical Inference for Spatial Processes'', later published as a book.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ripley|first=B. D.|title=Statistical Inference for Spatial Processes|year=1988|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-35234-7|pages=iv, vii}}</ref> He served on the faculty of [[Imperial College, London]] from 1976 until 1983, at which point he moved to the [[University of Strathclyde]].<ref>[http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~ripley/profile.html Profile of Professor Brian D Ripley] (Last edited 1 October 1999 by Brian Ripley).
