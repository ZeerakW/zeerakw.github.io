They are named after [[Henri Brocard]] (1845 &ndash; 1922), a French mathematician.\n\n==Definition==\nIn a triangle ''ABC'' with sides ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', where the vertices are labeled ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' in anticlockwise order, there is exactly one point ''P'' such that the line segments ''AP'', ''BP'', and ''CP'' form the same angle, ω, with the respective sides ''c'', ''a'', and ''b'', namely that\n\n: <math>\\angle PAB = \\angle PBC = \\angle PCA.\\,</math>\n\nPoint ''P'' is called the '''first Brocard point''' of the triangle ''ABC'', and the angle ''ω'' is called the '''Brocard angle''' of the triangle. The following applies to this angle:\n\n:<math>\\cot\\omega = \\cot \\alpha + \\cot \\beta + \\cot \\gamma.\\,</math>\n\nThere is also a '''second Brocard point''', Q, in triangle ''ABC'' such that line segments ''AQ'', ''BQ'', and ''CQ'' form equal angles with sides ''b'', ''c'', and ''a'' respectively.  In other words, the equations <math>\\angle QCB = \\angle QBA = \\angle QAC</math> apply. Remarkably, this second Brocard point has the same Brocard angle as the first Brocard point.  In other words angle <math>\\angle PBC = \\angle PCA = \\angle PAB</math> is the same as <math>\\angle QCB = \\angle QBA = \\angle QAC.</math>\n\nThe two Brocard points are closely related to one another; In fact, the difference between the first and the second depends on the order in which the angles of triangle ''ABC'' are taken. So for example, the first Brocard point of triangle ''ABC'' is the same as the second Brocard point of triangle ''ACB''.\n\nThe two Brocard points of a triangle ''ABC'' are [[isogonal conjugate]]s of each other.\n\n== Construction ==\nThe most elegant construction of the Brocard points goes as follows. In the following example the first Brocard point is presented, but the construction for the second Brocard point is very similar.\n\nForm a circle through points A and B, tangent to edge BC of the triangle (the center of this circle is at the point where the perpendicular bisector of AB meets the line through point B that is perpendicular to BC). Symmetrically, form a circle through points B and C, tangent to edge AC, and a circle through points A and C, tangent to edge AB. These three circles have a common point, the first Brocard point of triangle ''ABC''.  See also [[Tangent lines to circles]].\n\nThe three circles just constructed are also designated as '''epicycles''' of triangle ''ABC''. The second Brocard point is constructed in similar fashion.\n\n== Trilinears and the Brocard midpoint ==\nHomogeneous [[trilinear coordinates]] for the first and second Brocard points are ''c''/''b'' : ''a''/''c'' : ''b''/''a'', and ''b''/''c'' : ''c''/''a'' : ''a''/''b'', respectively.  The Brocard points are an example of a bicentric pair of points, but they are not [[triangle center]]s because neither Brocard point is invariant under [[similarity (geometry)|similarity transformations]]: reflecting a scalene triangle, a special case of a similarity, turns one Brocard point into the other.  However, the [[unordered pair]] formed by both points is invariant under similarities. The midpoint of the two Brocard points, called the '''Brocard midpoint''', has trilinears\n\n:sin(''A'' + ω) : sin(''B'' + ω) : sin(''C'' + ω)<ref>Entry X(39) in the [http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/encyclopedia/ETC.html#X39 Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers]</ref>\n\nand is a triangle center.
