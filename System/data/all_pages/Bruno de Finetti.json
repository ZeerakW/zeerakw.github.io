The classic exposition of his distinctive theory is the 1937 \"La prévision: ses lois logiques, ses sources subjectives,\"<ref>\"La prévision: ses lois logiques, ses sources subjectives,\" ''Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincaré'', 7, 1-68,</ref> which discussed probability founded on the coherence of betting odds and the consequences of [[exchangeability]].\n\n==Life==\nDe Finetti was born in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] and studied mathematics at [[Politecnico di Milano]]. He graduated in 1927 writing his thesis under the supervision of [[Giulio Vivanti]]. After graduation, he worked as an actuary and a statistician at ''Istituto Nazionale di Statistica'' ([[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|National Institute of Statistics]]) in Rome and, from 1931, the [[Trieste]] insurance company [[Assicurazioni Generali]].\n\nHe published extensively (17 papers in 1930 alone, according to Lindley) and acquired an international reputation in the small world of probability mathematicians. He taught mathematical analysis in Padua and then won a chair in Financial Mathematics at [[Trieste University]] (1939). In 1954 he moved to the [[Sapienza University of Rome]], first to another chair in Financial Mathematics and then, from 1961 to 1976, one in the Calculus of Probabilities. De Finetti developed his ideas on subjective probability in the 1920s independently of [[Frank P. Ramsey]]. Still, according to the preface of his Theory of Probability, he drew on ideas of [[Harold Jeffreys]], [[I. J. Good]] and [[Bernard Koopman|B.O. Koopman]]. He only became known in the Anglo-American statistical world in the 1950s when [[L. J. Savage]], who had independently adopted [[Bayesian inference|subjectivism]], drew him into it; another great champion was [[Dennis Lindley]]. De Finetti died in [[Rome]].\n\n==Work==\nDe Finetti emphasized a [[predictive inference]] approach to statistics;\nhe proposed a [[thought experiment]] along the following lines (described in greater detail at [[coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)]]): ''You'' must set the price of a promise to pay $1 if there was life on Mars 1 billion years ago, and $0 if there was not, and tomorrow the answer will be revealed.  You know that ''your opponent'' will be able to choose either to buy such a promise from you at the price you have set, or require you to buy such a promise from your opponent, still at the same price.  In other words: you set the odds, but your opponent decides which side of the bet will be yours.  The price you set is the \"operational subjective probability\" that you assign to the proposition on which you are betting. This price has to obey the probability axioms if you are not to face certain loss, as you would if you set a price above $1 (or a negative price). By considering bets on more than one event de Finetti could justify additivity. Prices, or equivalently [[odds]], that do not expose you to certain loss through a ''[[Dutch book]]'' are called ''coherent''.\n\nDe Finetti is also noted for [[de Finetti's theorem]] on [[de Finetti's theorem|exchangeable]] sequences of [[random variable]]s.  De Finetti was not the first to study exchangeability but he brought the subject to greater visibility. He started publishing on exchangeability in the late 1920s but the 1937 article is his most famous treatment.\n\nIn 1929, de Finetti introduced the concept of [[infinitely divisible probability distribution]]s.\n\nHe also introduced [[de Finetti diagram]]s for graphing [[genotype]] frequencies.\n\nThe 1974 English translation of his book is credited with reviving interest in predictive inference in the Anglophone world, and bringing the idea of exchangeability to its attention.<ref name=\"geisser\">''[http://books.google.com/books?id=wfdlBZ_iwZoC Predictive Inference: An Introduction]'', [[Seymour Geisser]], [[CRC Press]], 1993 ISBN 0-412-03471-9</ref>\n\nThe de Finetti Award, presented annually by the [[European Association for Decision Making]], is named after him.\n\n==Bibliography==\nSee Works on \n*[http://www.brunodefinetti.it/ Bruno de Finetti website]\n\n=== de Finetti in English===\n(The following are translations of works originally published in Italian or French.)\n*\"Probabilism: A Critical Essay on the Theory of Probability and on the Value of Science,\" (translation of 1931 article) in ''Erkenntnis,'' volume 31, September 1989.
