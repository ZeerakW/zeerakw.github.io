Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Mt. Lebanon]], [[United States]]) was a respectable [[Americans|American]] [[population genetics|population geneticist]] and [[human genetics|human geneticist]]. Li was best known for his book ''An Introduction to Population Genetics'' and his teaching in human genetics.\n\n== Biography ==\nChing Chun Li was born on October 27, 1912, in Taku, Tianjin, China. He received his [[B.S.]] degree in [[agronomy]] from the [[University of Nanking]] in 1936 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in plant breeding and genetics from [[Cornell University]] in 1940. He worked as post-doctorate fellows at [[Columbia University]] and [[North Carolina State University]] from 1940 to 1941.\n\nLi returned to China at the age of 30 and became the Professor of [[Genetics]] and [[Biometry]] at University of Nanking, his [[alma mater]], in 1943. After [[World War II]], he moved to [[Beijing]] for a Professorship of Agronomy at [[Peking University]] in 1946, where he finished ''An Introduction to Population Genetics'' in 1948. The book was the first notable publication where a combination of the ideas of [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Sewall Wright]], and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] about population genetics was brought to and made understandable to the academia.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1181974/ Ching Chun Li (1912–2003):A Personal Remembrance of a Hero of Genetics] A.
