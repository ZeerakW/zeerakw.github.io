His parents were Emmerich Emanuel and Aurora Kristina (née Hollstein) Charlier.\n\n==Career==\nCharlier was born in [[Östersund]].  He received his Ph.D. from [[Uppsala University]] in 1887, later worked there and at the [[Stockholm Observatory]] and was Professor of Astronomy and Director of the Observatory at [[Lund University]] from 1897.\n\nHe made extensive statistical studies of the stars in our galaxy and their positions and motions, and tried to develop a model of the galaxy based on this. He proposed the [[siriometer]] as a unit of stellar distance.\n\nCharlier was also interested in pure statistics and played a role in the development of statistics in Swedish academia. Several of his pupils became statisticians, working at universities and in government and companies.\n\nRelated to his work on galactic structure, he also developed a cosmological theory based on the work of [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]]. In the resulting Lambert-Charlier Hierarchical Cosmology, increasingly large areas of space contain decreasing densities of matter, the principle being introduced to avoid the observational inconsistency that would otherwise emerge from [[Olbers Paradox]].\n\nLate in his career, he translated [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''Principia'' into Swedish.  He died in [[Lund]], aged 72.\n\n*[[James Craig Watson Medal]] (1924) \n*[[Bruce Medal]] (1933)\n'''Named after him'''\n*[[Charlier (lunar crater)]]\n*[[Impact crater|Crater]] on [[Mars]] \n*[[Asteroid]] [[8677 Charlier]]\n*[[Charlier polynomials]]\n\n==Publications==\n*Carl Ludwig Charlier: \tDie Mechanik des Himmels, 1902–1907, Leipzig: Veit, (2 volumes) (2nd edition in 1927)\n*[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22157/22157-h/22157-h.htm Lectures on Stellar Statistics.
