He began as a journalist; at the age of 20, he was editor of the Council Bluffs ''Nonparell'', later writing editorials for the ''[[Washington Post]]''. Snyder was also something of a science writer, authoring popular articles in magazines such as ''McClure's'' and the ''Fortnightly Review'' about, for example, Jacques Loeb's experiments on the nature of living tissue. He was a [[president of the American Statistical Association]], a Fellow of the American Association for Advancement of Science and of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and a member of the Institut Internationale de Statistique.\n\nIn the 1910s and 20s, Snyder was employed as a statistician in the research department of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]], under [[Benjamin Strong]]. The two men clashed, but still respected each other. During these years, he lectured at American universities and contributed to [[economic]] and statistical journals.\n\nSnyder's response to the [[Great Depression]] was to write his ''magnum opus'' ''[http://mises.org/books/creator.pdf Capitalism the Creator]'' (Macmillan). The book, written in an eccentric prose style replete with fragmentary sentences, is part classical liberal manifesto, part elucubration of an enthusiastic statistical autodidact. It blamed the Depression on the Fed's failure to stabilize the money stock and the price level.\n\nThe nearest thing to a biography of Snyder is:\n\n* Garvy, George, 1978, \"Carl Snyder, Pioneer Economic Statistician and Monetarist,\" ''[[History of Political Economy]]'' 10: 454–90. {{doi|10.1215/00182702-10-3-454}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/cgi-bin/snyder_mem.cgi Carl Snyder Memorial Lecture at UCSB]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Snyder, Carl\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American economist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = April 23, 1869\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 1946\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Snyder, Carl}}\n[[Category:1869 births]]\n[[Category:1946 deaths]]\n[[Category:American economists]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n\n\n{{US-economist-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Carl Snyder"}}}}
