Carlo Emilio Bonferroni was born in [[Bergamo]] on 28 January 1892 and died on 18 August 1960 in [[Florence]]. He studied in [[Turin]], held a post as assistant professor at the Turin Polytechnic, and in 1923 took up the chair of financial mathematics at the Economics Institute in Bari. In 1933 he transferred to Florence where he held his chair until his death.\n\nBonferroni is best known for the [[Bonferroni inequalities]] (a generalization of the [[Boole's inequality|union bound]]) and the [[Bonferroni correction]] in statistics.\nHowever, although his inequalities can be used to derive the Bonferroni correction, the correction itself was not explicitly documented until the later work of Dunn in the 1960s.<ref>{{citation|title=Understanding and Using Statistics in Psychology: A Practical Introduction|first1=Jeremy|last1=Miles|first2=Philip|last2=Banyard|publisher=SAGE|year=2007|isbn=9780761943976|page=258|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeBEf7HqGvQC&pg=PA258}}.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.dewey.myzen.co.uk/bonf/bonf.html Material about Bonferroni] by Michael Dewey.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Bonferroni, Carlo Emilio\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Italian mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 28 January 1892\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Bergamo, Italy\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 18 August 1960\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = Florence, Italy\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bonferroni, Carlo Emilio}}\n[[Category:1892 births]]\n[[Category:1960 deaths]]\n[[Category:Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:19th-century Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Probability theorists]]\n[[Category:Italian statisticians]]\n\n\n{{Italy-mathematician-stub}}\n{{statistician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Carlo Emilio Bonferroni"}}}}
