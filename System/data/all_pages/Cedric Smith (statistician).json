Smith was born in [[Leicester]] to John Bardell Smith, an engineer, and Ada Smith (née Horrocks). He was educated at Wyggeston Boys' School (now [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College]]) until 1929, when the family moved to London. His education continued at [[Bec School]], [[Tooting]], for three years, then at [[University College School]], London. In 1935, although having failed his [[Higher School Certificate (UK)|Higher School Certificate]], he was awarded an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He graduated in the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematical Tripos]], with a First in Part II in 1937 and a Distinction in Part III in 1938. Following graduation he began postgraduate research, taking his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1942.\n\n==Work on combinatorics==\nWhile a student at Cambridge, Smith became close friends with three other students at Trinity College, [[Rowland L. Brooks|R. L. Brooks]], [[Arthur Harold Stone|A. H. Stone]] and [[W. T. Tutte]]. Together they tackled a number of problems in the mathematical field of [[combinatorics]] and devised an imaginary mathematician, '[[Blanche Descartes]]', under which name to publish their work. The group studied dissections of rectangles into squares, especially the 'perfect' [[squared square]], a square that is divided into a number of smaller squares, no two of which are the same size. Publications under the name of 'Blanche Descartes' or 'F. de Carteblanche' continued to appear into the 1980s. The group also published more mainstream articles under their own names, the final one being R.L. Brooks, C.A.B. Smith, A.H. Stone and W.T. Tutte, 'Determinants and current flows in electric networks', Discrete Math., Vol. 100 (1992).\n\n==World War II==\nDuring [[World War II]], as a [[Quaker]] and [[conscientious objector]], Smith joined the Friends Relief Service; he worked as a [[hospital porter]] at [[Addenbrooke's Hospital|Addenbrooke’s Hospital]] in Cambridge. Smith’s pacifist views saw him develop an interest in [[Peace and conflict studies|peace studies]]. Among other responsibilities for the [[Society of Friends]], he was a member of the Quaker Peace Studies Trust which established the chair of Peace Studies at the [[University of Bradford]]. Smith was also a founder member (and Chairman) of the Conflict Research Society.\n\n==Post-war career==\nIn 1946 he was appointed Assistant Lecturer at the [[Galton Laboratory]] at [[University College London]]. He remained at UCL for the rest of his career, becoming successively Lecturer and [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]], before appointment as Weldon Professor of [[Biostatistics|Biometry]] in 1964. On his arrival at UCL, Smith was influenced by [[J. B. S. Haldane]], who introduced him to problems of linkage in human genetics in which field he was able to bring his skills as a statistician to bear. He invented some of the mathematical methods used to map human genes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/gee/about/famous-members\n|title=Former Members|accessdate=19 April 2012|publisher=University College London}}</ref>\n\nSmith was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1945. He was a member of the Genetical Society (serving as Treasurer), the [[International Biometric Society]] (British Region), serving as President 1971&ndash;1972, and the [[International Statistical Institute]].\n\n==Other interests==\nHe was a member of the advisory committee to the [[Anti-Concorde Project]].\n\n==Family==\nIn 1957 he married Piroska Vermes (1921&ndash;2000), known as 'Piri'. They had one son, who survived them.<ref>\"Cedric Smith\" (obituary), ''The Times'', 21 February 2002.</ref> Piri's father, Dr. Paul Vermes (1897&ndash;1968), was a Hungarian refugee who became a professional mathematician at the age of 50.\n\n==See also==\n*[[BEST theorem]]\n\n==References==\n* The Detection of Linkage in Human Genetics, [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]].
