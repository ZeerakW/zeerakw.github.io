His early schooling was in Wellington and he was [[dux]] of [[Hutt Valley High School]] in 1957.  He earned his Bachelor of Science (a double major in Applied and Pure Mathematics and a further double major in Physics and Mathematical Physics) and in 1962 he earned a Masters of Science with first class honours in Mathematics, all from [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. The bachelor's degree was from the [[University of New Zealand]], as the constituent colleges of UNZ, of which Victoria University College was one of four, had proliferated into four autonomous Universities by the time Pearce completed his master's degree.<ref name=Festschrift/>\n\n==New Zealand origins==\nPearce always remained proud of his [[New Zealand]] origins. Being descended from [[Māori people|Maori]] people, he claimed his New Zealand ancestry was longer than almost all his peers from New Zealand.<ref name=Festschrift>{{cite journal |author= [[Derek Abbott]] |url= http://journal.austms.org.au/ojs/index.php/ANZIAMJ/article/downloadSuppFile/2909/528 |title= Banquet Speech in Honour of Charles E. M. Pearce's 70th Birthday (Charles Pearce's Festschrift) |journal= ANZIAM Journal |issue=51 |date=23 February 2010 |pages=CI-CIX |publisher= Australian Mathematical Society, austms.org.au |ISSN= 1446-8735 }}</ref>\n\nPearce is descended from Alexander Gray, one of just five Scots who settled in New Zealand as part of the original and largely strong interest in [[Māori culture|Maoritanga]] and claimed ancestral connection to three waka (canoes) in the heke (migration): Aotea, Kurahaupo and Takatimu. His principal tribal connection was with the [[Ngati Ruanui]], based in the southern [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]].<ref name=Festschrift/>\n\n==Life and career==\nIn 1963 Pearce left New Zealand for doctoral study at the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) in [[Canberra]], under the supervision of [[Pat Moran (statistician)|Pat Moran]]. Thereafter followed short stints (1 to 3 years) as Lecturer at: ANU; [[University of Queensland]] (visiting Professor); [[University of Rennes 1|Université de Rennes 1]], France; and [[University of Sheffield]] (1966–68).<ref name=Festschrift/> He was appointed to the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1968 and remained there for the ensuing years, having been promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1971, Reader in 1982 and Professor in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |title= Dr Charles Pearce promoted to Professor, effective July 2003 |date=15 December 2003 |url= http://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news634.html |work=Media Release, University of Adelaide |author= Vice-Chancellor Professor [[James McWha]] }}</ref> He was a leading figure in the Department of Applied Mathematics there, being appointed in 2005 to the Elder Chair of Mathematics.\n\nWhile at ANU, he met and married Frances (née O'Connor), and they brought up their two daughters, Emma and Ann, in [[Adelaide]].<ref name=Festschrift/> Charles died in a motor vehicle accident near Fox Glacier on the NZ South Island on 8 June 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.odt.co.nz/regions/west-coast/212657/coast-crash-victim-award-winning-academic |title=Coast crash victim an award-winning academic |work=The Otago Daily Times |date=10 June 2012 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}<br>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-10/australian-killed-in-nz-car-accident/4062954 Pearce's death], www.abc.net.au, 10 June 2012<br>[http://au.news.yahoo.com/sa/latest/a/-/article/13915597/australian-killed-in-nz-car-accident/ Pearce's fatal car accident], au.news.yahoo.com</ref>\n\n==Mathematical work==\nHe is known for probabilistic and statistical modelling. Pearce published prolifically in the area of probabilistic and statistical modelling and analysis, with strong contributions being made in both theory and practice. His book with Dragomir addresses the fine points of the [[Hermite–Hadamard inequality]] and is published by Kluwer Academic Press. His applied interests included [[queuing theory]], [[Traffic optimization|road traffic]], [[telecommunications]], and [[urban planning]]. With former student Bill Henderson, who followed him from Sheffield to Adelaide, he helped establish the successful Teletraffic Centre in the [[University of Adelaide]].  Publications are numerous and include three books, 23 book chapters, and over 300 research articles.\n\nWith the formation of the Division of Applied Mathematics of the Australian Mathematical society, Pearce soon emerged as a key figure. The most enduring significant role was as Chief Editor of their Applied Mathematics Journal, now called The ANZIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics. The formation of [[ANZIAM]] in 1993 was close to Pearce's heart, as it encapsulated the union he espoused of joint activity in Applied Mathematics involving both Australia and New Zealand. He was a strong worker for ANZIAM and it was fitting that this, along with his outstanding research work, was recognised by the award of the [[ANZIAM Medal]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web | title = Citation for the 2001 ANZIAM Medal | url = http://www.anziam.org.au/The+2001+ANZIAM+Medal | publisher = Australian and New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics | accessdate = 23 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nPearce was elected as a Fellow of the [[New Zealand Mathematical Society]] in 2003 and was awarded the [[Australian Society for Operations Research|ASOR]] Ren Potts Award in 2007.<ref name=ASOR2007>[http://www.asor.org.au/publication/files/dec2007/asor-awards.pdf ASOR Ren Potts Award], December 2007, [[Australian Society for Operations Research]]</ref>\n\n==Books by Pearce==\n* Charles E.
