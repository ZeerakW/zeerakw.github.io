He developed [[mixed model]] equations to obtain [[best linear unbiased prediction]]s of breeding values and, in general, any random effect. He invented three methods for the estimation of [[Random effects model|variance components]] in unbalanced settings of mixed models, and invented a method for constructing the inverse of [[Sewall Wright|Wright's]] numerator [[Coefficient of relationship|relationship]] matrix based on a simple list of pedigree information. He, with his Ph.D. student [[Shayle R. Searle]], greatly extended the use of matrix notation in statistics. His methods are widely used by the domestic livestock industry throughout the world and are a cornerstone of linear model theory.\n\nHenderson obtained his [[B.Sc.]], [[M.Sc.]](nutrition) and [[Ph.D.]](breeding) degrees at [[Iowa State University]], where he was a student of Professor L. N. Hazel. Henderson joined the faculty of the Department of Animal Science at [[Cornell University]] in 1948, and headed the Animal Breeding division for nearly 30 years until he retired in 1976. After retiring from Cornell, he was a visiting professor at the [[University of Guelph]] and [[University of Illinois]] until his death. He completed his book in 1984 at the [[University of Guelph]].\n\n==Honors and awards==\n* 1955, Senior [[Fulbright]] Research Scholar (New Zealand)\n* 1964, Borden Award, [[American Dairy Science Association]]\n* 1964, Animal Breeding and Genetics Award, [[American Society of Animal Science]]\n* 1969, Fellow, [[American Statistical Association]]\n* 1971, Morrison Award, American Society of Animal Science\n* 1977, National Association of Animal Breeders Award, American Dairy Science Association\n* 1980, Member of the [[Massey University]] Wellington\n* 1981, Visiting professor at the [[University of California, Davis]]\n* 1981, [[Hermann-von-Nathusius-Medaille]] in Gold of the [[:de:Deutsche Gesellschaft für Züchtungskunde|German Society for Animal Production]] (DGfZ) <ref>[http://www.dgfz-bonn.de/hermann_von_nathusius.html List of people honored with the Herman-von-Nathusius-Medaille]</ref>\n* 1981, Fellow, American Society of Animal Science\n* 1982, Jay L.
