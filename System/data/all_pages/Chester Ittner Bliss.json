He was born in [[Springfield, Ohio]] in 1899 and died in 1979. He was the first secretary of the [[International Biometric Society]].\n\n==Academic qualifications==\n\n*[[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Entomology]] from [[Ohio State University]], 1921\n*[[Master of Arts]] from [[Columbia University]], 1922\n*[[PhD]] from [[Columbia University]], 1926\n\nRemarkably, his statistical knowledge was largely self-taught and developed according to the problems he wanted to solve (Cochran & Finney 1979).\n\n==Major contributions==\n\nArguably his most important contribution was the development, with [[Ronald Fisher]], of an iterative approach to finding [[maximum likelihood]] estimates in the [[probit]] method of [[bioassay]]. Additional contributions in [[biological assay]] were work on the analysis of time-mortality data and of slope-ratio assays (Cochran & Finney 1979).\n\nBliss introduced the word [[rankit]], meaning an [[expected value|expected]] [[normal distribution|normal]] [[order statistic]].\n\n==References==\n* C.
