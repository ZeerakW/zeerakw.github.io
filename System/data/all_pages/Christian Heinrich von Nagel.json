From 1821 to 1825, he took a four-year course of theology at the [[Tübinger Stift]]. Soon after his graduation, he became interested in mathematics. He became mathematics and science teacher at the Lyceum and at the Secondary school in [[Tübingen]]. Already in 1826, he earned doctorate at the local Faculty of Philosophy on a theme ''De triangulis rectangulis ex algebraica aequatione construendis'' (About right triangles construable from an algebraic equation). Until 1830, he held post of a private lecturer in Tübingen. In that year, he moved to [[Ulm]] where he had a better-paid job as a teacher at the Gymnasium in Ulm. Later he was rector of the affiliated Realschule. He was ennobled in 1875.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eddy R.
