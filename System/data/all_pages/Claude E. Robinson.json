Robinson''' (1900&ndash;1961) was an [[United States|American]] pioneer in [[advertising]] research and [[opinion survey]] research techniques. Along with [[George Gallup]], he was instrumental in developing many scientific [[sampling techniques]] that were later used in [[Gallup poll]]s and other [[public opinion]] research surveys.\n\n== Life ==\n\nClaude Robinson was born in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1900, the son of a teacher. He left high school to join the Army during [[World War I]] but later returned to Oregon to work his way through the [[University of Oregon]] where he won the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] key. He received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in [[sociology]] from [[Columbia University]].\n\nIn 1929, while still a student at Columbia, Robinson filed for [[Patent]] #1961170, an invention for recording the tuning of individual radio sets for what he imagined would be a ratings industry. This invention would record what a radio was tuned to, when it was turned on, and the length of time turned on. Further, the object of the invention would provide for scientifically measuring broadcast listener response over a selected period of time. Robinson sold his patent to [[RCA]]. Eventually, [[A.C. Nielsen]] developed the AudiMeter, or PeopleMeter, on which the Nielsen rating system was founded. The [[A.C. Nielsen Company]] continues to measure and compile statistics on television audiences and their viewing habits.\n\nIn 1932, Robinson published 'Straw Votes, a Study of Political Prediction', a pioneering book on scientific [[Opinion poll|polling]] that was based on his doctoral dissertation.\n\nRobinson was the Associate Director of the American Institute of Public Opinion, later called [[Gallup poll]]s.\n\nIn 1938, he organized [[Opinion Research Corporation]] (ORC) that provides survey and [[market research]] services for public and private enterprises. In 1948, with George Gallup, he founded [[Gallup and Robinson]], Inc., an [[advertising research]] company.\n\nIn 1945, the National Association of Public Relations Council presented Robinson with an award. He was considered to have made the greatest contribution during that year, through public relations, to the national welfare.\n\nIn 1960, Robinson served as the chief pollster for Vice-President [[Richard M. Nixon]]'s unsuccessful presidential campaign against Senator [[John F. Kennedy]]. A few days after the election Kennedy and Nixon met in Florida. When Kennedy asked Nixon to rate Robinson's performance as his pollster, Nixon told Kennedy that Robinson's \"polls in individual states were almost miraculously accurate.\" (Nixon, p.&nbsp;483)\n\n== Study of American capitalism ==\n\nClaude E. Robinson made important contributions to the study of American [[capitalism]]. He chaired the [[Princeton University]] panel &mdash; Center for the Study and Teaching of Principles of American Capitalism.\n\nHe also served as a trustee of the Committee for Economic Development and the [[Foundation for Economic Education]].\n\nHis book \"Understanding Profits\" was published posthumously in 1961.\n\nClaude E. Robinson died on August 7, 1961, from hepatitis following a cancer operation.\n\n== Books ==\n\n''Straw Votes: A Study of Political Prediction'', by Claude E. Robinson, Robert E.
