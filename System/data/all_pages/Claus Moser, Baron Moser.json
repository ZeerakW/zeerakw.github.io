His father was Dr Ernst (Ernest) Moser (1885–1957), owner of the Bank \"Ernst Moser & Co.\" in Berlin (est.  1902, [[liquidated]] in 1937). His mother was Lotte (née Goldberg, 1897–1976), a talented amateur musician. In 1936 he moved to [[England]] with his parents and his brother Heinz Peter August. He went to [[Frensham Heights School]] and the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). Despite being [[Jew]]ish, in 1940, he was [[internment|interned]] as an enemy alien in [[Huyton#Second World War|Huyton Camp]]. \n\nAfter four months, he was released and served in the [[Royal Air Force]], 1943–1946. He then returned to LSE as Assistant Lecturer, then Lecturer, in Statistics, 1946–1955; Reader in [[Social Statistics]], 1955–1961; Professor of Social Statistics, 1961–1970; Visiting Professor of Social Statistics, 1970–1975.\n\nHe was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[1965 New Year Honours]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43529 |date=1 January 1965 |startpage=10 |supp=yes}}</ref> and in 1965, he applied for a job at the [[Central Statistical Office, UK|Central Statistical Office]] but was rejected, as a former enemy alien. However, this did not seem to be a problem when in 1967 [[Harold Wilson]] appointed him Director of the Central Statistical Office. He was made a [[Knight Commander of the Bath]] (KCB) in the [[1973 New Year Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=45860 |date=1 January 1973 |startpage=3 |supp=yes}}</ref> He resigned as Director in 1978.\n\nHe held a very wide variety of other posts.
