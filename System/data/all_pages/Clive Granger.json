In 2003, Granger was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], in recognition that he and his co-winner, [[Robert F. Engle]], had made contributions to the analysis of time series data that had changed fundamentally the way in which economists analyse financial and macroeconomic data.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/09/business/09ECON.html |title=Two Professors, Collaborators in Econometrics, Win the Nobel |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=9 October 2003 }}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nClive Granger was born in 1934 in Britain, in [[Swansea]], south [[Wales]], the son of Edward John Granger and Evelyn Granger.<ref name=nobelbio>{{Cite book | chapter = Clive W.J.

He started secondary school in Cambridge, but continued in [[Nottingham]], where his family moved after the war. During school, Granger showed talent for mathematics, developing a strong interest in applied mathematics.\n\nAfter secondary school Granger enrolled at the [[University of Nottingham]] for a joint degree in economics and mathematics, but switched to full mathematics in the second year. After receiving his BA in 1955, he remained at the University of Nottingham for a PhD in statistics under the supervision of [[Harry Pitt]].\n\nIn 1956, at only 21, Granger was appointed a junior lecturer in statistics at the University. As he was interested mainly in applied statistics and economics Granger chose as the topic of his doctoral thesis [[Time series|time series analysis]], a field in which he felt that relatively little work had been done at the time.<ref name=nobelbio/> In 1959 he obtained his PhD with a thesis on \"Testing for [[Stationary process|Non-stationarity]]\".\n\n===Academic life===\nGranger spent the next academic year, 1959–60, in the USA at [[Princeton University]] under a [[Harkness Fellowship]] of the Commonwealth Fund. He had been invited to Princeton by [[Oskar Morgenstern]] to participate in his Econometric Research Project. Here, Granger worked with [[Michio Hatanaka]] as assistants to [[John Tukey]] in a project to use [[Fourier analysis]] on economic data.\n\nAt the end of the year in Princeton, Granger got married, and spent the honeymoon in a trip across the US.\n\nIn 1964 Granger and Hatanaka published the results of their research in a book on ''Spectral Analysis of Economic Time Series'' (Tukey had encouraged them to write this themselves, as he was not going to publish the research results.)<ref name=nobelbio/> Granger also wrote in 1963 an article on \"The typical spectral shape of an economic variable\", which appeared in 1966 in ''[[Econometrica]]''. Both the book and the article proved influential in the adoption of the new methods.\n\nGranger also became a full professor at the [[University of Nottingham]].\n\nIn a 1969 paper in ''Econometrica'', Granger also introduced his concept of [[Granger causality]].\n\nAfter reading, in 1968, a pre-print copy of the time series book by [[George Box]] and [[Gwilym Jenkins]],<ref>{{cite book |first=George |last=Box |first2=Gwilym |last2=Jenkins |year=1970 |title=Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Control |location=San Francisco |publisher=Holden-Day |isbn= }}</ref> Granger became interested in forecasting. For the next few years to follow he worked on this subject with his post-doctoral student, [[Paul Newbold]]; and they wrote a book which became a standard reference in time series forecasting (published in 1977). Using simulations, Granger and Newbold also wrote the famous 1974 paper on [[Spurious relationship|spurious regression]]; which lead to a re-evaluation of previous empirical work in economics and to the econometric methodology.<ref name=etinterview>{{cite journal |title=The ET Interview: Professor Clive Granger |first=Peter C.

In 2005, the building that houses the Economics and Geography Departments was renamed the ''Sir Clive Granger Building'' in honour of his Nobel achievement.\n\nIn 1974 Granger moved to the United States, to the [[University of California at San Diego]]. In 1975 he participated in a [[US Bureau of Census]] committee chaired by [[Arnold Zellner]] on [[seasonal adjustment]]. At UCSD, Granger continued his research on time series, collaborating closely with Nobel prize co-recipient [[Robert Engle]] (whom he helped bring to UCSD), [[Roselyne Joyeux]] (on [[Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average|fractional integration]]), {{ill|fi|Timo Teräsvirta}} (on [[nonlinear time series]]) and others. Working with Robert Engle, he developed the concept of [[cointegration]], introduced in a 1987 joint paper in ''[[Econometrica]]'';<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Engle | first1 = Robert F. | last2 = Granger | first2 = C.

Thus, he worked on a project concerned with the [[Amazon rainforest]] and built a model to forecast deforestation. The results were published in a 2002 book.<ref>{{cite book |last=Granger |first=C.

He was a Visiting Eminent Scholar of the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[Canterbury University]].\n\nGranger was married to Patricia (Lady Granger) from 1960 until his death. He is survived by their son, Mark William John, and their daughter, Claire Amanda Jane.<ref name=nobelbio/>\n\nGranger died on 27 May 2009, at Scripps Memorial Hospital in [[La Jolla, California]].<ref name=\"NYT_Obit\" >{{Cite journal | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/31/business/31granger.html | title = Clive Granger, Economist, Dies at 74 | publisher = [[New York Times]] | author = Anahad O'Connor | date = 30 May 2009 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n==Honors and awards==\nIn 2003 Granger and his collaborator Robert Engle were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].
