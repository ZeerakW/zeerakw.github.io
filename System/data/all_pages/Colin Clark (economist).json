He pioneered the use of the [[gross national product]] (\"GNP\") as the basis for studying national economies.\n\n==Early years==\nColin Clark was born in London in 1905 and was educated at the [[Dragon School]] in [[Oxford]]. He then studied at [[Winchester College]], then at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]]<ref>The college retains a small collection of his papers http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/bnc_society/autumn07edition.pdf</ref> where he graduated in Chemistry in 1928. After graduation he worked as a research assistant with [[William Beveridge]] at the [[London School of Economics]] (1928–29) and then with Sir [[Alexander Carr-Saunders]] and [[Allyn Young]] at the [[University of Liverpool]] (1929–30). During this time he ran unsuccessful campaigns to be elected to parliament for the [[British Labour Party]] in the seat of [[North Dorset]] (1929), and later for [[Liverpool Wavertree]] (1931) and [[South Norfolk]] (1935).\n\nIn 1930 he was appointed a research assistant to the Economic Advisory Council newly convened by Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. He resigned shortly after his appointment, after being asked to write a background memorandum to make a case for [[protectionism]]. Despite this, he had sufficiently impressed one of the council members ([[John Maynard Keynes]]) to secure an appointment as a lecturer in statistics at [[Cambridge University]].\n\n==Lecturer at Cambridge==\n\nHe was a lecturer in Statistics in [[Cambridge]] from 1931 to 1938 where he completed three books: \"The National Income 1924–31\" (1932), \"The Economic Position of Great Britain\" (jointly with [[Arthur Cecil Pigou|A.C Pigou]]) (1936) and \"National Income and Outlay\" (1937). His first book was sent to the publisher [[Daniel MacMillan]] with a recommendation from [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]: \"[...] Clark is, I think, a bit of a genius: almost the only economic statistician I have ever met who seems to me quite first-class.\"<ref>Don Patinkin, \"Keynes and Econometrics: On the Interaction between the Macroeconomic Revolutions of the Interwar Period,\" ''[[Econometrica]],'' Vol. 44, No. 6 (Nov. 1976), pp. 1091–1123</ref>\n\n==Move to Australia==\n[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|right|thumb|250px|Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark's sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]\n\nDuring a visit to Australia and [[New Zealand]] in 1937 and 1938 he accepted a position with the Queensland Government at the invitation of the premier [[William Forgan Smith|Forgan Smith]].<ref>Clark named his second son Nicholas Forgan in recognition of Smith's offer</ref> At the time he wrote to [[Keynes]] about his decision to stay in Australia. As he put it, the chance to advise the Queensland Premier on 'practically everything connected with economic matters' was 'too remarkable an opportunity to be missed for putting economics into practice'<ref>http://archive.treasury.gov.au/documents/1689/HTML/docshell.asp?URL=03_Colin_Clark_speech.htm</ref>\n\nOn 6 May 1938, he was appointed Government Statistician, Director of the Bureau of Industry, and Financial Advisor to Queensland Treasury, and provided the State's first set of economic accounts in 1940. He also held the position of Deputy Director (Queensland) of the Commonwealth Department of War Organisation of Industry from 1942 to 1946. Clark resigned as Government Statistician on 28 February 1947 to become Under Secretary of the Queensland Department of Labour and Industry.<ref>http://www.oesr.qld.gov.au/queensland-by-theme/society/bulletins/q150-stats-stories/gov-stats-qld/gov-stats-qld.pdf</ref>\n\nUnusually for a public servant he continued his academic work, publishing numerous articles in Economics and preparing his book \"Conditions of Economic Progress\" which was published in 1940.\n\n==Later Years==\n\nIn 1951 he took a secondment to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] in Rome (1951) and then to the [[University of Chicago]] (1952) before taking the Directorship of the Institute for Agricultural Economics at [[Oxford University]] (1952–69). He returned to Australia in 1969 as the Director of the Institute of Economic Progress at [[Monash University]] (1969–78) and finally as a Research Consultant to the Department of Economics at the [[University of Queensland]] until his death in 1989.\n\nHe was on the Council of the Econometrics Society from 1948 to 1952.<ref>http://www.econometricsociety.org/pastofficers.asp</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\nClark married Marjorie Tattersall in 1931, and they had 8 sons and 1 daughter who in turned produced a total of 40 grandchildren. His son [[Gregory Clark (author)|Gregory]] became an author and academic in Japan.\n\n==Death==\n\nClark died in [[Brisbane, Australia]] in 1989.  He is buried together with his wife Marjorie at the [[Mount Gravatt, Queensland|Mount Gravatt]] Cemetery in Brisbane (Section 3B).<ref>[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/clark-colin-grant-12322 Australian Dictionary of Biography entry for Clark]</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n\nIn 1984 he was named by the [[World Bank]] as one of the ''pioneers of development'' [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64193027&piPK=64187937&theSitePK=523679&menuPK=64187510&searchMenuPK=64187283&siteName=WDS&entityID=000178830_98101901520025] along with Sir [[Arthur Lewis (economist)|Arthur Lewis]], [[Gunnar Myrdal]], [[W.W.
