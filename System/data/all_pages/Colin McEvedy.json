He was the third son of Peter George McEvedy, a renowned surgeon, who was born in New Zealand.<ref>http://archives.li.man.ac.uk/ead/search?operation=full&rsid=dc.title%20any%2Frelevant%2Fproxinfo%20%22Waite%20George%201701%20d%22&hitposition=1299</ref>  Colin was educated at Harrow School, where he was a scholar, and Magdalen College, Oxford.\n\n==Career==\nMcEvedy's profession was psychiatry, in which he had a distinguished career.  He became perhaps better known, though, as a historian and demographer, and certainly so by the public at large.   Between 1961 and 2002 he produced a number of historical atlases which, unlike most such atlases, feature fixed base-maps; in most cases, each atlas uses a single principal base-map, which is shown repeatedly, at many dates, as the atlas goes along, thus illustrating changes over the ages, from [[ancient]] down to [[Modern history|modern]], within the chosen area.  The accompanying text, typically, is mostly a running commentary on what the maps of a given atlas show.  Another feature of the atlases is McEvedy's witty and engaging writing-style, which he used on occasion to challenge established opinions among historians and demographers.  Although he was not, strictly speaking, a professional in those fields, he became professionally respected in them, with his views making their way into standard textbooks.\n\nHe died in [[London]], committing suicide following a diagnosis of terminal leukaemia.<ref>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2574208/Seduced-therapist-Mother-four-Flora-married-barrister-consumed-grief-fathers-suicide-sought-help-man-cruelly-betrayed-trust.html</ref>\n\n==Family life==\nMcEvedy had three daughters,<ref>Obituary: \"Colin McEvedy\", ''British Medical Journal'', 2005, 331:847</ref> Binky, Flora, and Allegra.<ref>Obituary: \"Dr Colin Mcevedy\", ''The Independent'', 30 August 2005</ref> Flora McEvedy is the author of ''The Step-Parents' Parachute'', published by Piatkus Books in 2009.<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0749941243 The Step-Parent's Parachute at amazon.co.uk] Retrieved April 28, 2010</ref> His youngest daughter, [[Allegra McEvedy]], is a noted chef, co-founded the [[Leon Restaurants]] chain, and was appointed Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.\n\n==Publications==\n'''Penguin Historical Atlases'''\n*''The Penguin Atlas of Medieval History'' (1961) ISBN 0-14-070822-7\n**Revised as: ''The New Penguin Atlas of Medieval History'' (1992) ISBN 0-14-051249-7\n*''The Penguin Atlas of Ancient History'' (1967) ISBN 0-14-051151-2\n**Revised as: ''The New Penguin Atlas of Ancient History'' (2002) ISBN 0-14-051348-5\n*''The Penguin Atlas of Modern History'' (1972) ISBN 0-14-051153-9\n*''The Penguin Atlas of Recent History'' (1982) ISBN 0-14-051154-7\n**Revised as: ''The New Penguin Atlas of Recent History'' (2002) ISBN 0-14-051504-6\n*''The Penguin Atlas of North American History'' (1988) ISBN 0-14-051128-8\n*''The Penguin Atlas of African History'' (1980, 2nd ed. 1995) ISBN 0-14-051321-3\n*''The Penguin Historical Atlas of the Pacific'' (1998) ISBN 0-14-025428-5\n\n'''''The Atlas of World History''''' (with Sarah McEvedy)\n*''From the Beginning to Alexander the Great'' (1970) ISBN 0-298-79125-0\n*''The Classical World'' (1973) ISBN 0-298-79126-9\n*''The Dark Ages'' (1972) ISBN 0-298-79127-7\nUnpublished Volumes:\n*''The Medieval World''\n*''The European Expansion''\n*''Revolutions''\n*''Colonial Empires''\n*''The Modern Age''\n\n'''Other Books'''\n*''The Atlas of World Population History'' (with Richard Jones) (1978) ISBN 0-14-051076-1\n*''Rise of the World's Cities'' (1984) ISBN 0-87196-773-1\n*''World History Factfinder'' (1984) ISBN 0-02-583190-9\n*''Cities of the Classical World: An Atlas and Gazetteer of 120 Centres of Ancient Civilization'',<ref>Tonkin, Boyd, \"Cities of the Classical World By Colin McEvedy\", ''The Independent'' (newspaper), United Kingdom, 2012 January 05, book review, Arts section.</ref> (posthumous; edited by Douglas Stuart Oles) (2011 November 3), ISBN 978-1-84614-427-1 (hardcover), Allen Lane (imprint of Penguin Books, UK), Penguin Press/Classics (US).\n\n'''Articles'''\n*\"The Bubonic Plague\" ''[[Scientific American]]'' February 1988\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dr-colin-mcevedy-8715136.html Obituary] in ''[[The Independent]]''\n* [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-1732762,00.html Obituary] in ''[[The Times]]''\n* [http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/331/7520/847 Obituary] in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''\n* {{LCAuth|n80016988|Colin McEvedy|22|ue}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME              = McEvedy, Colin\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = British polymath scholar\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 6 June 1930\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = City of Salford, Lancashire, England, UK\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 1 August 2005\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = London, England, UK\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McEvedy, Colin}}\n[[Category:English writers]]\n[[Category:English psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:English historians]]\n[[Category:British demographers]]\n[[Category:English cartographers]]\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Colin McEvedy"}}}}
