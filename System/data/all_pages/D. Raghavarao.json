He has been specialized in [[combinatorics]] and [[design of experiments|applications of experimental designs]].\n\nRaghavarao received his M.A. in mathematics from [[Nagpur University]], India in 1957 and earned the gold medal. He earned his  Ph.D. in statistics from the [[University of Mumbai]] in 1961 for his work in designs of experiments; his Ph.D. advisor was [[M. C. Chakrabarti]]. Raghavarao was a professor of statistics at [[Punjab Agricultural University]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], [[Cornell University]], and [[University of Guelph]] before joining Temple University.\n\nHe died on February 6, 2013.<ref>[https://www.amstat.org/news/pdfs/Raghavarao-tribute.pdf Damaraju Raghavarao (1938-2013)]</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* {{cite book | title=Constructions and combinatorial problems in design of experiments | authorlink=Damaraju Raghavarao | last=Raghavarao | first=Damaraju|location=New York|year=1971|publisher=Wiley|mr=365935}}\n* {{cite book|title=Constructions and combinatorial problems in design of experiments| authorlink=Damaraju Raghavarao | last=Raghavarao | first=Damaraju |location=New York|year=1988 |edition=corrected reprint of the 1971 Wiley|publisher=Dover |mr=1102899}}\n* {{cite book|title=Block Designs: Analysis, Combinatorics and Applications|first1=Damaraju |last1=Raghavarao| authorlink1=Damaraju Raghavarao | last2=Padgett|first2=L.
