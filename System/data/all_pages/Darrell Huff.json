M. Steele. [http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/Publications/PDF/TN148.pdf Darrell Huff and Fifty Years of ''How to Lie with Statistics'']. ''Statistical Science'', 20 (3), 2005, 205–209.</ref>\n\nHuff was born in [[Gowrie, Iowa]], and educated at the [[University of Iowa]], (BA 1938, MA 1939). Before turning to full-time writing in 1946, Huff served as editor of ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]]'' and ''[[Liberty (1924–1950)|Liberty]]'' magazine. As a freelancer, Huff produced hundreds of \"How to\" feature articles and wrote at least sixteen books, most of which concerned household projects. One of his biggest projects was a prize-winning home in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]], where he lived until his death.\n\nStanford historian [[Robert N. Proctor]] wrote that Huff \"was paid to testify before Congress in the 1950s and then again in the 1960s, with the assigned task of ridiculing any notion of a cigarette-disease link. On March 22, 1965, Huff testified at hearings on cigarette labeling and advertising, accusing the recent Surgeon General's report of myriad failures and 'fallacies'.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Golden Holocaust.

His most famous text, ''How to Lie with Statistics'', is still being translated into new languages. His books have been published in over 22 languages, and continue to be used in classrooms the world over.\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n* Huff, D. (1944).
