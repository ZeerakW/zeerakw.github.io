He entered [[St. John's College, Cambridge]], in 1970 and received his Ph.D. at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1977 under his advisor, D. J. H. Garling.<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=30967}}</ref> Since 1979 Aldous has been on the faculty at [[University of California, Berkeley]].\n\nHe was awarded the [[Rollo Davidson Prize]] in 1980, the [[Loève Prize]] in 1993, and was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1994. In 2004, Aldous was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref> In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 3 November 2012.</ref>\n\n== Selected publications ==\n===Books===\n* {{cite book| last=Aldous | first=David |  <!-- authorlink=David Aldous --> | title=Probability approximations via the Poisson clumping heuristic | series=Applied Mathematical Sciences | volume=77 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York | year=1989 | pages=xvi+269 | isbn=0-387-96899-7 | mr=969362 }}\n\n===Papers===\n* Aldous, David,  \"Deterministic and stochastic models for coalescence (aggregation and coagulation): a review of the mean-field theory for probabilists\".
