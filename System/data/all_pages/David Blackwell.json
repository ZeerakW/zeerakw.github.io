In 1938 he earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics, a master's degree in 1939, and was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics in 1941 at the age of 22, all by the University of Illinois.<ref>\n{{citation | title = Distinguished African American Scientists of the 20th Century | author = James H.

He was offered a post at [[Southern University]] at Baton Rouge, which he held in 1942–43, followed by a year as an Instructor at [[Clark Atlanta University|Clark College]] in Atlanta. He then moved to [[Howard University]] in 1944 and within three years was appointed full professor and head of the Mathematics Department.<ref name = \"NYT-Grime-2007-07-17\"/>\nHe remained at Howard until 1954.\n\nHe took a position at University of California Berkeley as a visiting professor in 1954, and was hired by UC Berkeley as a full professor in the newly created Statistics Department in 1955, becoming the Statistics department chair in 1956.<ref name = \"NYT-Grime-2007-07-17\"/><ref>\n{{citation | journal = Statistical Science | author = Morris H.

Basically, I'm not interested in doing research and I never have been. I'm interested in understanding, which is quite a different thing.
