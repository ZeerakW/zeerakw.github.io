He is titular Professor of [[Biostatistics]] in the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Wellcome Trust]] and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Principal Research Fellow in the Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, where he chairs the statistics group. Clayton is an [[ISI highly cited researcher]] placing him in the top 250 most cited scientists in the mathematics world over the last 20 years.\n\nClayton has worked in theoretical and applied statistics, both [[frequentist statistics|frequentist]] and [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]]. With [[Norman Breslow]] he has published important work on [[generalized linear mixed model]]s. Clayton was a pioneer in the application of [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo|MCMC]] methods to problems in biostatistics. More recently, he has worked in [[genetic epidemiology]].\n\nClayton read [[Natural Sciences]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]] and following this worked as a researcher in [[ergonomics]] and [[cybernetics]]. He then worked as a statistician at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]], the [[University of Leicester]] and the MRC Biostatistics Unit in Cambridge before taking up his present position.\n\nHe was awarded the [[Guy Medal]] in Silver of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1990 and, with Norman Breslow, the  Snedecor Prize of the [[Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies]] of North America (COPSS) in 1995.
