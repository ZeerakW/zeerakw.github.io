From 1956 to 1966 he was Reader and then Professor of Statistics at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, London]]. In 1966, he took up the Chair position in Statistics at [[Imperial College London]] where he later became head of the mathematics department. In 1988 he became Warden of [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]] and a member of the Department of Statistics at Oxford University. He formally retired from these positions in 1994.\n\nCox has received numerous honorary doctorates. He has been awarded the [[Guy Medal]]s in Silver (1961) and Gold (1973) of the [[Royal Statistical Society]]. He was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]] in 1973, was [[Knight bachelor|knighted]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1985<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=50221 |date=6 August 1985 |startpage=10815}}</ref> and became an Honorary Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 2000. He is a Foreign Associate of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]] and a foreign member of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]]. In 1990 he won the Kettering Prize and Gold Medal for Cancer Research for \"the development of the Proportional Hazard Regression Model.\" In 2010 he was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] of the Royal Society \"for his seminal contributions to the theory and applications of statistics.\"\n\nHe has supervised, collaborated with, and encouraged many younger researchers now prominent in statistics. He has served as President of the [[Bernoulli Society]], of the [[Royal Statistical Society]], and of the [[International Statistical Institute]]. He is an Honorary Fellow of [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], and is a member of the Department of Statistics at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\nHe has made pioneering and important contributions to numerous areas of statistics and applied probability, of which the best known is perhaps the [[proportional hazards model]], which is widely used in the analysis of survival data. An example is survival times in medical research that can be related to information about the patients such as age, diet or exposure to certain chemical substances. The [[Cox process]] was named after him.\n\n===Personal life===\nIn 1947 he married Joyce Drummond and they have four children and two grandchildren.\n\n==Bibliography==\nSir David Cox has written or co-authored 300 papers and books. From 1966 to 1991 he was the editor of [[Biometrika]]. His books are as follows:\n*''Planning of experiments'' (1958)\n*''Queues'' ([[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], 1961).  With [[Walter L.
