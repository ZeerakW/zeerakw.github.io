Curtis and Margaret Wasson Heath. He graduated from [[Elkhart High School]] in 1960 and earned his Bachelor degree from [[Kalamazoo College]] in 1964.\n\n===Scientific career===\nHeath obtained his PhD in 1969 under the supervision of [[Frank Bardsley Knight]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] with a dissertation titled 'Probabilistic Analysis of Hyperbolic Systems of Partial Differential Equations'. After graduation, he became an assistant professor at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In the late 1970s, he moved to [[Cornell University]] where he joined the School of Operations Research and Industrial Engineering. There he founded the [[financial engineering]] program, becoming the Merrill Lynch Professor of Financial Engineering. In the late 1990s Heath moved to [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in Pittsburgh, where he became the Orion Hoch Professor of Mathematical Sciences, and where he stayed until his retirement in 2006.\n\n== Selected Bibliography ==\n\n* Heath, David C., and William D.
