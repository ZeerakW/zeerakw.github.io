Cox]]. In 1974 Hinkley and Cox published a textbook on statistical inference, of unusual breadth and conceptual interest.\n\nHinkley has also collaborated with [[Bradley Efron]], in particular on writing a paper on [[maximum likelihood|maximizing]] the [[likelihood_function#Conditional_likelihood|conditional likelihood function]] and on using the [[observed information|observed]] [[Fisher information]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |last1=Efron   |first1=B.   |authorlink1=Bradley Efron\n |last2=Hinkley |first2=D.V. <!-- |authorlink2=David V.

With Anthony C. Davison, Hinkley wrote a text on bootstrapping; their text, \"Davison-Hinkley\", is widely used and referenced.<ref>Davison, A. C.; Hinkley, D. (2006).
