Recognition for his work includes being elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1984, where he was cited for his achievements on the construction problem for Markov chains and on path decompositions for Brownian motion,<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Williams, David\n  | work = Library and Archive catalogue\n  | publisher = The Royal Society\n  | url = http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqSearch=RefNo=='EC/1984/38'&dsqDb=Catalog\n  | accessdate = 2008-01-24}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and being awarded the [[London Mathematical Society]]'s [[Pólya Prize (LMS)|Pólya Prize]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = LMS Prizewinners\n  | publisher = London Mathematical Society\n  | url = http://www.lms.ac.uk/activities/prizes_com/pastwinners.html#polya\n  | accessdate = 2008-01-24}}</ref>\n\nHe is the author of ''Probability With Martingales'' and ''Weighing the Odds'', and co-author (with [[Chris Rogers (mathematician)|L.
