Li.<ref name=ft/> His financial career began in 1997 at [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] World Markets division.<ref name=\"wired\"/> He eventually moved to [[New York City]] and in 2000, he was a partner in [[J.P. Morgan]]'s RiskMetrics unit.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/business/2009/03/18/meet_the_man_whose_big_idea_felled_wall_street.html | location=Toronto | work=The Star}}</ref> By 2003 he was director and global head of credit [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] research at [[Citigroup]].<ref name=ft/> In 2004 he moved to [[Barclays Capital]] and headed up the credit [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative analytics]] team.<ref name=\"wired\"/> In 2008 Li moved to [[Beijing]] where he works for [[China International Capital Corporation]] as head of the [[risk management]] department.<ref name=\"wired\"/>\n\n==CDOs and Gaussian copula==\nLi's paper \"On Default Correlation: A Copula Function Approach\"<ref name=paper/> (2000) was the first appearance of the [[Gaussian copula]] applied to CDOs, which quickly became a tool for financial institutions to correlate associations between multiple [[Security (finance)|securities]].<ref name=\"wired\"/> This allowed for CDOs to be supposedly accurately priced for a wide range of investments that were previously too complex to price, such as [[mortgages]]. However, in the aftermath of the [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009]] the model has been seen as fundamentally flawed and a \"recipe for disaster\".<ref name=\"wired\"/> According to [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], \"People got very excited about the Gaussian copula because of its mathematical elegance, but the thing never worked. Co-association between securities is not measurable using [[correlation]]\"; in other words, because history is not predictive of the future, \"[a]nything that relies on correlation is charlatanism.\"<ref name=\"wired\"/>\n\nLi himself apparently understood the fallacy of his model, in 2005 saying \"Very few people understand the essence of the model.\"<ref name=wsj>[http://math.bu.edu/people/murad/MarkWhitehouseSlicesofRisk.txt \"Slices of Risk\"], Mark Whitehouse, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', September 12, 2005</ref> Li also wrote that \"The current copula framework gains its popularity owing to its simplicity....However, there is little theoretical justification of the current framework from financial economics....We essentially have a credit portfolio model without solid credit portfolio theory.\"<ref>The Definitive Guide to CDOs, Edited by Gunter Meissner, pg. 71, 2008, Risk Books</ref> Kai Gilkes of [[CreditSights]] says \"Li can't be blamed\", although he invented the model, it was the bankers who misinterpreted and misused it.<ref name=\"wired\"/>\n\n===Li's paper===\n{{BLP primary sources|section|date=May 2011}}\n\nLi's paper is called \"On Default Correlation: A Copula Function Approach\" (2000), published in ''[[Journal of Fixed Income]]'', Vol. 9, Issue 4, pages 43–54.<ref name=paper/>\n\nIn section 1 through 5.3, Li describes actuarial math that sets the stage for his theory.  The mathematics are from established statistical theory, actuarial models, and probability theory.\n\nIn section 5.4, he uses [[Copula (statistics)#Gaussian copula|Gaussian Copula]] to measure event relationships, or mathematically, ''correlations'', between random economic events, expressed as:\n\n::<math>C_\\rho(u,v) = \\Phi_\\rho \\left(\\Phi^{-1}(u), \\Phi^{-1}(v) \\right) </math>\n\nIn layman's terms, he proposes there is a relationship between 2 different but related events i.e. \"House A\" defaulting and \"House B\" defaulting are measurable using correlation. While under some scenarios (such as real estate) this correlation appeared to work most of the time, the underlying problem is that history ultimately cannot predict the future.\n\nFrom 6.0 onward, the paper presents experimental results using the Gaussian Copula. The results are favorable to Li's proposal.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Li, David X.\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Chinese statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1960s\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = China\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Li, David X.}}\n[[Category:Chinese statisticians]]\n[[Category:1960s births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Actuaries]]\n[[Category:University of Waterloo alumni]]\n[[Category:Nankai University alumni]]\n[[Category:Université Laval alumni]]\n[[Category:Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce people]]\n[[Category:Citigroup employees]]\n[[Category:Barclays people]]\n[[Category:Chinese emigrants to Canada]]\n[[Category:JPMorgan Chase employees]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "David X.
