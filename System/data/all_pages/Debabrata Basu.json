Basu invented simple examples that displayed some difficulties of [[likelihood function|likelihood]]-based statistics and [[frequentist statistics]]; Basu's paradoxes were especially important in the development of [[survey sampling]]. In [[statistical theory]], [[Basu's theorem]] [[mathematical proof|established]] the [[statistical independence|independence]] of a [[completeness (statistics)|complete]] [[sufficient statistic]] and an [[ancillary statistic]].<ref name=\"projecteuclid\">\nPage i in {{cite book| last1=Ghosh|first=Malay| last2=Pathak|first2=Pramod K. | chapter=Preface|title=Current Issues in Statistical Inference—Essays in Honor of D.

His father, N. M. Basu, was a mathematician specialising in number theory. Young Basu studied mathematics at [[Dacca University]]. He took a course in statistics as part of the under-graduate honours programme in Mathematics but his ambition was to become a pure mathematician.<ref>\nPage xvii in {{cite book|chapter=A Summing Up|first=D.|last=Basu|title=Statistical Information and Likelihood: A Collection of Critical Essays by Dr. D.

In 1948, he moved to Calcutta, where he worked for some time as an [[actuary]] in an insurance company. In 1950, he joined the [[Indian Statistical Institute]] as a research scholar under [[C.R. Rao]].<ref>Page i in \"Preface\" to IMS festschrift. (C.f., {{cite book|chapter=A Summing Up|first=D.|last=Basu|title=Statistical Information and Likelihood: A Collection of Critical Essays by Dr. D.

Wald greatly impressed Basu. Wald had developed a decision-theoretic foundations for statistics in which [[Bayesian statistics]] was a central part, because of Wald's theorem characterising [[admissible decision rule]]s as Bayesian decision rules (or limits of Bayesian decision rules). Wald also showed the power of using [[measure theory|measure-theoretic]] [[probability theory]] in statistics.\n\nIn 1953, after submitting his thesis to the [[University of Calcutta]],<ref name=\"Page\" /> Basu went as a [[Fulbright scholar]] to the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. There Basu had intensive discussions with [[Jerzy Neyman]] and \"his brilliant younger colleagues\" like [[Erich Leo Lehmann]].<ref>Page xvii in Basu's ''A Summing Up''.</ref> [[Basu's theorem]] comes from this time. Basu thus had a good understanding of the decision-theoretic approach to statistics of Neyman, [[Egon Pearson|Pearson]] and Wald. In fact, Basu is described as having returned from Berkeley to India as a \"complete Neyman Pearsonian\" by [[J. K. Ghosh]].<ref>Page viii of J. K. Ghosh's preface to the selected essays of Basu.</ref>\n\n[[File:Biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher]]\n\nBasu met [[Ronald Fisher]] in the winter of 1954–1955; he wrote in 1988, \"With his reference set argument, Sir Ronald was trying to find a via media between the two poles of Statistics&nbsp;– Berkeley and Bayes.<ref>The term \"Berkeley\" has several meanings, here. Basu refers to the leadership of [[Jerzy Neyman]]'s department of statistics at the University of California at Berkeley in the world of frequentist statistics. Secondly, Basu alludes to the British philosopher [[George Berkeley]] who criticized the use of [[infinitesimal]]s in [[mathematical analysis]]; Berkeley's criticisms were answered by [[Thomas Bayes]] in a pamphlet.</ref> My efforts to understand this Fisher compromise led me to the [[likelihood principle]]\".<ref>Page xvii in Ghosh (ed.)</ref> In their [[festschrift]] for Basu, the editors [[Malay Ghosh]] and Patak write that\n\n<blockquote>[Basu's] critical examination of both the Neyman–Pearsonian and the Fisherian modes of inference eventually forced him to a Bayesian point of view, via the likelihood route. The final conversion to Bayesianism came in January 1968, when Basu was invited to speak at a Bayesian Session in the Statistics Section of the Indian Science Congress. He confesses that, while preparing for these lectures, he became convinced that Bayesian inference did indeed provide one with a logical resolution of the underlying inconsistencies of both the Neyman–Pearson and the Fisherian theories. Since then, Dr. Basu became an ardent Bayesian and, in many of his foundation papers, pointed out the deficiencies of both the Neyman–Pearsonian and the Fisherian methods.<ref name=\"projecteuclid\" /> </blockquote>\n\nAfter 1968, Basu began writing polemical essays, which provided paradoxes to frequentist statistics, and which produced great discussion in statistical journals and at statistical meetings. Particularly stimulating papers were Basu's papers on the foundations of survey sampling.<ref>Ghosh's editorial notes.</ref> There is an extensive literature discussing Basu's problem of estimating the weight of the elephants at a circus with an enormous bull elephant named Jumbo<ref>{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Brewer| title=Combined Survey Sampling Inference: Weighing of Basu's Elephants| publisher=Hodder Arnold|year= 2002|isbn=978-0-340-69229-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last=Pavía|first=Jose M.
