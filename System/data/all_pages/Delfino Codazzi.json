For a long period Codazzi taught first at the Ginnasio Liceale of [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]], then at the liceo of [[Pavia]]. Meanwhile, he devoted himself to research in [[differential geometry]].\n\nIn 1865,  he was appointed professor of complementary algebra and [[analytic geometry]] at University of Pavia. He remained in his position at Pavia until his death in 1873.\n\nHe also obtained results concerning isometric lines, [[Differential geometry of surfaces|geodesic triangles]], [[equiareal map]]ping and the stability of floating bodies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Topics named after Carl Friedrich Gauss]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{MacTutor Biography|id=Codazzi}}\n*[http://mathematica.sns.it/autori/887/ An Italian short biography of Delfino Codazzi] in ''Edizione Nazionale Mathematica Italiana'' online.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Codazzi, Delfino\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Italian mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = March 7, 1824\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = July 21, 1873\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Codazzi, Delfino}}\n[[Category:1824 births]]\n[[Category:1873 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Lodi, Lombardy]]\n[[Category:Differential geometers]]\n[[Category:Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:19th-century Italian mathematicians]]\n\n\n{{Italy-bio-stub}}\n{{Italy-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Delfino Codazzi"}}}}
