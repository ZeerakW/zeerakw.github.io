He was an only child and his father was a local building contractor. Lindley recalled (to [[Adrian Smith (academic)|Adrian Smith]]) that the family had \"little culture\" and that both his parents were \"proud of the fact that they had never read a book.\" The school Lindley attended, [[Tiffin School]], introduced him to \"ordinary cultural activities.\"<ref>[http://www.bayesian.org/awards/LindleyPrize.html \"The Lindley Prize – Dennis V. Lindley\"], [[International Society for Bayesian Analysis]], ''accessed 28 June 2008''</ref> From there Lindley went to read mathematics at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1941. During the war the degree course lasted only two years and, on finishing, Lindley had a choice between entering the armed forces and joining the Civil Service as a statistician. He chose the latter and, after taking a short course given by [[Joseph Oscar Irwin|Oscar Irwin]] which he \"did not understand\", he joined a section of the [[Ministry of Supply]] doing statistical work under [[George Alfred Barnard|George Barnard]].\n\nAfter the war Lindley spent some time at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] before returning to Cambridge for a further year of study. From 1948 to 1960 he worked at Cambridge, starting as a demonstrator and leaving as director of the [[Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge|Statistical Laboratory]]. In 1960 Lindley left to take up a new chair at [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth|Aberystwyth]]. In 1967 he moved to [[University College London]]. In 1977 Lindley took early retirement at the age of 54. From then until 1987 he travelled the world as an \"itinerant scholar\", and later continued to write and to attend conferences.  He was awarded the [[Royal Statistical Society]]'s [[Guy Medal]] in Gold in 2002. \n\nLindley first encountered statistics as a set of techniques and in his early years at Cambridge he worked to find a mathematical basis for the subject. His lectures on probability were based on [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov's]] approach which at that time had no following in Britain. In 1954 Lindley met [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] who was also looking for a deeper justification of the ideas of [[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman]], [[Egon Pearson|Pearson]], [[Abraham Wald|Wald]] and [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]]. Both found that justification in [[Bayesian theory]] and they turned into critics of the classical statistical inference they had hoped to justify. Lindley became a great missionary for the Bayesian gospel. The atmosphere of the Bayesian revival is captured in a comment by Rivett on Lindley's move to University College London and the premier chair of statistics in Britain: \"it was as though a Jehovah's Witness had been elected Pope.\"\n\n== Publications ==\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n | quote = Uncertainty is a personal matter; it is not ''the'' uncertainty but ''your'' uncertainty.\n | source = Dennis Lindley, ''Understanding Uncertainty'' (2006)\n | width = 50%\n | align= right\n}}\n* (with [[J.
