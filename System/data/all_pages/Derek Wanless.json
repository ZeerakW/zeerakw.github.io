It is right that members of the Board of Northern Rock have been replaced, though haphazardly, since the company became dependent on liquidity support from the Bank of England. The high-risk, reckless business strategy of Northern Rock, with its reliance on short- and medium-term [[wholesale funding]] and an absence of sufficient insurance and a failure to arrange standby facility or cover that risk, meant that it was unable to cope with the liquidity pressures placed upon it by the freezing of international capital markets in August 2007. Given that the formulation of that strategy was a fundamental role of the Board of Northern Rock, overseen by some directors who had been there since its demutualisation, the failure of that strategy must also be attributed to the Board. The non-executive members of the Board, and in particular the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Risk Committee and the senior non-executive director, failed in the case of Northern Rock to ensure that it remained liquid as well as solvent, to provide against the risks that it was taking and to act as an effective restraining force on the strategy of the executive members.'' <ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmtreasy/56/5602.htm House of Commons - Treasury - Fifth Report]\n</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Key publications==\n* 2007: [http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/kings_fund_publications/our_future.html Our Future Health Secured?
