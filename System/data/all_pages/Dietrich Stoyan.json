Since 1976 at [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|TU Bergakademie Freiberg]], Rektor of that university in \n1991&mdash;1997; he became famous by his statistical research of the diffusion of euro coins in Germany and Europe after the introduction of the [[euro]] in 2002.\n\n==Research==\n===Queueing Theory===\nQualitative theory, in particular inequalities, for [[Queuing theory|queueing systems]] and related [[stochastic model]]s. The books\n*''D. Stoyan: Comparison Methods for Queues and other Stochastic Models. J. Wiley and Sons, Chichester, 1983'' and\n*''A. Mueller and D. Stoyan: Comparison Methods for Stochastic Models and Risks, J. Wiley and Sons, Chichester, 2002''\n\nreport on the results. The work goes back to 1969 when he discovered the [[monotonicity]] of the GI/G/1 waiting times with respect to the convex order.\n\n===Stochastic Geometry===\nStereological formulae, applications for marked point process, development of stochastic models. Successful joint work with [[Joseph Mecke]] led to the first exact proof of the fundamental stereological formulae.\n\nThe book ''Stochastic Geometry and its Applications, by D. Stoyan, W.S. Kendall and J. Mecke reports on the results. The book of 1995 is the key reference for applied stochastic geometry.\n\n===Spatial Statistics===\nStatistical methods for point processes, random sets and many other random geometrical structures such as fibre processes. Results can be found in the 1995 book on stochastic geometry and in the book, ''Fractals, Random Shapes and Point Fields'' by D. and H. Stoyan. (J. Wiley and Sons, Chichester, 1994).\n\nA particular strength of Stoyan are second-order methods.\n\nAt the moment Dietrich Stoyan is working (together with three colleagues) for a new book on point process statistics. He used  packings of hard spheres as models for materials with the aim to solve  mechanical problems for random heterogeneous materials.\n\nStoyan is very active in demonstrating non-mathematicians and  non-statisticians the potential of statistical and stochastic geometrical methods. In particular, he coorganized together \nwith Klaus Mecke conferences where physicists, geometers and  statisticians met. See the books\n*Mecke Klaus R. and Stoyan D.
