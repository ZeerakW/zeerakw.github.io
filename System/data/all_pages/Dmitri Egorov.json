President of the [[Moscow Mathematical Society]] (1923 — 1930).\n\n== Life==\nEgorov held spiritual beliefs to be of great importance, and openly defended the Church against Marxist supporters after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]. He was elected president of the [[Moscow Mathematical Society]] in 1921, and became director of the [[MSU Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics|Institute for Mechanics and Mathematics]] at [[Moscow State University]] in 1923. He also edited the journal ''[[Matematicheskii Sbornik]]'' of the Moscow Mathematical Society.<ref>{{citation|first=Allen|last=Shields|authorlink=Allen Lowell Shields|title=Years Ago: Egorov and Luzin, Part 2|journal=[[Mathematical Intelligencer]]|volume=11|issue=2|year=1989|pages=5–8|doi=10.1007/BF03023816}}.

In 1930 he was arrested and imprisoned as a \"religious sectarian\", and soon after was expelled from the [[Moscow Mathematical Society]]. Upon imprisonment, Egorov began a [[hunger strike]] until he was taken to the prison hospital, and eventually to the house of fellow mathematician [[Nikolai Chebotaryov]] where he died.\n\n==Research work==\nEgorov studied [[potential]] surfaces and triply [[orthogonal]] systems, and made significant contributions to the broader areas of [[differential geometry]] and [[integral equation]]s. His work influenced that of [[Jean Gaston Darboux]] on differential geometry and [[mathematical analysis]]. A theorem in [[real analysis]] and [[integration theory]], [[Egorov's Theorem]], is named after him.<ref>He published a proof of this theorem in the short paper {{Harvnb|Egoroff|1911}}, and the result become widely acknowledged under his name. [[Carlo Severini]] published a proof of the same result a year before, in the paper {{Harvnb|Severini|1910}}: however, the work of Severini was unnoticed until [[Leonida Tonelli]] recalled the attention on it (see the entry about [[Carlo Severini]] for further details).</ref>\n\n==Students==\nEgorov's students included:\n*[[Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov|Pavel Alexandrov]]\n*[[Nikolai Luzin]]\n*[[Ivan Petrovsky]]\n*[[Ivan Privalov]]\n*[[Adolf Yushkevich]]\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Egorov's theorem]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{Citation\n  | last = Kuznetsov\n  | first = P.
