He and his brother, [[Stuart Geman]], are very well known for proposing the [[Gibbs sampling|Gibbs sampler]] and for the first proof of the convergence of the [[simulated annealing|simulated annealing algorithm]],<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = S.

He is a Professor at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] and simultaneously a visiting professor at [[École Normale Supérieure de Cachan]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\nGeman was born in Chicago in 1943.  He graduated from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1965 with a B.A. degree in English Literature and from [[Northwestern University]] in 1970 with a Ph.D. in Mathematics. His dissertation was entitled as \"Horizontal-window conditioning and the zeros of stationary processes.\" He joined [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts - Amherst]] in 1970, where he retired as a distinguished professor in 2001. Thereafter, he became a professor at the [http://www.ams.jhu.edu/ Department of Applied Mathematics] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He has also been a visiting professor at the [[École Normale Supérieure de Cachan]] since 2001. He is a Fellow of both the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]] and the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]].\n\n== Work ==\nD. Geman and J. Horowitz published a series of papers during the late 1970s on local times and occupation densities of stochastic processes. A survey of this work and other related problems can be found in the Annals of Probability.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = D. Geman and J.

It introduces a Bayesian paradigm using Markov Random Fields for the analysis of images. This approach has been highly influential over the last 20 years and remains a rare tour de force in this rapidly evolving field. In another milestone paper,<ref>Y. Amit and D.
