Loeb Professor of [[Statistics]] at [[Harvard University]].  He was hired by Harvard in 1984, and served as chair of the department from 1985-1994.\n\nHe is most well known for the [[Rubin Causal Model]], a set of methods designed for [[causal]] [[inference]] with [[observational data]], and for his methods for dealing with [[missing data]].\n\n== Chronology ==\nAs an undergraduate Rubin attended the accelerated [[Princeton University]] [[PhD]] program where he was one of a cohort of 20 students mentored by the [[physicist]] [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] (the intention of the program was to confirm degrees within 5 years of [[freshman]] [[matriculation]]).  He switched to [[psychology]] and graduated in 1965.  He began graduate school in psychology at Harvard with a [[National Science Foundation]] fellowship, but because his statistics background was considered insufficient, he was asked to take introductory statistics courses.  Rubin felt insulted by this given his background in physics, so he decided to transfer to [[applied math]], as he says in the introduction to ''Matched Sampling for Causal Effects.''{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nHe received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in applied math in 1966, and spent the summer consulting for Princeton [[sociologist]] [[Robert Althauser]] on comparing the achievement of white and black students, where he first used a matching method {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.\n\nRubin became a PhD student again, this time in Statistics under [[William Gemmell Cochran|William Cochran]] at the Harvard Statistics Department.  After graduating from Harvard in 1970, he began working  at the [[Educational Testing Service]] in 1971, and served as a visiting faculty member at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'s new statistics department.  He published his major papers on the Rubin causal model in 1974–1980, and a textbook on the subject with econometrician [[Guido Imbens]] to be published in May, 2015.<ref name=cambridge-imbens-rubin>{{cite web|title=Causal Inference in Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences|url=http://www.cambridge.org/er/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistical-theory-and-methods/causal-inference-statistics-social-and-biomedical-sciences-introduction|website=Cambridge University Press|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=24 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nRubin later moved to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the [[University of Chicago]], and [[Harvard]].\n\n== Rubin causal model ==\n{{Main| Rubin causal model}}\n\nThe Rubin causal model is based on the idea of potential outcomes and the assignment mechanism:  every unit has different potential outcomes depending on their \"assignment\" to a condition.  For instance, someone may have one income at age 40 if they attend a private college and a different income at age 40 if they attend a public college; to measure the causal effect of going to a public versus a private college, the investigator should look at the outcome for the same individual in both alternative futures.  It is obviously impossible to see both potential outcomes at once, and one of the potential outcomes is always missing.  A randomized experiment works by assigning people randomly to (in this case) public or private college; because the assignment was random, the groups are (on average) equivalent, and the difference in income at age 40 can be attributed to the college assignment since that was the only difference between the groups.\n\nThe assignment mechanism is the explanation for why some units received the treatment and others the control.\nIn observational data, there is a non-random assignment mechanism:  in the case of college attendance, people may choose to attend a private versus a public college based on their financial situation, parents' education, relative ranks of the schools they were admitted to, etc.  If all of these factors can be balanced between the two groups of public and private college students, then in Rubin's model the effect of college attendance can be attributed to the college choice.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* DB Rubin, \"My introduction to matched sampling\", in DB Rubin, ''Matched Sampling for Causal Effects'', Cambridge, 2006.\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/donald-b-rubin Rubin's page on Harvard University Statistics Department website]\n*{{MathGenealogy|id=47145}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Rubin, Donald\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = December 22, 1943\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rubin, Donald}}\n[[Category:Winners of the Wilks Memorial Award]]\n[[Category:ISI highly cited researchers]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Survey methodologists]]\n[[Category:Harvard University faculty]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Psychometricians]]\n[[Category:Educational psychologists]]\n[[Category:American psychologists]]\n[[Category:Princeton University alumni]]\n[[Category:1943 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Bayesian statisticians]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Donald Rubin"}}}}
