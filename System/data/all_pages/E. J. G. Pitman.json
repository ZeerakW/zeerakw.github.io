In particular, he is remembered primarily as the originator of the [[Pitman permutation test]], [[Pitman nearness]] and [http://eom.springer.de/E/e035070.htm Pitman efficiency].\n\nPitman was born in Melbourne in 29 October 1897, and attended [[University of Melbourne]], residing at [[Ormond College]], where he graduated with First Class Honours. In 1926 he was appointed [[Professor]] of [[Mathematics]] at the [[University of Tasmania]], which he held until his retirement in 1962.\n\nHe was a founding member and second President of the [[Australian Mathematical Society]]. He was also active within the Statistical Society of Australia, which in 1978 named the Pitman medal in his honour.\n\nHis work ''the Pitman measure of closeness'' or ''Pitman nearness'' concerning the [[exponential family|exponential families]] of [[probability distribution]]s has been studied extensively since the 1980s by [[C. R. Rao]], [[Pranab K. Sen]], and others.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pitman's measure of closeness: A comparison of statistical estimators|first=Pranab K.|last=Sen|authorlink1=Pranab K. Sen|first2=J.
