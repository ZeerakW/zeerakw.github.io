The Savitzes ran an amusement [[Video arcade|arcade]] in downtown Philadelphia. Ed ranked first in his class of 278 students at [[West Philadelphia High School]], and voted most likely to succeed. He won a full [[scholarship]] to study [[economics]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], but dropped out after two years. In 1967, also after two years' study, he quit [[Temple University|Temple University's]] graduate school of music. In 1963, he married his high school girlfriend Judith Widman, who later became a lawyer, specializing in [[family law]]. They were divorced 10 years later. In 1981, his brother Joseph, a lawyer who once served as a Deputy [[Pennsylvania Attorney General]], used [[barbiturates]] to commit suicide.\n\n===Sexual abuse===\nEd Savitz had an apartment on [[Rittenhouse Square]] and for years was known by the male youth of the area through word of mouth as a quick source of cash. From as far back as 1975, he offered teenage boys money, concert tickets and football tickets for their soiled underwear, and various sexual acts including: oral and anal sex, slamming his penis in a door, penis sword fights, urinating on him, vomiting in his mouth and defecating in his mouth through a potty chair. He reportedly kept the [[feces]] in pizza boxes in his apartment. He told the boys to eat [[cheese]] to make the feces taste better.\n\nSavitz mostly targeted boys from the [[Grays Ferry, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Grays Ferry]] neighborhood and even had a St. John Neumann High School yearbook, which he used like a catalogue, circling the pictures of boys he wanted to see and promising referral fees for bringing them to him.\n\n===Arrest===\nSavitz was first arrested in 1978 on an [[indecent assault]] charge. His record was expunged after he completed a rehabilitation program. In 1990, he was found not guilty on charges relating to the purchase of a minor's soiled underwear.\n\nThe neighbors in his high-rise apartment building complained of young boys entering and leaving his apartment at all hours of the day and night. One neighbor described the boys she saw as mostly \"[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] types,\" who wore black leather clothes and chains and had long hair. Savitz told neighbors that he was a social worker, helping the boys.\n\nSavitz's third arrest followed a six-month investigation by the city's sex-crime unit. By early March 1992, investigators had gathered enough evidence to install a [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]] and hidden video camera in his home. On March 25, 1992, detectives watched as Savitz offered to pay two 15-year-old boys for oral sex. Police burst into the apartment and took him into custody. Savitz was charged with crimes of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, [[sexual abuse]] of children, indecent assault, and corrupting the morals of a minor.\n\nPolice found 5,000 photographs of boys and 312 bags of soiled boys' underwear at Savitz's apartment and a rented storage center nearby.\n\nAlthough Savitz tested HIV-positive about a year before his arrest, he continued to have unprotected sex with boys until his arrest. His arrest caused an AIDS scare in the Philadelphia area due to the large number of individuals that he had sexual contact with. AIDS hotlines were flooded with calls after his photo was released.\n\nBail was set for three million dollars and Savitz was released. He was arrested again the next day when bail was raised to twenty million dollars after complaints involving two teenagers were verified.\n\nSavitz died of complications from AIDS in a prison hospice on March 27, 1993, one week before the date his trial was set to begin, April 5, 1993.\n\n===Alleged connection to Jerry Sandusky===\nAfter the [[Penn State sex abuse scandal]], an article in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' featured allegations by one of Savitz's alleged molestation victims, former Philadelphia child prostitute Greg Bucceroni, alleged that in 1979 & 1980 Savitz brought him to a fundraiser near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] for the [[Second Mile Foundation]], which had recently been established by [[Penn State Football|Penn State]] Offensive Coordinator [[Jerry Sandusky]]. Savitz's former attorney claims he is unaware of any communication Savitz ever had with Sandusky.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/i-team/sex-abuse-victim-recalls-horrid-encounter-edward-savitz-associate-jerry-sandusky-article-1.1115909 |title=Sex abuse victim recalls horrid encounter with Edward Savitz, associate of ex-Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky |publisher=NY Daily News |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9E0CE6DD153CF931A35757C0A964958260 Philadelphia Suspect: A Troubled Life]\n* [http://citypaper.net/articles/011896/article002.shtml Suing Uncle Eddie]\n* [http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975260,00.html Uncle Ed's Ugly Secret]\n* [http://www.aegis.org/news/ads/1992/AD920785.html \"American Notes: Uncle Ed's Ugly Secret\"]\n* [http://www.aegis.com/news/wb/2005/WB050806.html Concerns raised about HIV sex prosecutions: Creating 'AIDS criminals' doesn't slow transmission rates, researchers argue]\n* [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F0CE0DC143EF93AA15750C0A964958260 Philadelphian With AIDS Tells of Sex With Many Boys]\n* [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F0CE7DB1E31F93AA15750C0A965958260&n=Top%2fNews%2fHealth%2fDiseases%2c%20Conditions%2c%20and%20Health%20Topics%2fAIDS Executive Accused of Sex With Boys Dies]\n* [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9E0CEFD61039F932A05750C0A964958260 More Say They Are Sex-Case Victims]\n* [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2D9143CF93BA35757C0A964958260&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=2 2 Neighborhoods Linked In Scandal and in Shame]\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Savitz, Eddie\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American businessman\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = February 22, 1942\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = March 27, 1993\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Savitz, Eddie}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:1993 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni]]\n[[Category:American people of Russian-Jewish descent]]\n[[Category:American businesspeople]]\n[[Category:AIDS-related deaths in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:20th-century American businesspeople]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Ed Savitz"}}}}
