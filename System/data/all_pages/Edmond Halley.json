He was the second [[Astronomer Royal]] in Britain, succeeding [[John Flamsteed]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nHalley was born in [[Haggerston]], in east [[London]]. His father, Edmond Halley Sr., came from a [[Derbyshire]] family and was a wealthy soap-maker in London. As a child, Halley was very interested in mathematics. He studied at [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's School]], and from 1673 at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]]. While an undergraduate, Halley published papers on the [[Solar System]] and [[sunspot]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Publications and inventions===\nHalley became an assistant to [[John Flamsteed]], the Astronomer Royal at the Greenwich Observatory, in 1675, and among other things, had the job of assigning what is now called [[Flamsteed number]]s to stars.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn 1676, Halley visited the south Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]] and set up an observatory with a large sextant with telescopic sights to catalogue the stars of the southern hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/halley.htm| author=Ian Ridpath| title=Edmond Halley's southern star catalogue| accessdate=29 June 2012}}</ref> While there he observed a [[transit of Mercury]], and realised that a similar transit of [[Venus]] could be used to determine the absolute size of the Solar System.<ref>Jeremiah Horrocks, William Crabtree, and the Lancashire observations of the transit of Venus of 1639, Allan Chapman 2004 Cambridge University Press [doi:10.1017/S1743921305001225]</ref> He returned to England in May 1678. In the following year he went to Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]) on behalf of the [[Royal Society]] to help resolve a dispute.  Because astronomer [[Johannes Hevelius]] did not use a [[telescope]], his observations had been questioned by [[Robert Hooke]]. Halley stayed with Hevelius and he observed and verified the quality of Hevelius' observations.  In 1679 Halley published the results from his observations on St. Helena as ''Catalogus Stellarum Australium'' which included details of 341 southern stars.<ref name=\"Carter\">{{cite journal | last =Carter | first =Harold B. | title =The Royal Society and the Voyage of HMS Endeavour 1768–71 | journal =Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London | volume =49 | issue =2 | page = 248 | publisher =The Royal Society | location =London, UK | date =July 1995 | jstor =532013|subscription=yes| via=[[JSTOR]] | accessdate =30 August 2014 | doi=10.1098/rsnr.1995.0026}}</ref><ref name=Kanas>{{cite book|last=Kanas|first=Nick|title=Star Maps: History, Artistry, and Cartography (Second Edition)|year=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Chickester, U.K.|isbn=978-1-4614-0916-8|page=122}}</ref> These additions to contemporary [[star map]]s earned him comparison with [[Tycho Brahe]]: e.g. \"the southern Tycho\" as described by Flamsteed. Halley was awarded his M.A. degree at Oxford and elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] at the age of 22.\n\n[[File:Edmond Halley Royal Greenwich Observatory Museum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of Halley ([[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]])]]\nIn 1686, Halley published the second part of the results from his [[Saint Helena|Helenian]] expedition, being a paper and chart on [[trade wind]]s and [[monsoon]]s. The symbols he used to represent trailing winds still exist in most modern day weather chart representations. In this article he identified solar heating as the cause of [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] motions. He also established the relationship between [[barometer|barometric pressure]] and height above sea level. His charts were an important contribution to the emerging field of [[information visualisation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nHalley spent most of his time on lunar observations, but was also interested in the problems of [[gravity]]. One problem that attracted his attention was the proof of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]. In August 1684, he went to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] to discuss this with [[Isaac Newton]], much as [[John Flamsteed]] had done four years earlier, only to find that Newton had solved the problem, at the instigation of Flamsteed with regard to the orbit of comet [[Kirch's Comet|Kirch]], without publishing the solution. Halley asked to see the calculations and was told by Newton that he could not find them, but promised to redo them and send them on later, which he eventually did, in a short treatise entitled, ''On the motion of bodies in an orbit.'' Halley recognised the importance of the work and returned to Cambridge to arrange its publication with Newton, who instead went on to expand it into his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' published at Halley's expense in 1687.<ref>Peter Ackroyd. ''Newton.'' Great Britain:  Chatto and Windus, 2006.</ref> Halley's first calculations with comets were thereby for the orbit of comet Kirch, based on Flamsteed's observations in 1680-1. Although he was to accurately calculate the orbit of the comet of 1682, he was inaccurate in his calculations of the orbit of comet Kirch. They indicated a periodicity of 575 years, thus appearing in the years 531 and 1106, and presumably heralding the death of [[Julius Caesar]] in a like fashion in −44 (45 BCE). It is now known to have an orbital period of circa 10,000 years.\n\nIn 1691, Halley built a [[diving bell]], a device in which the atmosphere was replenished by way of weighted barrels of air sent down from the surface.<ref name=spums_hx>{{cite journal |author=Edmonds, Carl; Lowry, C; Pennefather, John |title=History of diving. |journal=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] Journal |volume=5 |issue=2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5894 |accessdate=17 March 2009}}</ref> In a demonstration, Halley and five companions dived to {{convert|60|ft}} in the [[River Thames]], and remained there for over an hour and a half. Halley's bell was of little use for practical salvage work, as it was very heavy, but he made improvements to it over time, later extending his underwater exposure time to over 4 hours.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.londondivingchamber.co.uk/index.php?id=history&page=4| publisher=London Diving Chamber| title=History: Edmond Halley| accessdate=6 December 2006}}</ref> Halley suffered one of the earliest recorded cases of middle ear [[barotrauma]].\n<ref name=spums_hx/> That same year, at a meeting of the Royal Society, Halley introduced a rudimentary working model of a magnetic [[compass]] using a liquid-filled housing to damp the swing and wobble of the magnetised needle.<ref>Gubbins, David, ''Encyclopedia of Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism'', Springer Press (2007), ISBN 1-4020-3992-1, ISBN 978-1-4020-3992-8, p. 67</ref>\n\nIn 1691 Halley sought the post of [[Savilian Professor of Astronomy]] at Oxford, but, due to being accused of [[atheism]], was opposed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[John Tillotson]], and [[Edward Stillingfleet|Bishop Stillingfleet]].  The post went instead to [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]], who had the support of Isaac Newton.<ref>Derek Gjertsen, ''The Newton Handbook'', ISBN 0-7102-0279-2, pg 250</ref>\n\nIn 1692, Halley put forth the idea of a [[hollow Earth]] consisting of a shell about 500 miles (800&nbsp;km) thick, two inner concentric shells and an innermost core, about the diameters of the planets [[Venus]], [[Mars]], and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Halley, E. | title = An account of the cause of the change of the variation of the magnetic needle; with an hyphothesis of the structure of the internal parts of the earth | journal = Philosophical Transactions of [[Royal Society of London]] | year = 1692 | volume = 16 | pages = 563–578 | url = http://www.archive.org/details/philosophicaltra03royarich | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1686.0107 | issue = 179–191}}</ref> He suggested that atmospheres separated these shells, and that each shell had its own magnetic poles, with each sphere rotating at a different speed. Halley proposed this scheme to explain anomalous compass readings. He envisaged each inner region as having an [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] and being [[luminosity|luminous]] (and possibly inhabited), and speculated that escaping gas caused the [[Aurora Borealis]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Robert Todd|authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll|date=13 February 2006|url=http://skepdic.com/hollowearth.html|title=hollow Earth|work=[[Skeptic's Dictionary]]|accessdate=23 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 1693 Halley published an article on [[Life annuity|life annuities]], which featured an analysis of age-at-death on the basis of the [[Wrocław|Breslau]] statistics [[Caspar Neumann]] had been able to provide. This article allowed the British government to sell life annuities at an appropriate price based on the age of the purchaser. Halley's work strongly influenced the development of [[actuarial science]]. The construction of the life-table for Breslau, which followed more primitive work by [[John Graunt]], is now seen as a major event in the history of [[demography]].\n\nThe [[Royal Society]] censured Halley for suggesting in 1694 that the story of Noah's flood might be an account of a cometary impact.<ref>V.

Napier, ''The Cosmic Serpent'' London: Faber and Faber, 1982.</ref>\n\n[[File:Halley Edmund grave.jpg|right|thumb|Halley's grave]]\n\n===Exploration years===\n\nIn 1698, Halley was given command of the {{HMS|Paramour|1694|2}}, a {{convert|52|ft}} [[pink (ship)|pink]], so that he could carry out investigations in the South Atlantic into the laws governing the [[Magnetic declination|variation of the compass]].  On 19 August 1698, he took command of the ship and, in November 1698, sailed on what was the first purely scientific voyage by an English naval vessel.  Unfortunately problems of [[insubordination]] arose over questions of Halley's competence to command a vessel. Halley returned the ship to England to proceed against officers in July 1699. The result was a mild rebuke for his men, and dissatisfaction for Halley, who felt the court had been too lenient.<ref>{{cite book |last=Halley|first=Edmond|title=The Three Voyages of Edmond Halley in the Paramore, 1698–1701|pages=129–131|year=1982|publisher=Hakluyt Society|location=UK|isbn=0-904180-02-6}}</ref> Halley thereafter received a temporary commission as a Captain in the [[Royal Navy]], recommissioned the ''Paramour'' on 24 August 1699 and sailed again in September 1699 to make extensive observations on the conditions of terrestrial [[magnetism]]. This task he accomplished in a second Atlantic voyage which lasted until 6 September 1700, and extended from 52 degrees north to 52 degrees south. The results were published in ''General Chart of the Variation of the Compass'' (1701). This was the first such chart to be published and the first on which [[Isogon (geomagnetism)|isogonic]], or Halleyan, lines appeared.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Alan|title=Edmond Halley: Charting the Heavens and the Seas|date=12 April 1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford USA|isbn=0198500319|edition=1|url=http://www.abebooks.co.uk/Edmond-Halley-Charting-Heavens-Seas-Alan/11789151926/bd?cm_mmc=gmc-_-gmc-_-PLA-_-v01|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Edmond Halley plaque in Westminster Abbey.jpg|left|thumb|Plaque in South Cloister of [[Westminster Abbey]]]]\n\nThe preface to [[Awnsham Churchill|Awnsham and John Churchill]]'s collection of voyages and travels (1704), supposedly written by John Locke or by Halley, made the link.{{clarify|date=September 2013}}\n\n<blockquote> \"Natural and moral history is embellished with the most beneficial increase of so many thousands of plants it had never before received, so many drugs and spices, such unaccountable diversity.

In 1705, applying [[historical astronomy]] methods, he published ''Synopsis Astronomia Cometicae'', which stated his belief that the comet sightings of 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682 related to the same comet, which he predicted would return in 1758. Halley did not live to witness the comet's return, but when it did, the comet became generally known as [[Halley's Comet]].\n\nBy 1706 Halley had learned Arabic and completed the translation started by [[Edward Bernard]]<ref>M.B. Hall, '[http://books.google.com/books?id=4H2fESItCVIC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154 Arabick Learning in the Correspondence of the Royal Society, 1660–1677]', ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in 17th-Century England'', p.154</ref> of Books V-VII of [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]]'s ''Conics'' from copies found at [[Leiden University Library|Leiden]] and the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford.  He also completed a new translation of the first four books from the original Greek that had been started by the late [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]]. He published these along with his own reconstruction of Book VIII<ref>Michael N.

In doing so, he was following the method described by [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] in ''Optica Promota'' (in which the design of the [[Gregorian telescope]] is also described). It is reasonable to assume Halley possessed and had read this book given that the Gregorian design was the principal telescope design used in astronomy in Halley's day.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wakefield|first1=Julie|last2=Press|first2=Joseph Henry|title=Halley s Quest: A Selfless Genius and His Troubled Paramore|date=2005|publisher=National Academies Press|location=USA|isbn=0309095948|url=http://www.abebooks.co.uk/Halley-Quest-Selfless-Genius-Troubled-Paramore/10235936814/bd?cm_mmc=gmc-_-gmc-_-PLA-_-v01|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref> It is not to Halley's credit that he failed to acknowledge Gregory's priority in this matter. In 1718 he discovered the [[proper motion]] of the \"fixed\" stars by comparing his [[astrometry|astrometric]] measurements with those given in Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]''. [[Arcturus]] and [[Sirius]] were two noted to have moved significantly, the latter having progressed 30 arc minutes (about the diameter of the moon) southwards in 1800 years.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Holberg|first=JB|title=Sirius:Brightest Diamond in the Night Sky|pages=41–42|year=2007|publisher=Praxis Publishing|location=Chichester, UK|isbn=0-387-48941-X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1720, together with his friend the [[antiquarian]] [[William Stukeley]], Halley participated in the first attempt to scientifically date [[Stonehenge]]. Assuming that the monument had been laid out using a magnetic compass, Stukeley and Halley attempted to calculate the perceived deviation introducing corrections from existing magnetic records, and suggested three dates (AD 920, AD 220 and 460 BC), the earliest being the one accepted. These dates were wrong by thousands of years, but the idea that scientific methods could be used to date ancient monuments was revolutionary in its day.<ref>Johnson, Anthony, ''Solving Stonehenge, The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''(Thames & Hudson 2008) ISBN 978-0-500-05155-9</ref>\n\nHalley succeeded [[John Flamsteed]] in 1720 as [[Astronomer Royal]], a position Halley held until his death.\n\nHalley died in 1742 at the age of 85.
