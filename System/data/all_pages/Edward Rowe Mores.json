He was also instrumental in the founding of [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society|The Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorships]] (now commonly known as Equitable Life), and is credited with being the first person to use the professional title ''[[actuary]]'' in relation to [[insurance]].\n\n==Personal life==\nEdward Rowe Mores was born on 24 January 1731 <small>[NS]</small> at Gore Court in [[Tunstall, Kent|Tunstall]] near [[Sittingbourne]] in [[Kent]]. His father Edward Mores (1681–1740) was a member of the gentry, and had been [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of Tunstall for twenty years. His mother was Sarah Windsor, the daughter of a [[City of London|City]] [[merchant]]. He had one sister, Ann-Catherine.\n\nIn 1740, Mores's father died leaving a considerable [[inheritance]], and later the same year he entered the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] in [[London]]. His mother soon remarried, to Richard Bridgman, a London [[grocer]] who was of increasing importance in the [[Grocer's Company]]. Mores entered [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College, Oxford]] in 1746, obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1750, and [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1753.\n\n==Antiquarianism==\nAt Oxford, he was renowned for the range and depth of his learning and for his [[idiosyncrasies]]. He studied [[Latin]], and spoke it almost exclusively to his daughter when she was young. Besides [[mathematics]], he was interested in such diverse studies as [[heraldry]], and was elected a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in 1752.\n\n==The Equitable Society==\nAfter [[James Dodson]]’s death, Mores became the leader of the group which eventually became the [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society|Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship]] in 1762. He specified that the chief official should be called the actuary, which is the earliest known reference to the position as a business concern.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal\n | last = Ogborn\n | first = M.E.\n | year = 1956\n | month = \n | title = '''The Professional Name of Actuary'''\n | journal = Journal of the Institute of Actuaries\n | volume = 82\n | pages = 233–246\n | url = http://www.actuaries.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/25382/0233-0246.pdf\n | format = PDF\n | accessdate = 2006-08-29\n}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Worldcat id|lccn-n82-32203}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Mores, Edward Rowe\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = British scholar and actuary\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1731\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 22 November 1778\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mores, Edward Rowe}}\n<!-- Categories -->\n[[Category:British actuaries]]\n[[Category:People educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood]]\n[[Category:18th-century English mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London]]\n[[Category:1731 births]]\n[[Category:1778 deaths]]\n\n\n{{UK-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Edward Rowe Mores"}}}}
