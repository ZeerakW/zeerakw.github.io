Tufte (1912-1999). He grew up in [[Beverly Hills, California]], where his father was a longtime city official,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://46.105.251.113/Centennial/biographies/Tufte_Edward%20E.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref> and graduated from [[Beverly Hills High School]].<ref name = \"LA01\">Reynolds, Christopher.

He was then hired by [[Princeton University]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson School]], where he taught courses in [[political economy]] and [[data analysis]] while publishing three quantitatively inclined political science books.\n\nIn 1975, while at Princeton, Tufte was asked to teach a statistics course to a group of journalists who were visiting the school to study economics. He developed a set of readings and lectures on [[statistical graphics]], which he further developed in joint seminars he taught with renowned statistician [[John Tukey]], a pioneer in the field of information design. These course materials became the foundation for his first book on information design, ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''.<ref name= \"zachry\">{{Citation | first1 = Mark | last1 = Zachry | first2 = Charlotte | last2 = Thralls | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/s15427625tcq1304_5.pdf | title = An interview with Edward R.

He financed the work by taking out a [[second mortgage]] on his home. The book quickly became a commercial success and secured his transition from political scientist to information expert.<ref name=\"zachry\" />\n\nOn March 5, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] appointed Tufte to the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Recovery and Reinvestment Act's]] Recovery Independent Advisory Panel \"to provide transparency in the use of Recovery-related funds\".<ref name = \"RIAP\">{{Citation | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts-3510 | title = President Obama Announces More Key Administration Posts | publisher = White House Office of the Press Secretary | date = March 5, 2010}}.</ref>\n\n== Work ==\nTufte is an expert in the presentation of [[informational graphics]] such as [[chart]]s and [[diagram]]s, and is a fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]]. He has held fellowships from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] and the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]].\n\nHis work habits are forward-looking and he is intensely critical in the self-editing process. He pulls in and casts out ideas from books, journals, posters, auction catalogs, and other less common sources. He invites others to critique his work in-progress and may nurture dozens of ideas over months in various states of growth and fruition. He deletes almost every photograph he takes. Over time, he deletes most of what he writes on his own forum, ET Notebooks. Every printing of every book corrects numerous small blemishes, ranging from color registration to kerning and hinting.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThis pattern of work is repeated in his sculpture: he digs through sources ranging from other art and other genres (most notably [[Feynman diagrams]]), to flea markets, nuclear power plants, and fields of grass. He is in search of forms and ideas from which to build models, table pieces, and occasionally larger landscape pieces. Even some nominally finished, large scale works are reworked heavily. But at the same time, some random sculptural equivalents of brush strokes or artifacts of a piece's former life are retained, a degree of [[wabi-sabi]], as may be seen in ''Rocket Science'' (circa 2006–9, Hogpen Hill, Connecticut).{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n=== Information design ===\n[[Image:Minard.png|thumb|right|[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s ''Carte Figurative'' illustrates facts related to [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign]].]]\nTufte's writing is important in such fields as [[information design]] and [[visual literacy]], which deal with the visual communication of information.  He coined the word ''[[chartjunk]]'' to refer to useless, non-informative, or information-obscuring elements of quantitative information displays.  Tufte's other key concepts include what he calls the ''lie factor'', the ''data-ink ratio'', and the ''data density'' of a graphic.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Mulrow | first = EJ |year= 2002 | title = The Visual Display of Quantitative Information | journal = [[Technometrics]] | volume =44|issue=4|page =400 |doi=10.1198/tech.2002.s78|ref= harv}}</ref>\n\nHe uses the term \"data-ink ratio\" to argue against using excessive decoration in visual displays of quantitative information.<ref>{{cite book |title=Graph design for the eye and mind |last=Kosslyn |first=Stephen Michael | authorlink =Stephen Kosslyn| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] |year=2006 |page=126 |isbn= 978-0-19-531184-6}}</ref> In ''Visual Display'', Tufte explains, \"Sometimes decorations can help editorialize about the substance of the graphic. But it's wrong to distort the data measures—the ink locating values of numbers—in order to make an editorial comment or fit a decorative scheme.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}{{Page needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nTufte encourages the use of data-rich [[illustration]]s that presented all available data. When such illustrations are examined closely, every [[data point]] has a value, but when they are looked at more generally, only trends and patterns can be observed. Tufte suggests these macro/micro readings be presented in the space of an eye-span, in the high resolution format of the printed page, and at the unhurried pace of the viewer's leisure.\n\nHe uses several historical examples to make his case. These include [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow's]] [[:Image:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|cholera outbreak map]], [[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s [[:Image:Minard.png|''Carte Figurative'']], early [[space debris]] plots, [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'', and [[Maya Lin]]'s [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]]. For instance, the listing of the names of deceased soldiers on the black granite of Lin's sculptural memorial is shown to be more powerful as a chronological list rather than as an alphabetical one. The sacrifice each fallen individual has made is thus highlighted within the overall time scope of the war.{{Sfn | Tufte | 2001b | pp = 43–4}} In ''Sidereus Nuncius'' Galilei presents the nightly observations of the moons of Jupiter in relation to the body itself, intervowen with the two-month narrative record.<ref>{{Citation | last = Tufte | first = Edward R | author-mask = 3 | year = 2006 | title = Beautiful Evidence | place = Cheshire, CT | publisher = Graphics Press | ISBN = 0-9613921-7-7}}</ref>\n\n=== Criticism of PowerPoint ===\nTufte has criticized the way [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] is typically used. In his essay \"The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint,\" Tufte criticizes many aspects of the software:\n* Its use to guide and reassure a presenter, rather than to enlighten the audience;\n* Its unhelpfully simplistic tables and charts, resulting from the low resolution of early computer displays;\n* The [[outliner]]'s causing ideas to be arranged in an unnecessarily deep hierarchy, itself subverted by the need to restate the hierarchy on each slide;\n* Enforcement of the audience's lockstep linear progression through that hierarchy (whereas with handouts, readers could browse and relate items at their leisure);\n* Poor [[typography]] and chart layout, from presenters who are poor designers or who use poorly designed templates and default settings (in particular, difficulty in using [[scientific notation]]);\n* Simplistic thinking—from ideas being squashed into bulleted lists; and stories with beginning, middle, and end being turned into a collection of disparate, loosely disguised points—presenting a misleading facade of the objectivity and neutrality that people associate with science, technology, and \"bullet points\".\n\nTufte cites the way PowerPoint was used by [[NASA]] engineers in the events leading to the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] as an example of the many problems. The software style is designed to [[persuade]] rather than to inform people of technical details.  Tufte's analysis of a NASA PowerPoint slide is included in the [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]]’s report—including an engineering detail buried in small type on a crowded slide with six bullet points, that if presented in a regular engineering [[white paper]], might have been noticed and the disaster prevented.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1 | contribution = Analysis | first = Edward Rolf | last = Tufte | title = Forum}}.</ref><ref name=\"caib\">{{Citation | url = http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter7.pdf | publisher = Columbia Accident Investigation Board | title = Report | volume = 1 |date=August 2003 | page = 15}}.</ref>\n\nInstead, Tufte argues that the most effective way of presenting information in a technical setting, such as an academic seminar or a meeting of industry experts, is by distributing a brief written report that can be read by all participants in the first 5 to 10 minutes of the meeting. Tufte believes that this is the most efficient method of transferring knowledge from the presenter to the audience and then the rest of the meeting is devoted to discussion and debate.<ref>{{Citation | last = Tufte | first = Edward Rolf | url = http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB | title = PowerPoint Does Rocket Science—and Better Techniques for Technical Reports}}.</ref>\n\n=== Small multiple ===\nOne method Tufte encourages to allow quick visual comparison of multiple series is the [[small multiple]], a chart with many series shown on a single pair of axes that can often be easier to read when displayed as several separate pairs of axes placed next to each other. He suggests this is particularly helpful when the series are measured on quite different vertical (''y''-axis) scales, but over the same range on the horizontal ''x''-axis (usually time).\n\n=== Sparkline ===\nAlthough Tufte is said to have invented [[sparkline]]s, in actuality he invented only the name and popularized it as technique.<ref name= bissantz>{{cite web | last=Bissantz|first=Nicolas|title= Sparklines, another masterpiece of Edward Tufte|url = http://www.bissantz.com/sparklines/ | format = blog| publisher= Bissantz & Co |accessdate= 2011-03-20}}</ref> Sparklines are a condensed way to present trends and variation, associated with a measurement such as average [[temperature]] or [[stock market]] activity, often embedded directly in the text; for example: The Dow Jones index for February 7, 2006 [[File:Sparkline dowjones new.svg|alt=sparkline which illustrates the fluctuations in the Down Jones index on February 7, 2006|100px]].<ref name=MSFTsparklines>{{cite web|last=Oppenheimer|first=Diego|title=Sparklines in Excel|url = http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-excel/archive/2009/07/17/sparklines-in-excel.aspx?PageIndex=2 |work= The Microsoft Office Blog|publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref><ref name=frimlinger>{{cite web|last = Rimlinger |first=Fabrice|title= Project Summary|url= http://sourceforge.net/projects/sparklinesforxl/ | work = Sparklines for Microsoft Excel|publisher=SourceForge|accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref> These are often used as elements of a [[small multiple]] with several lines used together. Tufte explains the sparkline as a kind of \"word\" that conveys rich information without breaking the flow of a sentence or paragraph made of other \"words\" both visual and conventional. To date, the earliest known implementation of sparklines was done by interaction designer Peter Zelchenko and programmer Mike Medved in early 1998.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tufte|first1=Edward|title=Microsoft patent claim for \"sparklines in the grid\"|url=http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003Y1}}</ref>\n\n=== Sculpture ===\nBeyond his academic endeavors over the years, Tufte has created sculptures, often large outdoor ones made of metal or stone,<ref name=\"LA01\" /> which were first primarily exhibited on his own rural [[Connecticut]] property. In 2009–10, some of these artworks were exhibited at the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]] in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]], in the one-man show ''Edward Tufte: Seeing Around''.<ref name = AldrichCAM>{{cite web | title = Edward Tufte: Seeing Around|url= http://www.aldrichart.org/exhibitions/past/tufte.php | publisher= Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum| accessdate= 2012-06-03}}</ref> The Tufte sculpture garden in Woodbury, Connecticut is open to the public one day per year.<ref>[http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/ Tufte website]</ref>\n\nIn 2010, \"the man known as 'ET'... opened a gallery, ET Modern, in [[New York City]]'s [[Chelsea Art District]]\"<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127481819 | title = The Many Faces (And Sculptures) of Edward Tufte | publisher = NPR | date = June 5, 2010 | accessdate = 2010-06-06}}.</ref> at 11th Avenue and 20th Street.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003h7&topic_id=1 | first = Edward Rolf | last = Tufte | type = announcement | title = ET Modern gallery opening | accessdate = 2010-06-30}}.</ref> The gallery closed in 2013 \"after 3.5 good years\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Edward Tufte's Twitter feed|url=https://twitter.com/EdwardTufte/status/376420576555851778|website=Twitter|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Works on political economy ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Brody |first1= Richard A. |last2= Tufte |first2= Edward R. |title= Constituent-Congressional Communication on Fallout Shelters: The Congressional Polls |journal= Journal of Communication | volume = 14 | issue = 1 |pages=34–39 |date=March 1964 |doi= 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1964.tb02345.x}}\n*{{cite journal |first1= Paul |last1= Ekman |first2= Edward R. |last2= Tufte |first3= Kathleen | last3 = Archibald | first4 =Richard A |last4= Brody |title= Coping with Cuba: Divergent Policy Preferences of State Political Leaders |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume= 10 |issue= 2 |pages= 180–97 |date=June 1966 |doi=10.1177/002200276601000203}}\n* {{Citation | last = Tufte | first = Edward R. | year = 1968 | title = The Civil Rights Movement and Its Opposition | type = PhD thesis}}.\n*{{cite journal |last =Tufte |first =Edward R. |authormask= 3 |title= Improving Data Analysis in Political Science |journal=World Politics |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=641–54 |date=July 1969 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |jstor=2009670 |doi= 10.2307/2009670}}\n*{{cite journal | last1= Tufte |first1= Edward R. |authormask= 3 |first2= John Shelton |last2= Reed |title= A Note of Caution in Using Variables That Have Common Elements | journal= The Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages=622–6 |date=Winter 1969–1970 |doi= 10.1086/267756}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Tufte |first1=Edward R. |authormask= 3 |first2=Ed L. |last2=Kish |title=Some statistical problems in research design.
