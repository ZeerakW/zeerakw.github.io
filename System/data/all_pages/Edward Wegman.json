He holds a [[Ph.D.]] in [[mathematical statistics]] and is a Fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]], a Senior Member of the [[IEEE]], and past chair of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics. In addition to his work in the field of statistical computing, Wegman [[Wegman report|contributed a report]] to a Congressional hearing on [[climate change]] at the request of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Rep. [[Joe Barton]]. Wegman's report supported criticisms of the methodology of two specific paleoclimate studies into the [[temperature record of the past 1000 years]], and argued that climate scientists were excessively isolated from the statistical mainstream. Subsequently, significant portions of Wegman's report were found to have been copied without attribution from a variety of sources, including Wikipedia, and a publication based on the report was retracted.<ref name=\"throw-away\"/><ref name=\"retracted\"/><ref name=\"wp-copying\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nWegman, a [[St. Louis, Missouri]] native, received a B.S. in mathematics from [[Saint Louis University]] in 1965. He then went to graduate school at the [[University of Iowa]], where he earned an M.S. in 1967 and a Ph.D. in 1968, both in mathematical statistics. He held a faculty position at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] for ten years.  In 1978, Wegman joined the [[Office of Naval Research]], in which he headed the Mathematical Sciences Division.<ref name=ioalum>{{cite web | url = http://www.iowalum.com/daa/wegman.html | publisher = University of Iowa | title = Alumni Association distinguished alumni awards | deadurl=yes}}</ref> Later, Wegman served as the first program director of the Ultra High Speed Computing basic research program for the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]'s Innovative Science and Technology Office.  He joined the faculty of George Mason University in 1986 and developed a master’s degree program in statistical science.<ref name=ioalum/>\n\nWegman is credited with coining the phrase \"computational statistics\" and developing a high-profile research program around the concept that computing resources could transform statistical techniques.  He also has been the associate editor of seven academic journals, a member of numerous editorial boards, and the author of more than 160 papers and five books.  Wegman is a member of the [[American Statistical Association]], a former president of the [[International Association for Statistical Computing]], and a past chairman of the Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics for the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=ioalum/> Wegman received the 2002 Founders Award from the American Statistical Association for \"over thirty years of exceptional service and leadership to the American Statistical Association.\"<ref name=\"throw-away\">{{cite journal | journal = [[American Scientist]] | first1 = Andrew | last1 = Gelman | authorlink1 = Andrew Gelman | first2 = Thomas | last2 = Babsøll | title = To Throw Away Data: Plagiarism as a Statistical Crime | url = http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/to-throw-away-data-plagiarism-as-a-statistical-crime/1 | volume = 101 | issue= 3 | pages = 168}}</ref><ref>[http://www.amstat.org/careers/foundersaward.cfm ASA Founders Award winners]</ref>\n\n== Energy and Commerce hearing & plagiarism allegations ==\n{{main|Wegman report}}\n\nIn 2006, Republican Congressman [[Joe Barton]] chose Wegman to assist the House [[Energy and Commerce Committee]] in its inquiry criticizing the multi-proxy paleoclimate reconstructions which had been dubbed the \"[[Hockey stick graph]]\".
