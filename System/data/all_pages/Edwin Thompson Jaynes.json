Jaynes strongly promoted the interpretation of [[probability theory]] as an extension of [[logic]].\n\nIn 1963, together with [[Fred Cummings]], he [[Scientific modelling|modeled]] the evolution of a [[Two-level system|two-level atom]] in an electromagnetic field, in a fully quantized way. This model is known as the [[Jaynes–Cummings model]].\n\nA particular focus of his work was the construction of logical principles for assigning [[prior probability]] distributions; see the [[principle of maximum entropy]], the principle of transformation groups<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jaynes, E.T. |authormask=1 |title=Prior Probabilities |journal=IEEE Trans. on Systems Science and Cybernetics |volume=4  |issue=3 |pages=227 |date=September 1968 |doi=10.1109/TSSC.1968.300117 |url=http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/prior.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Jaynes, E.T. |authormask=1 |title=The Well-Posed Problem |journal=Found.
