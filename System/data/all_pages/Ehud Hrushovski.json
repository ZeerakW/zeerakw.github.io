He is a Professor of Mathematics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He earned his PhD from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1986 under [[Leo Harrington]] He was Professor of Mathematics at the \n[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] until 1998 before he went to Jerusalem. \nHis father, [[Benjamin Harshav]] (né Hruszowski; 1928-2015),<ref>Archives, [[Ghetto Fighters' House]]</ref> was a [[literary theorist]], a Yiddish and Hebrew [[poet]] and a translator, [[Professor]] at [[Yale University]] and [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[comparative literature]].\n\nHrushovski is well known for many fundamental and important contributions to [[model theory]], in particular in the branch that has become known as [[geometric model theory]], and its applications.\nHis PhD thesis revolutionized stable model theory (a part of model theory arising from the stability theory introduced by [[Saharon Shelah]]). Shortly afterwards he found counterexamples to the [[Trichotomy Conjecture]] of [[Boris Zilber]] and his method of proof has become well known as Hrushovski constructions and found many other applications since.\n\nIn 1996, Hrushovski found a proof the geometric [[Mordell–Lang conjecture]] in all characteristics using model theory. This deep proof was a landmark in logic and geometry. He has had many other famous results in model theory and applications to [[Diophantine geometry]].\n\nHe is a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (2007), and [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] (2008).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Zariski geometry]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ehud/ Ehud Hrushovski at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Hrushovski, Ehud\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = \n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Israeli mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = September 30, 1959\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = \n| DATE OF DEATH     = \n| PLACE OF DEATH    = \n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hrushovski, Ehud}}\n[[Category:Israeli mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Logicians]]\n[[Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty]]\n[[Category:Members of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]\n[[Category:American Jews]]\n[[Category:Israeli Jews]]\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Model theorists]]\n[[Category:Tarski lecturers]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Ehud Hrushovski"}}}}
