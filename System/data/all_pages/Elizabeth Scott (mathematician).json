Her family moved to [[Berkeley, California]] when she was 4 years old.  She attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she studied mathematics and [[astronomy]]. There were few options for further study in astronomy, as the field was largely closed to women at the time, so she completed her graduate studies in mathematics. She received her Ph.D. in 1949, and received a permanent position in the Department of Mathematics at Berkeley in 1951.\n\nShe wrote over 30 papers on astronomy and 30 on weather modification research analysis, incorporating and expanding the use of statistical analyses in these fields. She also used statistics to promote equal opportunities and equal pay for female academics.\n\nIn 1957 Elizabeth Scott noted a bias in the observation of [[Galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy clusters]]. She noticed that for an observer to find a very distant cluster, it must contain brighter than normal galaxies and must also contain a large number of galaxies. She proposed a correction formula to adjust for (what came to be known as) the [[Scott effect]].<ref>http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb4t1nb2bd&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00061&toc.depth=1&toc.id=</ref><ref>http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/escott.htm</ref>\n\nThe Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies awards a prize in her honour to female statisticians.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/escott.htm \"Elizabeth Scott\", Biographies of Women Mathematicians], [[Agnes Scott College]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Scott, Elizabeth\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = November 23, 1917\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = December 20, 1988\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scott, Elizabeth}}\n[[Category:1917 births]]\n[[Category:1988 deaths]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Women statisticians]]\n[[Category:Women mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Elizabeth Scott (mathematician)"}}}}
