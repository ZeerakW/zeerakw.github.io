Classic [[parametric statistics|parametric methods]], like [[Pearson correlation coefficient]], or [[least squares method]] produce comparable results only for comparable distribution types (in practice [[multivariate normal distribution]] is being assumed). Parametric [[statistical test]]s are derived from distribution assumptions. Classic methods fail if the input data contain strong [[outliers]], and interpretation of their results should be different for different distribution types. In practice, the underlying assumptions are often not checked, moreover they are always violated – there is no normal distribution in the real world, because every real variable is limited (for example people cannot be –170&nbsp;cm or +2&nbsp;km tall), and the normal distribution implies positive [[probability density function|probability density]] for every [[real number]]. In most cases the real distribution is [[skewness|skewed]] or [[discrete distribution|discrete]], which doesn't prevent people from using normal distribution methods. The extend of this violation can be measured, but its maximum accepted level is just a convention, not mathematics. The parametric methods always work out of their conditions of use. However, their results are othen considered valid, which leads to \"scientific\" validation of false hypothesis. For the reasons mentioned above, Elżbieta Pleszczyńska is a strong advocate of [[explorative data analysis]]<ref>{{cite book|first=Janusz B.|last=Książyk|editor=Olaf Matyja |editor2=Elżbieta Pleszczyńska |editor3=Marek Wiech|title=Analiza danych medycznych i demograficznych przy użyciu programu GradeStat|place=Warszawa|year=2005|publisher=Instytut Podstaw Informatyki PAN, [[Children’s Memorial Health Institute|Centrum Zdrowia Dziecka]]|isbn=83-922508-0-X|pages=7 (preface by prof.
