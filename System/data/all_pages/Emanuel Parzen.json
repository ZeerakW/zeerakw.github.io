He has worked and published on [[signal detection theory]] and [[time series]] analysis, where he pioneered the use of [[kernel density estimation]] (also known as the [[Parzen window]]<ref name=\"parzen_1962\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Parzen | first1 = E. | authorlink = Emanuel Parzen| title = On Estimation of a Probability Density Function and Mode | doi = 10.1214/aoms/1177704472 | journal = [[The Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]| volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 1065 | year = 1962 | jstor = 2237880| pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> in his honor).

He then matriculated to [[Harvard University|Harvard]], where he earned his undergraduate degree in mathematics in 1949. From there, he went on to [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], earning his master and doctorate degrees in mathematics in 1951 and 1953, respectively. His dissertation, \"On Uniform Convergence of Families of Sequences of Random Variables\", was written under [[Michel Loève]].\n\nParzen went directly into academia after graduate school, first serving as a research scientist in the physics department and assistant professor of mathematical statistics at [[Columbia University]]. He left there in 1956 for [[Stanford University]], where he stayed for the next 14 years. During this time, he wrote what has become one of the classical texts in probability theory.<ref name=\"parzen_1960\">Parzen, E.
