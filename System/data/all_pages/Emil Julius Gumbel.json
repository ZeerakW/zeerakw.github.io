He was Professor of [[Mathematical Statistics]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]].\n\nFollowing the murder of a friend, he attended the trial where he saw that the judge completely ignored evidence against the [[Sturmabteilung|Brown Shirts Nazis]]. Horrified, he ardently investigated many similar political murders that had occurred and published his findings in ''Four Years of Political Murder'' in 1922. In 1928, he published ''Causes of Political Murder'' and also tried to create a political group to counter Nazism. Gumbel was also one of the 33 signers of the 1932 ''[[Dringender Appell]]''.\n\nAmong the Nazi's most-hated public intellectuals, he was forced out of his position in Heidelberg in 1932.  Gumbel then moved to France, where he taught in Paris and Lyon, and then to the United States in 1940.  He taught at the École Libre Des Hautes Études in Paris and at the New School for Social Research and Columbia University in New York City until his death in 1966.<ref>Much of this discussion is drawn from an account in ''The Lady Tasting Tea,'' a book about the history of Statistics and biographies of Statisticians.</ref>\n\nAs a mathematician, Gumbel was instrumental in the development of [[extreme value theory]], along with [[Leonard Tippett]] and [[Ronald Fisher]]. In 1958, Gumbel published a key book on the topic: ''[[heavy-tailed distribution|Statistics of Extremes]]''. He derived and analyzed the [[probability distribution]] that is now known as the [[Gumbel distribution]] in his honor.\n\nWhen he died, Gumbel's papers were made a part of ''The Emil J. Gumbel Collection, Political Papers of an Anti-Nazi Scholar in Weimar and Exile''. These papers include reels of microfilm that document his activities against the Nazis.<ref>More biographical details of Gumbel's opposition to Nazism can be found in [http://www.lexisnexis.com/documents/academic/upa_cis/11130_EmilJ.Gumbel.pdf The Emil J.
