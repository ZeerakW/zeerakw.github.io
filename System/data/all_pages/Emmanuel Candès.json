He returned to Stanford in 2009.\n\n==Research==\nCandès' early research concerned [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear approximation theory]]. In his Ph.D. thesis,<ref name=\"mg\"/> he developed generalizations of [[wavelet]]s called [[curvelet]]s and ridgelets that were able to capture higher order structures in signals. This work has had significant impact in [[image processing]] and [[Multiscale modeling|multiscale analysis]], and earned him the Popov prize in approximation theory in 2001.<ref name=\"popov\">[http://www.math.sc.edu/~popov/Candes.html The Vasil A.

Many researchers have since contributed to this field, which has brought us the idea of a camera that can record pictures while needing only one sensor,<ref>{{citation\n | last = Mackenzie | first = Dana\n | contribution = Compressed sensing makes every pixel count\n | isbn = 978-0-8218-4478-6\n | pages = 114–127\n | publisher = [[American Mathematical Society]]\n | title = What's Happening in the Mathematical Sciences\n | url = http://www.ams.org/happening-series/hap7-pixel.pdf\n | year = 2009}}.</ref><ref>{{citation\n | last = Sullivan | first = Laurie\n | date = October 11, 2006\n | journal = [[InformationWeek]]\n | title = Megapixel Images Created With One Pixel: The camera replaces the traditional digital pixel grid with an array of tiny micromirrors\n | url = http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_tech/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=193300073}}.</ref> and tools for designing distributed sensors that can communicate cheaply.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 2001 Candès received an [[Sloan Fellowship|Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship]].<ref name=\"nips\"/> He was awarded the James H.

He was also presented with the Dannie Heineman Prize by the [[Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities|Academy of Sciences at Göttingen]] in 2013.
