His research examines the different [[Family#Family in the West|types of families]] worldwide and how there are matching beliefs, ideologies and political systems, and the historical events involving these things.\n\n== Life and works ==\nBorn in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], [[Yvelines]], Emmanuel Todd is the grandson of the writer [[Paul Nizan]], the son of the journalist Olivier Todd ([[:fr:Olivier Todd|fr]]), and the father of the historian David Todd. Todd is of Jewish descent.<ref>http://www.rwevans.co.uk/~r/rwevans/wevansnet04/item0042A.htm</ref> The historian [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], who pioneered [[microhistory]], was a friend of the family and gave him his first history book. Aged 10, Todd wanted to become an [[archeologist]]. He studied at the ''[[Lycée international de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]'', where he was a member of the [[French Communist Party|Communist Youth]]. He then studied [[political science]] at the [[Paris Institute of Political Studies]] and went on to prepare a [[Ph.D.]] in [[history]] at the [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity college]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] with [[Peter Laslett]]. He defended his doctoral thesis on ''Seven peasant communities in pre-industrial Europe. A comparative study of French, Italian and Swedish rural parishes (18th and early 19th century)'' in 1976.\n\nTodd attracted attention in 1976 when he, at 25 years old, [[Predictions of Soviet collapse|predicted the fall of the Soviet Union]], based on indicators such as increasing [[infant mortality]] rates: ''{{lang|fr|La chute finale: Essais sur la décomposition de la sphère Soviétique}}'' (The Final Fall: An Essay on the Decomposition of the Soviet Sphere).\n\nHe then worked for a time in the literary service of ''[[Le Monde]]'' daily, then returned to research, working on the hypothesis of a determination of [[ideologies]] and religious or political beliefs by familial systems (''Explanation of Ideology: Family Structure & Social System'', 1983). He then wrote, among other books, ''The Invention of Europe'' (1990) and ''The Fate of Immigrants'' (1994), in which he defended the \"French model\" of integration of immigrants.\n\n[[File:Emmanuel Todd-Scan-090129-0012c.jpg|thumb|Emmanuel Todd]]\nTodd was opposed to the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in the [[French referendum, 1992|1992 referendum]]. In 1995, he wrote a memo for the [[Fondation Saint-Simon]], which became famous &mdash; the media thereafter attributed to him the paternity of the expression \"''{{lang|fr|fracture sociale}}''\" (social crack or social gap), used by [[Jacques Chirac]] during the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 electoral campaign]] in order to distinguish himself from his rival [[Édouard Balladur]]. Todd, however, has rejected this paternity,<ref name=Rendez-vous>[http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/19/pour-todd-pas-de-choc-mais-un-rendez-vous-des-civilisations Pour Todd, pas de \"choc\" mais un \"rendez-vous des civilisations\"], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 19 September 2007 {{fr icon}}</ref> and attributed the expression to [[Marcel Gauchet]].\n\nIn ''[[After the Empire: The Breakdown of the American Order]]'' (2001), Todd claims that many indices that he has examined (economic, demographic and ideological) show both that the [[United States]] has outlived its status as sole [[superpower]], and that much of the rest of the world is becoming \"modern\" (declining birth rates etc.) far more rapidly than predicted. Controversially, he proposes that many US foreign policy moves are designed to mask what he sees as the redundancy of the United States. In his analysis, Putin's Russia emerges as probably a more trustworthy partner in today's world than the US. The book has been much-read although many of its more original ideas have been received with scepticism.\n\nIn spite of his opposition to the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, Todd expressed himself in favour of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in the [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|referendum of 2005]], advocating a protectionist framework at the European level for the future policies of the Union.\n\nIn ''A Convergence of Civilizations: The Transformation of Muslim Societies Around the World '' (2007), written with fellow demographist [[Youssef Courbage]], Todd criticized [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s thesis of a [[clash of civilizations]], pointing instead to indices of a convergence in styles of life and in values among civilisations.\n\nThroughout much of this time he was working on \"The Origins of Family Systems\", which he has described as \"his life's work\". The first volume was published in 2011. He describes how in researching the book he has, over 40 years, \"read more anthropology monographs than most anthropologists.\" He has described the book as \"completed\", with only the stage of writing up its second and final volume remaining.<ref>http://www.rfi.fr/emission/20110918-1-emmanuel-todd-auteur-origine-systemes-familiaux</ref>\n\nHis 2015 work ''Qui est Charlie? Sociologie d'une crise réligieuse'' has become his most controversial and his most popular essay. In it, he claims that the 11th of January, 2015 marches to show solidarity with the victims of recent terrorist attacks in France were not an expression of positive French values but of racist and reactionary elements in France. The work has been accused by politicians of a seeming willingness to look aside from the reality of Islamist terrorism <ref>http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/21/in-france-the-fight-over-charlie-hebdos-legacy-is-getting-ugly-emmanuel-todd/</ref><ref>http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/qu-est-il-arrive-a-emmanuel-todd_1678725.html</ref> while some readers accuse it of a reliance on unsupported a priori arguments while failing to consider other, more relevant political factors.<ref>http://www.slate.fr/story/101827/ou-est-charlie-cartes-emmanuel-todd.</ref> The book aroused copious and emotional hostility, including a critique by the [[Prime Minister of France]], [[Manuel Valls]].<ref>http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/05/07/manuel-valls-nous-devons-resister-au-pessimisme-ambiant_4629245_3224.html</ref> Todd claims to have written quickly, partly out of frustration and not in a purely academic style, though he defends his arguments' basis in his decades of French demographic research.<ref>http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/28/emmanuel-todd-the-french-thinker-who-wont-toe-the-charlie-hebdo-line</ref>\n\n== Quotes ==\n{{Cquote|The idea that, under the pretext that a country is democratic, its citizens, after an internal debate, can legitimately decide to bomb the citizens of another country is an idea that will end up killing democracy.
