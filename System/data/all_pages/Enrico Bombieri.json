He won a [[Fields Medal]] in 1974.<ref>[http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1974.1/ICM1974.1.ocr.pdf Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, 1974]</ref>\n\n==Career==\nBombieri published his first mathematical paper in 1957 when he was 16 years old. In 1963 at age 22 he earned his first degree (Laurea) in mathematics from the [[Università degli Studi di Milano]] under the supervision of Giovanni Ricci and then studied at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] with [[Harold Davenport]].\n\nBombieri was an assistant professor (1963–1965) and then a full professor (1965–1966) at the [[University of Cagliari|Università di Cagliari]], at the [[Università di Pisa]] in 1966–1974, and then at the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] in 1974–1977. From Pisa he emigrated in 1977 to the USA, where he became a professor at the  ''School of Mathematics'' at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. In 2011 he became professor emeritus.\n\nBombieri's research in [[number theory]], [[algebraic geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis]] have earned him many international prizes — a [[Fields Medal]] in 1974 and the [[Balzan Prize]] in 1980. In 2010 he received the [[King Faisal International Prize]] (jointly with [[Terence Tao]]).<ref>[http://www.kff.com/ King Faisal Foundation], - retrieved 2010-01-11.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Bombieri and Tao Receive King Faisal Prize|journal=Notices of the AMS|date=May 2010|volume=57|issue=5|pages=642–643|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201005/rtx100500642p.pdf}}</ref> He was a [[plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1974 at Vancouver. He is a member, or foreign member, of several learned academies, including the [[French Academy of Sciences]] (elected 1984), the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (elected 1996), and the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]] (elected 1976).<ref>[http://www.lincei.it/modules.php?name=Soci&file=scheda&func=Soci_scheda&Id=438 Scheda socio], from the website of [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei|Accademia dei Lincei]] (elected 1976)</ref>\nIn 2002 he was made ''Cavaliere di Gran Croce al Merito della Repubblica Italiana''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Torno Armando|title=BOMBIERI Il re dei numeri che ha conquistato il mondo|newspaper=Corriere della Serra|date=28 May 2002|page=35|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2002/maggio/28/BOMBIERI_dei_numeri_che_conquistato_co_0_0205285644.shtml|language=it}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem]] is one of the major applications of the [[large sieve method]]. It improves [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions|Dirichlet's theorem]] on [[prime number]]s in [[arithmetic progression]]s, by showing that by averaging over the modulus over a range, the mean error is much less than can be proved in a given case. This result can sometimes substitute for the still-unproved [[generalized Riemann hypothesis]].\n\nIn 1969 Bombieri, [[Ennio de Giorgi|De Giorgi]], and [[Enrico Giusti|Giusti]] solved [[Bernstein's problem]].<ref>{{Citation | last1=Bombieri | first1=Enrico | last2=De Giorgi | first2=Ennio | last3=Giusti | first3=Enrico | title=Minimal cones and the Bernstein problem | doi=10.1007/BF01404309 | mr=0250205 | year=1969 | journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] | issn=0020-9910 | volume=7 | pages=243–268}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Bombieri developed the technique known as the \"asymptotic sieve\".<ref name=\"asymp-sieve\">E.

Married with a grown daughter, he is a gourmet cook and a serious painter: He carries his paints and brushes with him whenever he travels. Still, mathematics never seems far from his mind. In a recent painting, Bombieri, a one-time member of the Cambridge University chess team, depicts a giant chessboard by a lake.
