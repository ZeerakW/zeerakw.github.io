Now part of modern-day [[Libya]], Cyrene had been founded by the Greeks centuries earlier, and became the capital of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)]], a country of five cities: Cyrene, Arsinde, [[Berenice]], Ptolemias, and [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica]]. [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Cyrene in 332 BC, and following his death in 323 BC its rule was given to one of his generals, [[Ptolemy I Soter]], the founder of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Under Ptolemaic rule the economy prospered, based largely on the export of horses and [[silphium]], a plant used for rich seasoning and medicine.<ref name=\"Roller, Duane W 2010\"/> Cyrene became a place of cultivation, where knowledge blossomed. Like any young Greek, Eratosthenes would have studied in the local gymnasium, where he would have learned physical skills and social discourse as well as reading, writing, arithmetic, poetry, and music.<ref>Bailey, Ellen. 2006. \"Eratosthenes of Cyrene.\" Eratosthenes Of Cyrene 1–3. Book Collection Nonfiction: High School Edition.</ref>\n\nEratosthenes went to Athens to further his studies. There he was taught [[Stoicism]] by its founder, [[Zeno of Citium]], in philosophical lectures on living a virtuous life.<ref>Rist, J.M. \"Zeno and Stoic Consistency,\" in Phronesis. Vol. 22, No. 2, 1977.</ref> He then studied under [[Ariston of Chios]], who led a more [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynical]] school of philosophy. He also studied under the head of the [[Platonic Academy]], who was [[Arcesilaus of Pitane]]. His interest in Plato led him to write his very first work at a scholarly level, ''Platonikos'', inquiring into the mathematical foundation of Plato's philosophies.<ref>Chambers, James T. \"Eratosthenes of Cyrene.\" in ''Dictionary Of World Biography: The Ancient World January'' 1998: 1–3.</ref> Eratosthenes was a man of many perspectives and investigated the art of poetry under [[Callimachus]].<ref>Bailey, Ellen. \"Eratosthenes of Cyrene,\" in Eratosthenes of Cyrene 1–3. Book Collection Nonfiction: High School Edition, 2006.</ref> He had talent as a most imaginative poet. He wrote poems: one in [[hexameter]]s called ''Hermes'' illustrating the god's life history; and another, in [[elegiac]]s, called ''Erigone'', describing the suicide of the Athenian maiden [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)]].<ref>Chambers, James T. \"Eratosthenes of Cyrene\" in ''Dictionary Of World Biography: The Ancient World'' (January 1998): 1–3.</ref> He wrote ''Chronographies'', a text that scientifically depicted dates of importance, beginning with the [[Trojan War]]. This work was highly esteemed for its accuracy: [[George Syncellus]] was later able to preserve from ''Chronographies'' a list of 38 kings of the [[Egyptian Thebes]]. Eratosthenes also wrote ''Olympic Victors'', a chronology of the winners of the Olympic Games. It is not known when he wrote his works, but they highlighted his abilities.\n\nThese works and his great poetic abilities led the pharaoh [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] to seek to place him as a librarian at the [[Library of Alexandria]] in the year 245 BC. Eratosthenes, then thirty years old, accepted Ptolemy's invitation and traveled to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life. Within about five years he became Chief Librarian, a position that the poet [[Apollonius Rhodius]] had previously held. As head of the library Eratosthenes tutored the children of Ptolemy, including [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] who became the fourth Ptolemaic pharaoh. He expanded the library's holdings: in Alexandria all books had to be surrendered for duplication. It was said that these were copied so accurately that it was impossible to tell if the library had returned the copy or the original.\nHe sought to maintain the reputation of the Library of Alexandria against competition from the [[Pergamum]]. Eratosthenes created a whole section devoted to the examination of Homer, and acquired original works of great tragic dramas of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]].<ref>Chambers, James T. \"Eratosthenes of Cyrene\" Dictionary Of World Biography: The Ancient World, January 1998.</ref>\n\nEratosthenes made several important contributions to [[mathematics]] and [[science]], and was a friend of [[Archimedes]]. Around 255&nbsp;BC, he invented the [[armillary sphere]]. In ''On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies'', [[Cleomedes]] credited him with having calculated the [[Equator#Exact length of the Equator|Earth's circumference]] around 240 BC, using knowledge of the angle of [[Solar elevation angle|elevation]] of the [[Sun]] at noon on the [[summer solstice]] in Alexandria and on [[Elephantine]] Island near [[Syene]] (now [[Aswan]], Egypt).\n\nEratosthenes believed there was good and bad in every nation and criticized [[Aristotle]] for arguing that humanity was divided into Greeks and [[barbarian]]s, and that the Greeks should keep themselves racially pure.<ref>* p439 Vol. 1 William Woodthorpe Tarn ''Alexander the Great''.

The sunbeams shown as two rays hitting the ground at Syene and Alexandria. Angle of sunbeam and the gnomons (vertical sticks) is shown at Alexandria which allowed Eratosthenes' estimates of radius and circumference of Earth.]]\n\nEratosthenes calculated the [[circumference]] of the [[Earth]] without leaving Egypt. Eratosthenes knew that at [[Noon#Solar noon|local noon]] on the summer solstice in the Ancient Egyptian city of [[Swenet]] (known in ancient Greek as Syene, and now as Aswan) on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the Sun would appear at the [[zenith]], directly overhead. He knew this because he had been told that the shadow of someone looking down a deep well in Syene would block the reflection of the Sun at noon off the water at the bottom of the well. Using a [[gnomon]], he measured the Sun's angle of elevation at noon on the solstice in Alexandria, and found it to be 1/50th of a circle (7°12') south of the [[zenith]]. He may have used a compass to measure the angle of the shadow cast by the Sun.<ref name=\":6\">[http://todaslascosasdeanthony.com/2012/07/03/eratosthenes-earth-circumference/ How did Eratosthenes measure the circumference of the Earth?]</ref> Assuming that the Earth was spherical (360°), and that Alexandria was due north of Syene, he concluded that the [[meridian arc]] distance from Alexandria to Syene must therefore be 1/50th of a circle's circumference, or 7°12'/360°.\n\nHis knowledge of the size of Egypt was founded on the work of many generations of [[surveying]] trips. Pharaonic bookkeepers gave a distance between Swenet and Alexandria of 5,000 stadia. Some say this distance was corroborated by inquiring about the time that it took to travel from Syene to Alexandria by camel. Carl Sagan says that Eratosthenes [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8cbIWMv0rI paid a man to walk and measure the distance]. He rounded the result to a final value of 700 stadia per degree, which implies a circumference of 252,000 stadia. Some claim Eratosthenes used the Egyptian stade of 157.5 meters, which would imply a circumference of 39,690&nbsp;km, an error of 1.6%,  but the 185 meter Attic stade is the most commonly accepted value for the length of the stade used by Eratosthenes in his measurements of the Earth,<ref>[http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/convergence/eratosthenes-and-the-mystery-of-the-stades-how-long-is-a-stade Eratosthenes and the Mystery of the Stades – How Long Is a Stade?]</ref> which imply a circumference of 46,620&nbsp;km, an error of 16.3%. It is unlikely, however, that Eratosthenes got an accurate measurement of the circumference of the Earth, given three errors in the assumptions he made:<ref name=\":6\" />\n# That Alexandria and Syene lie on the same meridian.\n# That the distance between Alexandria and Syene is 5000 stades.\n# That the Earth is a perfect sphere.\n\nIf we repeat Eratosthenes' calculation with more accurate data, the result is 40,074&nbsp;km, which is 66&nbsp;km different (0.16%) from the currently accepted circumference of the Earth.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nSeventeen hundred years after Eratosthenes' death, while [[Christopher Columbus]] studied what Eratosthenes had written about the size of the Earth, he chose to believe that the Earth's circumference was much smaller.  Had Columbus set sail knowing that Eratosthenes' larger circumference value was more accurate, he would have known that the place where he made landfall was not Asia, but rather a [[New World]].<ref>Gow, Mary.

In the Library of Alexandria he had access to various travel books, which contained various items of information and representations of the world that needed to be pieced together in some organized format.<ref>Smith, Sir William. \"Eratosthenes\", in ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology''. Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Library, 2005.</ref> In his three-volume work ''Geography'' ({{lang-grc-gre|''Geographika''}}), he described and mapped his entire known world, even dividing the Earth into five climate zones:<ref>Morris, Terry R. \"Eratosthenes of Cyrene.\" in ''Encyclopedia Of The Ancient World''. November 2001.</ref> two freezing zones around the pole, two temperate zones, and a zone encompassing the equator and the tropics.<ref>2011. \"Eratosthenes.\" Hutchinson's Biography Database 1.</ref> He had invented geography. He created terminology that is still used today. He placed grids of overlapping lines over the surface of the Earth. He used parallels and meridians to link together every place in the world. It was now possible to estimate one's distance from remote locations with this network over the surface of the Earth. In the ''Geography'' the names of over 400 cities and their locations were shown: this had never been achieved before.<ref name=\"Roller, Duane W 2010\"/>  Unfortunately, his ''Geography'' has been lost to history, but fragments of the work can be pieced together from other great historians like [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Polybius]], [[Strabo]], and [[Marcianus]].\n\n* The first book was something of an introduction and gave a review of his predecessors, recognizing their contributions that he compiled in the library. In this book Eratosthenes denounced [[Homer]] as not providing any insight into what he now described as geography. His disapproval of Homer's topography angered many who believed the world depicted in the Odyssey to be legitimate.<ref name=\"Chambers, James T 1998\"/><ref>Eckerman, Chris. Review of (D.W.) Roller 'Eratosthenes' Geography. Fragments Collected and Translated, with Commentary and Additional Material. The Classical Review. 2011.</ref> He also commented on the ideas of the nature and origin of the Earth: he had thought of Earth as an immovable globe; while on its surface was a place that was changing. He had hypothesized that at one time the [[Mediterranean]] was a vast lake that covered the countries that surrounded it; and had only become connected to the ocean to the west when a passage had opened up sometime in its history.\n* In the second book is his discovery about the circumference of the Earth. This is where, according to Pliny, \"The world was grasped.\" Eratosthenes described his famous story of the well in Syene, described above. This book would now be considered a text on [[mathematical geography]].\n* His third book of the ''Geography'' contained [[political geography]]. He cited countries and used parallel lines to divide the map into sections, to give accurate descriptions of the realms. This was a breakthrough, and can be considered the beginning of geography.<ref name=Smith2005>Smith, Sir William. \"Eratosthenes,\" in A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology. Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Library, 2005.</ref>\n\n== Other achievements ==\n\nEratosthenes was described by the [[Suda Lexicon]] as a Πένταθλος (Pentathlos) which can be translated as \"All-Rounder\", for he was skilled in a variety of things: He was a true polymath. He was nicknamed Beta, because he was great at many things and tried to get his hands on every bit of information, but never achieved the highest rank in anything, so much so that [[Strabo]] accounts Eratosthenes as a mathematician among geographers, and a geographer among mathematicians.<ref>Dicks, D.R. \"Eratosthenes,\" in Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1971.</ref>\n\n* [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Preparation for the Gospel|Preparatio Evangelica]]'' includes a brief chapter of three sentences on celestial distances ([http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_15_book15.htm Book XV], Chapter 53). He states simply that Eratosthenes found the distance to the Sun to be \"{{lang|grc|σταδίων μυριάδας τετρακοσίας καὶ ὀκτωκισμυρίας}}\" (literally \"of [[Stadia (length)|stadia]] [[myriad]]s 400 and 80,000\") and the distance to the Moon to be 780,000 stadia. The expression for the distance to the Sun has been translated either as 4,080,000 stadia (1903 translation by E. H. Gifford), or as 804,000,000 stadia (edition of Edouard des Places, dated 1974–1991). The meaning depends on whether Eusebius meant 400 myriad plus 80,000 or \"400 and 80,000\" myriad. With a stade of 185 meters, 804,000,000 stadia is 149,000,000 kilometers, approximately the distance from the Earth to the Sun.\n\n* Eratosthenes also calculated the Sun's diameter. According to Macrobious, Eratosthenes made the diameter of the Sun to be about 27 times that of the Earth.<ref name=Smith2005/> The actual figure is approximately 109 times.<ref>[http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/5-How-large-is-the-Sun-compared-to-Earth-]</ref>\n\n* During his time at the Library of Alexandria, Eratosthenes devised a calendar using his predictions about the [[ecliptic]] of the Earth. He calculated that there are 365 days in a year and that every fourth year there would be 366 days.<ref>Greek Scholar's Work Shows Usefulness of Measurement.\" Manawatu Standard, June 19, 2012., 07, Newspaper Source Plus</ref>\n\n* He was also very proud of his solution for [[Doubling the Cube]]. His motivation was that he wanted to produce catapults. Eratosthenes constructed a mechanical line drawing device to calculate the cube, called the mesolabio. He dedicated his solution to King Ptolemy, presenting a model in bronze with it a letter and an epigram.<ref>Zhumud, Leonid. Plato as \"Architect of Science\". in ''Phonesis''.

This algorithm is known in mathematics as the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]].\n\nIn mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes (Greek: κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους), one of a number of [[Generating primes#Prime sieves|prime number sieves]], is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite, ''i.e.'', not prime, the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated starting from that prime, as a sequence of numbers with the same difference, equal to that prime, between consecutive numbers. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime.\n\n== Works ==\n\nEratosthenes was one of the most pre-eminent scholarly figures of his time, and produced works covering a vast area of knowledge before and during his time at the Library. He wrote on many topics&nbsp;— geography, mathematics, philosophy, chronology, literary criticism, grammar, poetry, and even old comedies. Unfortunately, there are only fragments left of his works after the [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria]].<ref name=Dicks1971>Dicks, D.R. \"Eratosthenes\", in ''Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography''.
