Bernstein Distinguished Professor of Economics at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] and a Professor of Finance at the [[Kenan-Flagler Business School]] .\n\n==Biography==\nGhysels was born in [[Brussels]], Belgium, as the son of Pierre Ghysels (a civil servant) and Anna Janssens (a homemaker). He completed his undergraduate studies in economics (Supra Cum Laude) at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] in 1979.  He obtained a Fulbright Fellowship from the [[Hoover Foundation]], [[Belgian American Educational Foundation]] in 1980, and finished his PhD at the [[Kellogg Graduate School of Management]] of [[Northwestern University]] in 1984.\n\nGhysels is a fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]] and co-founded with [[Robert Engle]] the [http://www.nyu.edu/sofie/ Society for Financial Econometrics (SoFiE)]. He is also\nco-editor of the [http://jfec.oxfordjournals.org/ Journal of Financial Econometrics].\n\nIn 2008-2009 Ghysels was resident scholar at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]], and has since been a regular visitor of the bank as well as several other central bank institutions around the world working mostly on topics pertaining to [[Mixed data sampling]] regression models and filtering methods.\n\nGhysels is also a research fellow at CIRANO, Extramural Fellow at CentER - [[Tilburg University]], research affiliate at the Volatility Institute - [[New York University]] [[Stern School of Business]] and in 2011 Fernand Braudel Senior Fellow at [[European University Institute]], Florence, Italy.\n\n==Research==\nGhysels' most recent research focuses on '''Mixed data sampling (MIDAS)''' regression models and filtering methods with applications in finance and other fields. He has also worked on diverse topics such as seasonality in economic times series, Generalized Method of Moment estimation and testing of asset pricing models, time varying betas, estimation of risk neutral and objective probability measures for the purpose of option pricing, among many other topics.\n\n[[Mixed data sampling]] or MIDAS regressions are [[econometric]] regression models can be viewed in some cases as substitutes for the [[Kalman filter]] when applied in the context of mixed frequency data.\n\n==Publications==\nRecent work on [[Mixed data sampling]] (MIDAS) includes:\n\n*Andreou, E, Eric Ghysels and A.
