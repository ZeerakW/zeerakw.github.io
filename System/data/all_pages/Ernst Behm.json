In 1856 he began work at ''Petermanns Geographischen Mitteilungen'' in [[Gotha]], a [[German language]] journal of [[geography]] founded by [[August Heinrich Petermann]] (1822-1878).\n\nIn 1866 he became editor of ''Geographische Jahrbuch'' (Geographic Annals), and from 1872, with [[Hermann Wagner (geographer)|Hermann Wagner]] (1840&ndash;1929), edited the geographical/statistical review, ''Die Bevölkerung der Erde''. Starting in 1876 he headed the editorial staff of the statistical section of the ''Gothaischen Hofkalenders'', and in 1878, following the death of Petermann, he became editor of ''Petermanns Geographischen Mitteilungen''.\n\nIn 1872 Behm published an article (''Beweise für die Identität des Lualaba mit dem Congo''), which scientifically demonstrated that the [[Lualaba River|Lualaba]] was a [[headstream]] of the [[Congo River]]. This claim was later confirmed as factual by explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] in 1877.\n\n== References ==\n* ''This article is based on a translation of an article from the [[German Wikipedia]]'', namely: [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]] (ADB).
