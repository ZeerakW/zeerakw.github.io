Jewish cemetery in Wroclaw (street Lotnicza).]]\n'''Ernst Steinitz''' (13 June 1871 – 29 September 1928) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]].\n\n== Biography ==\nSteinitz was born in [[Laurahütte]] ([[Siemianowice Śląskie]]), [[Silesia Province|Silesia]], [[German Empire|Germany]] (now in [[Poland]]), the son of Sigismund Steinitz, a Jewish coal merchant, and his wife Auguste Cohen; he had two brothers. He studied at the [[University of Breslau]] and the [[University of Berlin]], receiving his Ph.D. from Breslau in 1894. Subsequently, he took positions at Charlottenberg (now the [[Technical University of Berlin]]), Breslau, and the [[University of Kiel]], Germany, where he died in 1928. Steinitz married Martha Steinitz and had one son.\n\n== Mathematical works ==\nSteinitz's 1894 thesis was on the subject of [[projective configuration]]s; it contained the result that any abstract description of an [[incidence structure]] of three lines per point and three points per line could be realized as a configuration of straight lines in the Euclidean plane with the possible exception of one of the lines. His thesis also contains the\nproof of [[König's theorem (graph theory)|König's theorem]] for regular bipartite graphs, phrased in the language of configurations.\nIn 1910 Steinitz published the very influential paper ''Algebraische Theorie der Körper'' ([[german language|German]]: Algebraic Theory of Fields, [[Crelle's Journal]] (1910), 167–309). In this paper he axiomatically studies the properties of [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and defines important concepts like [[prime field]], [[perfect field]] and the [[transcendence degree]] of a [[field extension]]. Steinitz proved that every field has an [[algebraic closure]]. He also made fundamental contributions to the theory of [[polyhedra]]: [[Steinitz's theorem]] for polyhedra is that the 1-[[skeleton (topology)|skeletons]] of convex polyhedra are exactly the 3-[[k-connected graph|connected]] [[planar graph]]s. His work in this area was published posthumously as a 1934 book, ''Vorlesungen über die Theorie der Polyeder unter Einschluss der Elemente der Topologie'',<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tucker, A.
