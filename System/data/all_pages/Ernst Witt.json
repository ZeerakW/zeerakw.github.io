He was born on the island of [[Als Island|Als]] (German: ''Alsen''). Shortly after his birth, he and his parents moved to [[China]], and he did not return to [[Europe]] until he was nine.\n\nAfter his schooling, Witt went to the [[University of Freiburg]] and the [[University of Göttingen]]. He joined the [[Nazi party]] and was an active party member.<ref>According to Schappacher (letter in Mathematical Intelligencer 1996) it was most certainly him and not [[Oswald Teichmüller]], who attended [[Emmy Noether]]'s private seminar held in her house while wearing his [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]-uniform.</ref> Witt completed his Ph.D. at the University of Göttingen in 1934 with [[Emmy Noether]] and later became a lecturer. He was then a member of a team led by [[Helmut Hasse]].\n\nFrom 1937 until 1979, he taught at the [[University of Hamburg]]. He died in Hamburg in 1991.\n\n==Work==\nWitt's work has been highly influential. His invention of the [[Witt vector]]s clarifies and generalizes the structure of the [[p-adic number]]s. It has become fundamental to [[p-adic Hodge theory]].\n\nWitt was the founder of the theory of [[quadratic forms]] over an arbitrary [[Field (mathematics)|field]]. He proved several of the key results, including the [[Witt's theorem|Witt cancellation theorem]]. He defined the [[Witt group#Ring structure|Witt ring]] of all quadratic forms over a field, now a central object in the theory.\n\nThe [[Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem]] is basic to the study of [[Lie algebra]]s. In [[algebraic geometry]], the [[Hasse-Witt matrix]] of an [[algebraic curve]] over a [[finite field]] determines the cyclic [[étale morphism|étale]] coverings of degree ''p'' of a curve in characteristic ''p''.\n\nIn the 1970s, Witt claimed that in 1940 he discovered what would eventually be named the \"[[Leech lattice]]\" many years before [[John Leech (mathematician)|John Leech]] discovered it in 1965, but Witt did not publish his discovery and the details of exactly what he did are unclear; see his collected works {{harv|Witt|1998|pp=328–329}}.\n\n__NOTOC__\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of things named after Ernst Witt]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*{{Citation | last1=Kersten | first1=Ina | title=Ernst Witt 1911-1991 | journal=Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung | volume=95 | year=1993 | pages=166-180 | url=https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/jb_dmv/JB_DMV_095_4.pdf}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Witt | first1=Ernst | author1-link=Ernst Witt | editor1-last=Kersten | editor1-first=Ina | title=Collected papers.
