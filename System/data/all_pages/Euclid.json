He was active in [[Alexandria]] during the reign of [[Ptolemy I|Ptolemy&nbsp;I]] (323–283 BC). His ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' is one of the most influential works in the [[history of mathematics]], serving as the main textbook for teaching [[mathematics]] (especially [[geometry]]) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century.<ref>Ball, pp. 50–62.</ref><ref>Boyer, pp. 100–19.</ref><ref>Macardle, et al.

The date, place and circumstances of both his birth and death are unknown and may only be estimated roughly relative to other figures mentioned alongside him. He is rarely mentioned by name by other Greek mathematicians from Archimedes onward, who usually call him \"ὁ στοιχειώτης\" (\"the author of Elements\").<ref>Heath (1981), p. 357</ref> The few historical references to Euclid were written centuries after he lived, by [[Proclus]] c. 450 AD and [[Pappus of Alexandria]] c. 320 AD.<ref>Joyce, David. ''Euclid''. Clark University Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/Euclid.html]</ref>\n\nProclus introduces Euclid only briefly in his ''Commentary on the Elements''. According to Proclus, Euclid belonged to [[Plato]]'s \"persuasion\" and brought together the ''Elements'', drawing on prior work by several pupils of Plato (particularly [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] and [[Philip of Opus]].) Proclus believes that Euclid is not much younger than these, and that he must have lived during the time of [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]] because he was mentioned by [[Archimedes]] (287–212&nbsp;BC). Although the apparent citation of Euclid by Archimedes has been judged to be an interpolation by later editors of his works, it is still believed that Euclid wrote his works before those of Archimedes.<ref>Proclus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JZEHj2fEmqAC&pg=PA88&vq=euclid&dq=proclus+commentary+elements&source=gbs_search_s&cad=0#PPR30,M1 p. XXX]</ref><ref name=\"MCS\">''[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Euclid.html Euclid of Alexandria]''</ref><ref>The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive.</ref>\n\nProclus later retells a story that, when [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]] asked if there was a shorter path to learning geometry than Euclid's  ''Elements'', \"Euclid replied there is no royal road to geometry.\"<ref>Proclus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JZEHj2fEmqAC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 57]</ref> This anecdote is questionable since it is similar to a story told about [[Menaechmus]] and [[Alexander the Great]].<ref>Boyer, p. 96.</ref>\n\nIn the only other key reference to Euclid, Pappus briefly mentioned in the fourth century that [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] \"spent a very long time with the pupils of Euclid at Alexandria, and it was thus that he acquired such a scientific habit of thought\" c. 247–222&nbsp;BC.<ref>Heath (1956), p. 2.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~cherlin/History/Papers1999/schmarge.html|title=Conic Sections in Ancient Greece}}</ref>\n\nA detailed biography of Euclid is given by Arabian authors, mentioning, for example, a birth town of Tyre. This biography is generally believed to be completely fictitious.<ref name=\"MCS\" />\n\nBecause the lack of biographical information is unusual for the period (extensive biographies are available for most significant Greek mathematicians for several centuries before and after Euclid), some researchers have proposed that Euclid was not, in fact, a historical character and that his works were written by a team of mathematicians who took the name Euclid from the historical character [[Euclid of Megara]] (compare [[Bourbaki]]). However, this hypothesis is not well accepted by scholars and there is little evidence in its favor.<ref name=\"MCS\" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Les livres arithmétiques d'Euclide|author=Jean Itard|year=1962}}</ref>\n\n== ''Elements'' ==\n[[File:Oxyrhynchus papyrus with Euclid's Elements.jpg|right|thumb|250px|One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's ''Elements'', found at [[Oxyrhynchus]] and dated to circa AD 100 ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29|P.

The only reference that historians rely on of Euclid having written the ''Elements'' was from Proclus, who briefly in his ''Commentary on the Elements'' ascribes Euclid as its author.\n\nAlthough best known for its geometric results, the ''Elements'' also includes [[number theory]]. It considers the connection between [[perfect numbers]] and [[Mersenne primes]] (known as the [[Euclid–Euler theorem]]), the [[Euclid's theorem|infinitude of prime numbers]], [[Euclid's lemma]] on factorization (which leads to the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] on uniqueness of [[integer factorization|prime factorizations]]), and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.\n\nThe geometrical system described in the ''Elements'' was long known simply as ''[[geometry]]'', and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as ''[[Euclidean geometry]]'' to distinguish it from other so-called ''[[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]'' that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Other works ==\n<!--Linked from [[Optics]]-->\n[[File:Euclid Dodecahedron 1.svg|thumb|Euclid's construction of a regular [[dodecahedron]].]]\n[[File:Cube to dodecahedron 240px.gif|thumb|Construction of a dodecahedron by placing faces on the edges of a cube.]]\n\nIn addition to the ''Elements'', at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day. They follow the same logical structure as ''Elements'', with definitions and proved propositions.\n* ''[[Data (Euclid)|Data]]'' deals with the nature and implications of \"given\" information in geometrical problems; the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the ''Elements''.\n* ''On Divisions of Figures'', which survives only partially in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation, concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given [[ratio]]s. It is similar to a third-century AD work by [[Heron of Alexandria]].\n* ''[[Catoptrics]]'', which concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors. The attribution is held to be anachronistic however by J J O'Connor and E F Robertson  who name [[Theon of Alexandria]] as a more likely author.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Theon.html |title=Theon article at their institution |publisher=History.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref>\n* ''Phaenomena'', a treatise on [[spherical astronomy]], survives in Greek; it is quite similar to ''On the Moving Sphere'' by [[Autolycus of Pitane]], who flourished around 310 BC.\n\n[[File:EuclidStatueOxford.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Statue in honor of Euclid in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]\n* ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' is the earliest surviving Greek treatise on perspective. In its definitions Euclid follows the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by [[Emission theory (vision)|discrete rays which emanate from the eye]]. One important definition is the fourth: \"Things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal.\" In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. Proposition 45 is interesting, proving that for any two unequal magnitudes, there is a point from which the two appear equal. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's ''Optics'', along with his ''Phaenomena'', in the ''Little Astronomy'', a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the ''Syntaxis'' (''Almagest'') of [[Claudius Ptolemy]].\n\nOther works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.\n* ''Conics'' was a work on [[conic section]]s that was later extended by [[Apollonius of Perga]] into his famous work on the subject. It is likely that the first four books of Apollonius's work come directly from Euclid. According to Pappus, \"Apollonius, having completed Euclid's four books of conics and added four others, handed down eight volumes of conics.\" The Conics of Apollonius quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid's work was already lost.\n* ''[[Porism]]s'' might have been an outgrowth of Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is controversial.\n* ''Pseudaria'', or ''Book of Fallacies'', was an elementary text about errors in [[reasoning]].\n* ''Surface Loci'' concerned either [[Locus (mathematics)|loci]] (sets of points) on surfaces or loci which were themselves surfaces; under the latter interpretation, it has been hypothesized that the work might have dealt with [[Quadric|quadric surfaces]].\n* Several works on [[mechanics]] are attributed to Euclid by Arabic sources. ''On the Heavy and the Light'' contains, in nine definitions and five propositions, Aristotelian notions of moving bodies and the concept of specific gravity. ''On the Balance'' treats the theory of the lever in a similarly Euclidean manner, containing one definition, two axioms, and four propositions. A third fragment, on the circles described by the ends of a moving lever, contains four propositions. These three works complement each other in such a way that it has been suggested that they are remnants of a single treatise on mechanics written by Euclid.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Axiomatic method]]\n* [[Euclid's orchard]]\n* [[Euclidean algorithm]]\n* [[Euclidean geometry]]\n* [[Euclidean relation]]\n* [[Extended Euclidean algorithm]]\n* [[List of topics named after Euclid]]\n* ''[[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29]]''\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Artmann, Benno (1999).
