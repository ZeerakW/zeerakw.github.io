There are many Slutsky analogs in [[theory of the firm|producer theory]].\n\nHe is less well known by Western economists than some of his contemporaries, due to his own changing intellectual interests as well as external factors forced upon him after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917.  His seminal paper in Economics, and some argue his last paper in Economics rather than probability theory, was published in 1915 (''Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore'').<ref name=\"Slutsky1915\">{{cite journal | author= Slutsky, E. E.| title= Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore | journal= Giornale degli Economisti | year= 1915| volume= 51| issue= July| pages= 1–26; }}</ref>  [[Paul Samuelson]] noted that until 1936, he had been entirely unaware of Slutsky's 1915 \"masterpiece\" due to [[World War I]] and the paper's Italian language publication.  [[R. G. D. Allen]] did the most to propagate Slutsky's work on consumer theory in published papers in 1936 and 1950.<ref name=\"Barnett2004\">{{cite journal | author= Barnett, Vincent | title= E. E.

D. Kondratiev]], [[Leonid Kantorovich|L. V. Kantorovich]], or [[Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky]].  There are eponymous concepts such as the Slutsky equation, the Slutsky diamond, the Slutsky matrix, and the Slutsky-Yule effect, and a journals-literature search conducted on his name for the years 1980-1995 yielded seventy-nine articles directly using some aspect of Slutsky’s work... Moreover, many microeconomics textbooks contain prominent mention of Slutsky’s contribution to the theory of consumer behavior, most notably the Slutsky equation, christened by [[John Hicks]] as the ‘Fundamental Equation of Value Theory'. Slutsky’s work is thus an integral part of contemporary [[mainstream economics]] and [[econometrics]], a claim that cannot really be made by any other Soviet economist, perhaps even by any other Russian economist.\"<ref name=\"Barnett2004\"/>\n\nIn the 1920s Slutsky turned to working on probability theory and stochastic processes, but in 1927 he published his second famous article on economic theory, 'The Summation of Random Causes as a Source of Cyclical Processes'. This opened up a new approach to business cycle theory by hypothesising that the interaction of chance events could generate periodicity when none existed initially.<ref name=\"Barnett2004\"/>\n\n==Mathematical statistics work==\nSlutsky's later work was principally in [[probability theory]] and the theory of [[stochastic processes]]. He is generally credited for the result known as [[Slutsky's theorem]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |last=Barnett |first=Vincent |year=2006 |title=Chancing an Interpretation: Slutsky's Random Cycles Revisited |journal=European Journal of the History of Economic Thought |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=411–432 |doi=10.1080/09672560600875596 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Barnett |first=Vincent |year=2011 |title=E.E.
