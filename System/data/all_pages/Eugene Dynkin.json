The [[Dynkin diagram]], the [[Dynkin system]], and [[Dynkin's lemma]] are named for him.\n\n==Biography ==\nDynkin lived in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] until 1935, when his family was exiled to [[Kazakhstan]].<ref name=pxiii>{{harvtxt|Dynkin|2000|p=xiii}}</ref> Two years later, when Dynkin was 13, his father disappeared in the [[Gulag]].<ref name=dyn80/><ref name=pxiii/>\n\n===Moscow University===\nAt the age of 16, in 1940, Dynkin was admitted to [[Moscow University]]. He avoided military service in [[World War II]] because of his poor eyesight, and received his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in 1945 and his [[Ph.D.]] in 1948. He became an assistant professor at Moscow, but was not awarded a \"chair\" until 1954 because of his political undesirability. His academic progress was made difficult due to his father's fate, as well as Dynkin's Jewish origin; the special efforts of [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], his Ph.D. supervisor, made it possible for Dynkin to progress through graduate school into a teaching position.<ref name=pxiii/>\n\n===USSR Academy of Sciences===\nIn 1968, Dynkin was forced to transfer from the Moscow University to the [[Central Economic Mathematical Institute]] of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=dyn80/>  He worked there on the theory of [[economic growth]] and [[economic equilibrium]].\n\n===Cornell===\nHe remained at the Institute until 1976, when he emigrated to the [[United States]].<ref name=dyn80>{{cite journal|mr=1309461|last1=Vvedenskaya|first1=N.

A. Dmitriev, solved a problem on the [[eigenvalue]]s of [[Stochastic matrix|stochastic matrices]]. This problem was raised at Kolmogorov's seminar on Markov chains, while both Dynkin and Dmitriev were undergraduates.<ref name=p385/>\n\n===Lie Theory===\nWhile Dynkin was a student at Moscow University, he attended [[Israel Gelfand]]'s seminar on [[Lie group]]s. In 1944, Gelfand asked him to prepare a survey on the structure and classification of [[Semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple Lie groups]], based on the papers by [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden]]. Dynkin found the papers difficult to read, and in an attempt to better understand the results, he invented the notion of a [[Root system#Positive roots and simple roots|\"simple root\"]] in a [[root system]]. He represented the pairwise angles between these simple roots in the form of a [[Dynkin diagram]]. In this way he obtained a cleaner exposition of the classification of complex semisimple Lie algebras.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dynkin|2000|p=xiii,7}}</ref> Of Dynkin's 1947 paper \"Structure of semisimple Lie algebras\", [[Bertram Kostant]] wrote: {{quote|In this paper, using only elementary mathematics, and starting with almost nothing, Dynkin, brilliantly and elegantly developed the structure and machinery of semisimple Lie algebras. What he accomplished in this paper was to take a hitherto esoteric subject, and to make it into beautiful and powerful mathematics.|[[Bertram Kostant]]|\"Selected papers\", p. 363}}\n\nDynkin's 1952 influential paper \"Semisimple subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras\", contained large tables and lists, and studied the subalgebras of the [[Simple Lie group|exceptional Lie algebras]].\n\n===Probability theory===\nDynkin is considered one of the founders of the modern theory of [[Markov process]]es. The results obtained by Dynkin and other participants of his seminar at Moscow University were summarized in two books. The first of these, \"Theory of Markov Processes\", was published in 1959, and laid the foundations of the theory.\n\nDynkin's one-hour talk at the 1962 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Stockholm]], was delivered by Kolmogorov, since prior to his emigration, Dynkin was never permitted to travel to [[Western world|the West]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Dynkin|2000|p=388}}</ref>  This talk was titled \"Markov processes and problems in analysis\".\n\n==Prizes and awards==\n*Prize of the Moscow Mathematical Society, 1951\n*Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Fellow, 1962\n*American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Fellow, 1978\n*National Academy of Sciences of the USA, Member, 1985<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nas.nasonline.org/site/Dir/38308266?pg=vprof&mbr=1002587&returl=http%3A%2F%2Fnas.nasonline.org%2Fsite%2FDir%2F38308266%3Fpg%3Dsrch%26view%3Dbasic&retmk=search_again_link|title=Eugene Dynkin|publisher=NAS}}</ref>\n*American Mathematical Society, [[Leroy P.
