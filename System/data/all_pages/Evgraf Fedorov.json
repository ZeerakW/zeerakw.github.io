The family later moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]. From the age of fifteen he was deeply interested in the theory of [[polytope]]s, which later became his main research interest. He was a distinguished graduate of the [[Saint Petersburg Mining Institute|Gorny Institute]], which he joined at the age of&nbsp;26.\n\nHe contributed to the identification of [[Periodic Graph (Geometry)#Obtaining periodicity|conditions under which a group of Euclidean motions must have a translational subgroup whose vectors span the Euclidean space]]. His best-known result is his 1891 proof concerns the [[Wallpaper group]], showing that there are \nonly 17 possible tilings of the plane<ref>E.

In 1895, he became a professor of geology at the Moscow Agricultural Institute (now the [[Timiryazev Academy]]). Fedorov died from pneumonia in 1919 during the [[Russian Civil War]] in [[Petrograd]], [[RSFSR]].\n\n==Publications==\n*His first book, \"Basics of Polytopes\", was finished in 1879 and published in 1885. It offers a classification of [[polytopes]] and derives [[Fedorov polytopes]], congruent polytopes that can completely fill [[space]].\n*He wrote the classic \"The symmetry of regular systems of figures\" in 1891,<ref>E. S. Fedorov (1891) \"''Симмтрія правильныхъ системъ фигуръ''\" (\"Simmetriia pravil'nykh sistem figur\") [The symmetry of regular systems of figures], ''Zapiski Imperatorskogo S.

The same year the equivalent results were presented by German mathematician [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies|Schönflies]]. Fedorov and [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies|Schönflies]] had been intensively discussing the subject during their work, so the results can be somehow considered as joint ones, though [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies|Schönflies]] noted Fedorov priority for some major ideas.\n\n*He published his classic work \"The theodolite method in mineralogy and petrography\" in 1893.<ref name=\"Kunz\">Kunz, George Frederick and [[Edgar T.
