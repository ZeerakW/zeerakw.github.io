His 1872 [[Erlangen program|Erlangen Program]], classifying geometries by their underlying symmetry [[group (mathematics)|groups]], was a hugely influential synthesis of much of the mathematics of the day.\n\n==Life==\nFelix Klein was born on 25 April 1849 in [[Düsseldorf]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Snyder, Virgil|authorlink=Virgil Snyder|title=Klein's Collected Works|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|Bull.

Klein's mother was Sophie Elise Klein (1819–1890, [[Name at birth|née]] Kayser).<ref>{{cite book|author=Rüdiger Thiele|title=Felix Klein in Leipzig: mit F.

At that time, [[Julius Plücker]] held Bonn's chair of mathematics and experimental physics, but by the time Klein became his assistant, in 1866, Plücker's interest was geometry. Klein received his doctorate, supervised by Plücker, from the University of Bonn in 1868.\n\nPlücker died in 1868, leaving his book on the foundations of [[line geometry]] incomplete. Klein was the obvious person to complete the second part of Plücker's ''Neue Geometrie des Raumes'', and thus became acquainted with [[Alfred Clebsch]], who had moved to Göttingen in 1868. Klein visited Clebsch the following year, along with visits to [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]]. In July 1870, at the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he was in Paris and had to leave the country. For a short time, he served as a medical orderly in the [[Prussian army]] before being appointed lecturer at Göttingen in early 1871.\n\n[[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]] appointed Klein professor in 1872, when he was only 23.<ref>{{cite book|editor=[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]]|title=Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640–1940|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC&pg=PA546|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-045744-4|page=546}}</ref> In this, he was strongly supported by Clebsch, who regarded him as likely to become the leading mathematician of his day. Klein did not build a school at Erlangen where there were few students, and so he was pleased to be offered a chair at [[Munich]]'s Technische Hochschule in 1875. There he and [[Alexander von Brill]] taught advanced courses to many excellent students, including,  [[Adolf Hurwitz]], [[Walther von Dyck]], [[Karl Rohn]], [[Carl Runge]], [[Max Planck]], [[Luigi Bianchi]], and [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]].\n\nIn 1875 Klein married Anne Hegel, the granddaughter of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].<ref>Chislenko, Eugene; Tschinkel, Yuri. [http://www.ams.org/notices/200708/tx070800960p.pdf \"The Felix Klein Protocols\"], ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'', August 2007, Volume 54, Number 8, pp. 960–970.</ref>\n\nAfter five years at the Technische Hochschule, Klein was appointed to a chair of [[geometry]] at [[Leipzig]]. There his colleagues included [[Walther von Dyck]], Rohn, [[Eduard Study]] and [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]]. Klein's years at Leipzig, 1880 to 1886, fundamentally changed his life. In 1882, his health collapsed; in 1883–1884, he was plagued by depression. Nonetheless his research continued; his seminal work on hyperelliptic sigma functions dates from around this period, being published in 1886 and 1888.\n\nKlein accepted a chair at the [[University of Göttingen]] in 1886. From then until his 1913 retirement, he sought to re-establish Göttingen as the world's leading mathematics research center. Yet he never managed to transfer from Leipzig to Göttingen his own role as the leader of a school of [[geometry]]. At Göttingen, he taught a variety of courses, mainly on the interface between mathematics and physics, such as [[mechanics]] and [[potential theory]].\n\nThe research center Klein established at Göttingen served as a model for the best such centers throughout the world. He introduced weekly discussion meetings, and created a mathematical reading room and library. In 1895, Klein hired [[David Hilbert]] away from [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]]; this appointment proved fateful, because Hilbert continued Göttingen's glory until his own retirement in 1932.\n\nUnder Klein's editorship, ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' became one of the very best mathematics journals in the world. Founded by Clebsch, only under Klein's management did it first rival then surpass ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' based out of the [[University of Berlin]]. Klein set up a small team of editors who met regularly, making democratic decisions. The journal specialized in [[complex analysis]], [[algebraic geometry]], and [[invariant theory]] (at least until Hilbert killed the subject). It also provided an important outlet for [[real analysis]] and the new [[group theory]].\n\nIn 1893 in Chicago, Klein was a keynote speaker at the International Mathematical Congress held as part of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].<ref>{{cite book|editor=Case, Bettye Anne|title=A Century of Mathematical Meetings|chapter=''Come to the Fair: The Chicago Mathematical Congress of 1893'' by David E. Rowe and Karen Hunger Parshall|year=1996|publisher=American Mathematical Society|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnkYqxyWGz8C&pg=PA64}}</ref> Thanks in part to Klein's efforts, Göttingen began admitting women in 1893. He supervised the first Ph.D. thesis in mathematics written at Göttingen by a woman; she was [[Grace Chisholm Young]], an English student of [[Arthur Cayley]]'s, whom Klein admired. In 1897 Klein became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001270 |title=Felix C.

In 1905, he played a decisive role in formulating a plan recommending that [[analytic geometry]], the rudiments of differential and integral [[calculus]], and the [[Function (mathematics)|function]] concept be taught in secondary schools.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Gary McCulloch|editor2=David Crook|title=The Routledge International Encyclopedia of Education|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dCMuAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA373|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-85358-9|page=373}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor1=Alexander Karp|editor2=Gert Schubring|title=Handbook on the History of Mathematics Education|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MYy9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA499|year=2014|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-9155-2|pages=499–500}}</ref> This recommendation was gradually implemented in many countries around the world. In 1908, Klein was elected president of the [[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]] at the Rome [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Alexander Karp|editor2=Gert Schubring|title=Handbook on the History of Mathematics Education|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MYy9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA503&q=%22Felix%20Klein%20as%20its%20first%20president%22|year=2014|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-9155-2|page=503}}</ref> Under his guidance, the German branch of the Commission published many volumes on the teaching of mathematics at all levels in Germany.\n\nThe [[London Mathematical Society]] awarded Klein its [[De Morgan Medal]] in 1893. He was elected a member of the [[Royal Society]] in 1885, and was awarded its [[Copley Medal]] in 1912. He retired the following year due to ill health, but continued to teach mathematics at his home for some years more.\n\nKlein bore the title of [[Geheimrat]].\n\nHe died in Göttingen in 1925.\n\n==Work==\nKlein's dissertation, on [[line geometry]] and its applications to [[mechanics]], classified second degree line complexes using [[Weierstrass]]'s theory of elementary divisors.\n\nKlein's first important mathematical discoveries were made in 1870. In collaboration with [[Sophus Lie]], he discovered the fundamental properties of the asymptotic lines on the [[Kummer surface]]. They went on to investigate [[W-curve]]s, curves invariant under a group of [[projective transformation]]s. It was Lie who introduced Klein to the concept of group, which was to play a major role in his later work. Klein also learned about groups from [[Camille Jordan]].<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Klein}}</ref>\n\nKlein devised the [[Klein bottle|bottle]] named after him, a one-sided closed surface which cannot be embedded in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], but it may be immersed as a cylinder looped back through itself to join with its other end from the \"inside\".  It may be embedded in Euclidean space of dimensions 4 and higher.\n\nIn the 1890s, Klein turned to [[mathematical physics]], a subject from which he had never strayed far, writing on the [[gyroscope]] with [[Arnold Sommerfeld]].<ref>[[:de:Werner Burau]] and [[:de:Bruno Schoeneberg]] \"Klein, Christian Felix.\" ''[[Dictionary of Scientific Biography|Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]''. 2008. Retrieved on 04 December 2014 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830902326.html</ref> In 1894 he launched the idea of an encyclopedia of mathematics including its applications, which became the [[Klein's encyclopedia|Enzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften]]. This enterprise, which ran until 1935, provided an important standard reference of enduring value.<ref>[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] (2009) ''Routes of Learning: Highways, Pathways, Byways in the History of Mathematics'', pp 44, 45, 90,  [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], ISBN 0-8018-9248-1</ref>\n\n===Erlangen Program===\n{{main|Erlangen program}}\nIn 1871, while at Göttingen, Klein made major discoveries in geometry. He published two papers ''On the So-called Non-Euclidean Geometry'' showing that Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries could be considered [[metric space]]s determined by a [[Cayley-Klein metric]]. This insight had the corollary that [[non-Euclidean geometry]] was consistent if and only if [[Euclidean geometry]] was, putting Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries on the same footing, and ending all controversy surrounding non-Euclidean geometry. [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] never accepted Klein's argument, believing it to be circular.\n\nKlein's synthesis of [[geometry]] as the study of the properties of a space that is invariant under a given [[transformation group|group of transformations]], known as the ''[[Erlangen program|Erlangen Program]]'' (1872), profoundly influenced the evolution of mathematics. This program was set out in Klein's inaugural lecture as professor at Erlangen, although it was not the actual speech he gave on the occasion. The ''Program'' proposed a unified approach to geometry that has become the accepted modern view. Klein showed how the essential properties of a given geometry could be represented by the group of [[transformation group|transformation]]s that preserve those properties. Thus the ''Program'''s definition of geometry encompassed both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nToday the significance of Klein's contributions to geometry is more than evident, but not because those contributions are now seen as strange or wrong. On the contrary, those contributions have become so much a part of our present mathematical thinking that it is hard for us to appreciate their novelty, and the way in which they were not immediately accepted by all his contemporaries.\n\n===Complex analysis===\nKlein saw his work on [[complex analysis]] as his major contribution to mathematics, specifically his work on:\n*The link between certain ideas of [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]'s and [[invariant theory]],\n*[[Number theory]] and [[abstract algebra]];\n*[[Group theory]];\n*[[Geometry]] with more than 3 dimensions and [[differential equations]], especially equations he invented, namely [[elliptic modular function]]s and [[automorphic function]]s.\n\nKlein showed that the [[modular group]] moves the fundamental region of the [[complex plane]] so as to [[tessellation|tessellate]] that plane. In 1879, he looked at the action of [[PSL(2,7)]], thought of as an image of the [[modular group]], and obtained an explicit representation of a [[Riemann surface]] today called the [[Klein quartic]]. He showed that that surface was a curve in [[projective space]], that its equation was ''x''<sup>3</sup>''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>3</sup>''z''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z''<sup>3</sup>''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and that its group of [[symmetry group|symmetries]] was [[PSL(2,7)]] of [[order (group theory)|order]] 168. His ''Ueber Riemann's Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihre Integrale'' (1882) treats complex analysis in a geometric way, connecting [[potential theory]] and [[conformal mapping]]s. This work drew on notions from [[fluid dynamics]].\n\nKlein considered equations of degree > 4, and was especially interested in using transcendental methods to solve the general equation of the fifth degree. Building on the methods of [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]] and [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]], he produced similar results to those of Brioschi and went on to completely solve the problem by means of the [[icosahedral group]]. This work led him to write a series of papers on [[elliptic modular function]]s.\n\nIn his 1884 book on the [[icosahedron]], Klein set out a theory of [[automorphic function]]s, connecting algebra and geometry. However [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] published an outline of his theory of automorphic functions in 1881, which led to a friendly rivalry between the two men. Both sought to state and prove a grand [[uniformization theorem]] that would serve as a capstone to the emerging theory. Klein succeeded in formulating such a theorem and in sketching a strategy for proving it. But while doing this work his health collapsed, as mentioned above.\n\nKlein summarized his work on [[automorphic function|automorphic]] and [[elliptic modular function]]s in a four volume treatise, written with [[Robert Fricke]] over a period of about 20 years.\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''Ueber Riemann's Theorie der Algebraischen Functionen und ihre Integrale'' (1882) {{JFM|14.0358.01}}, {{gutenberg|no=20313|name=e-text}}, [http://resolver.library.cornell.edu/math/1797666 also available from Cornell]\n* ''Vorlesungen über das Ikosaeder und die Auflösung der Gleichungen vom 5ten Grade'' (1884);  English translation by G.
