N. David''' (23 August 1909 – 23 July 1993) was an English statistician, born in [[Ivington]], Herefordshire, England. She was head of the Statistics Department at the University of California, Riverside in 1970.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDavid was named after [[Florence Nightingale]], who was a friend of her parents.\n\nDavid was tutored privately by a local parson, beginning at age five.\"<ref name=\"Salsburg2002\">{{cite book|author=David Salsburg|title=The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VCw_RxBrJc8C|date=1 May 2002|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-4668-0178-3|page=152}}</ref> By that age she already knew some arithmetic, so she began with algebra.  Since David already knew English, the parson taught her Latin and Greek.<ref name=\"Salsburg2002\" />  At the age of ten, she entered to formal schooling. She studied mainly mathematics for three years, with the aim of becoming an actuary, but at that time the actuarial firms only accepted men. She earned a degree in Mathematics in 1931.\n\nDavid received a scholarship and continued her studies with [[Karl Pearson]] at University College, London, as his research assistant. When Pearson retired, his son Egon, and R. A. Fisher, took over Karl's duties. After Karl Pearson died in 1934, David returned to the Biometrics laboratory to work with [[Jerzy Neyman]], submitting her four most recently published papers as her PhD thesis, and earned a doctorate in 1938.\n\n== Career ==\nWorking for Karl Pearson, F. N. David computed solutions to complicated multiple integrals, and the distribution of the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficients]]. As a result, her first book was released in 1938, called ''Tables of the Correlation Coefficient''. All the calculations were done on a hand-cranked mechanical calculator known as a Brunsviga.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], David worked for the [[Ministry of Home Security]]. In late 1939 when war had started but England had not yet been attacked, she created statistical models to predict the possible consequences of bombs exploding in high density populations such as the big cities of England and especially London. From these models, she determined estimates of harm to humans and damage to non-humans\nThis included the possible numbers living and dead, the reactions to fires and damaged buildings as well as damages to communications,utilities such as phones, water, gas, electricity and sewers.\nAs a result, when the Germans bombed London in 1940 and 1941, vital services were kept going and her models were updated and modified with the evidence from the real harms and real damage.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] she returned to University College in London and became a Professor in 1962. In 1968 she moved to California and became a Professor, and in 1970 the Chair, in the Department of Statistics at the [[University of California, Riverside]], and was the book review editor for the journal ''Biometrics'' for four years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biometrics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q6VOAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|page=1291}}</ref>\n\nBy 1977 she had retired but moved to the University of California, Berkeley where she continued to teach and do research in Biostatistics.\n\nDavid died in 1995.<ref name=\"Salsburg2002\" />\n\n== Awards and recognition==\nIn conjunction with other numerous academic honours, in 1992 David won the first Elizabeth L. Scott Award <ref name=\"JohnsonKotz2011\">{{cite book|author1=Norman L.

She studied the Correlation coefficient, and computed solutions of complicated multiple integrals, using the distribution of the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]].<ref name=\"Salsburg2002\" />\n\nDavid investigated the origins and history of probability and statistical ideas. She wrote a book on [[History of probability]], using problems thought of by famous mathematicians and scientists like Cardano and Galileo. It was called ''Games, Gods and Gambling: The Origins and History of Probability''.\n\n== Publications ==\nDavid published ten books and more than 1000 papers,<ref name=\"Salsburg2002\" /> including:\n\n* ''Combinatorial Chance'' ISBN 978-0-85264-057-9\n* ''Games, Gods and Gambling'' ISBN 978-0-85264-171-2.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[http://amstat.org/about/statisticiansinhistory/index.cfm?fuseaction=biosinfo&BioID=3 Florence N.
