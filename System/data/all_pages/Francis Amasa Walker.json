He received a commission to join the [[15th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|15th Massachusetts Infantry]] and quickly rose through the ranks as an assistant [[adjutant general]]. Walker fought in the [[Peninsula Campaign]] and was wounded at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] but subsequently participated in the [[Bristoe Campaign|Bristoe]], [[Overland Campaign|Overland]], and [[Siege of Petersburg|Richmond-Petersburg Campaigns]] before being captured by Confederate forces and held at the infamous [[Libby Prison]]. In July 1866, he was nominated by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] for the award of the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] [[United States Volunteers]], to rank from March 13, 1865, when he was age 24.<ref name=\"Eicher760\">{{Harvnb|Eicher|Eicher|2001|p=760}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the war, Walker served on the editorial staff of the ''[[Springfield Republican]]'' before using his family and military connections to gain appointment as the Chief of the [[Bureau of Statistics]] from 1869 to 1870 and Superintendent of the [[1870 United States Census|1870 census]] where he published an award-winning ''Statistical Atlas'' visualizing the data for the first time. He joined [[Yale University]]'s [[Sheffield Scientific School]] as a professor of [[political economy]] in 1872 and rose to international prominence serving as a chief member of the [[1876 Philadelphia Exposition]], American representative to the 1878 [[International Monetary Conferences|International Monetary Conference]], President of the [[American Statistical Association]] in 1882, and inaugural President of the [[American Economic Association]] in 1886, and vice president of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1890. Walker also led the [[1880 United States Census|1880 census]] which resulted in a twenty-two volume census, cementing Walker's reputation as the nation's preeminent statistician.\n\nAs an economist, Walker debunked the [[wage-fund doctrine]] and engaged in a prominent scholarly debate with [[Henry George]] on land, rent, and taxes. Walker argued in support of [[bimetallism]] and although he was an opponent of the nascent [[History of the socialist movement in the United States|socialist movement]], he argued that obligations existed between the employer and the employed.  He published his ''International Bimetallism'' at the height of the [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896 presidential election campaign]] in which economic issues were prominent. Walker was a prolific writer, authoring ten books on political economy and military history. In recognition of his contributions to economic theory, beginning in 1947, the American Economic Association recognized the lifetime achievement of an individual economist with a  \"Francis A. Walker Medal\".\n\nWalker accepted the presidency of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1881, a position he held for fifteen years until his death. During his tenure, he placed the institution on more stable financial footing by aggressively fund-raising and securing grants from the Massachusetts government, implemented many curricular reforms, oversaw the launch of new academic programs, and expanded the size of the Boston campus, faculty, and student enrollments. MIT's [[Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Walker Memorial|Walker Memorial Hall]], a former students' clubhouse and one of the original buildings on the [[Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology#The New Technology (1910–1940)|Charles River campus]], was dedicated to him in 1916.\n\n==Background==\nWalker was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the youngest son of Hanna (née Ambrose) and [[Amasa Walker]], a prominent economist and state politician. The Walkers had three children, Emma (born 1835), Robert (born 1837), and Francis.<ref name=\"MA15MVI\">{{Harvnb|Harnwell|2008}}</ref> Because the Walkers' next-door neighbor was [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], the junior Walker and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|junior Holmes]] were playmates as young children and renewed their friendship later in life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|p=23}}</ref> The family moved from Boston to [[North Brookfield, Massachusetts]] in 1843 and remained there.

While he had entered with the class of 1859, Walker became ill during his first year there and fell back a year. He was a member of the Delta Kappa and Athenian societies as a freshman, joined and withdrew from [[Alpha Sigma Phi]] as a sophomore on account of \"rowdyism\", and finally joined [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]].<ref name=\"Munroe 1923 p=29\">{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|p=29}}</ref><ref name=\"Appendix I\">{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|p=415}}</ref> As a student, Walker was awarded the Sweetser Essay Prize and the Hardy Prize for [[extemporaneous speaking]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|p=28}}</ref> He graduated in 1860 as [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with a degree in law.<ref name=\"Munroe 1923 p=29\"/> After graduation, he joined the law firm of [[Charles Devens]] and [[George Frisbie Hoar]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"Wright 248\"/>\n\n==Military service==\n\n===15th Massachusetts Infantry===\nAs tensions between the North and South increased over the winter of 1860–1861, Walker equipped himself and began drilling with Major Devens' 3rd Battalion of Rifles in Worcester and New York. Despite his older brother Robert serving in the 34th Massachusetts Infantry,<ref name=\"MA15MVI\"/> his father objected to his youngest son mobilizing with the first wave of volunteers. Walker returned to Worcester but began to lobby [[William Schouler]] and [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[John Albion Andrew|John Andrew]] to grant him a commission as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] under Devens' command of the 15th Massachusetts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=30–32}}</ref> Following his 21st birthday and the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in July 1861, Walker secured the consent of his father to join the war effort as well as assurances by Devens that he would receive an officer's commission. However, the lieutenancy never materialized and Devens instead offered Walker an appointment as a [[sergeant major]], which he assumed on August 1, 1861, after re-tailoring his previously ordered lieutenant's uniform to reflect his enlisted status.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=32–35}}</ref> However, by September 14, 1861, Walker had been recommended by Devens and reassigned to [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig.

He also taught Latin, Greek, and mathematics at the Williston Seminary in [[Easthampton, Massachusetts]] until being offered an editorial position at the ''[[Springfield Republican]]'' by [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|p=104}}</ref> At the ''Republican'', Walker wrote on [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era politics]], railroad regulation, and representation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=105–108}}</ref>\n\n===1870 Census===\nWhile his editorial career was moving forward, Walker called upon his own as well as his father's political contacts to secure an appointment under [[David Ames Wells]] as the Chief of the [[U.S. Bureau of Statistics]] and Deputy Special Commissioner of Internal Revenue in January 1869.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|p=109}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|1897|p=250}}</ref> On January 29, 1869, Major General [[Jacob Dolson Cox|J.D.

Among the problems facing Walker included a lack of authority to determine, enforce, or control the [[United States Marshals Service|marshals]]' personnel, methods, or timing all of which were regularly manipulated by local political interests. Additionally, the 1870 census would not only occur five years after Civil War but would also be the first in which [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipated]] [[African American]]s would be fully counted in the census.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=111–112}}</ref>\n\nOwing to the confluence of these problems, the Census was completed and tabulated several months behind schedule to much popular criticism, and led indirectly to a deterioration in Walker's health during the spring of 1871.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=113–118}}</ref><ref name=\"Fitz 309\"/> Walker took leave to travel to England with Bowles that summer to recuperate and upon return that fall, despite an offer from ''[[The New York Times]]'' to join their editorial board with an annual salary of $8,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8000|1871|2009|r=-2}}}} in 2009),<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|p=128}}</ref> accepted Secretary [[Columbus Delano]]'s offer to become the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs in November 1871.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=118–121}}</ref> The appointment was simultaneously a go-around to continue to fund Walker's federal responsibilities as Census superintendent despite Congress' cessation of appropriations for the position as well as a political opportunity to replace a scandal-ridden predecessor.<ref name=\"Fitz 309\">{{Harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1957|p=309}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|p=121}}</ref> Walker continued to work on the Census for several years thereafter, culminating in the publication of the ''Statistical Atlas of the United States'' that was unprecedented in its use of visual statistics and maps to report the results of the Census.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1957|p=310}}</ref> The ''Atlas'' won him praise from both the Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] as well as a First Class medal from the [[International Geographical Union|International Geographical Congress]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=125–126}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kinnahan|2008}}</ref>\n\n===Indian Bureau===\nDespite his Census-related efforts, Walker did not neglect his obligations as Indian Affairs Superintendent. In the post-war era, the government redoubled efforts to issue western land grants to settlers, ranchers, miners, and railroads which only served to heighten tensions with the Native American tribes who had already been displaced from their homelands as well as stripped of their ostensible sovereignty following an 1872 act of Congress.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=130–133}}</ref> The U.S. Army and various Indian tribes [[American Indian Wars#Wars of the West timeline|engaged in open hostilities]] throughout the 1860s and 1870s. Walker harbored no benevolence for the Indians, characterizing them as \"voluptuary,\" \"garrulous,\" \"lazy,\" \"cowardly in battle,\" and \"beggar-like\" even after an expedition along the [[Platte River]] to meet various chieftains. Walker echoed Grant's recommendation that the Native Americans be secured on [[Indian reservations|reservations]] of limited mineral or agricultural value so they could be educated and reformed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=131–135}}</ref> In November 1872, an eruption of settler-Indian violence in Oregon known as the [[Modoc War]] hastened Walker's disinterest in the position and he resigned as Commissioner on December 26, 1872 to take a faculty position at Yale.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|p=139}}</ref> However, Walker also criticized his successors' graft, corruption, and abuse of power in subsequent years and published ''The Indian Question'' in 1874.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=141–149}}</ref>\n\n===Other engagements===\n1876 was a busy year for Walker. [[Henry Brooks Adams]] sought to recruit Walker to be the Editor-in-Chief of his ''[[Boston Post]]'' after failing to recruit [[Horace White (writer)|Horace White]] and [[Charles Nordhoff (journalist)|Charles Nordhoff]] for the position.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=159–160}}</ref> That spring, Walker was nominated to run for the [[Secretary of the State of Connecticut]], running on a platform that would later be embodied by the \"[[Mugwump]]\" movement,<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|p=311}}</ref> but ultimately lost to Marvin H. Sanger by a margin of 7,200 votes out of 99,000 cast.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=159–164}}</ref> In the summer, the faculty of Amherst attempted to recruit him to become the President, but the position went instead to the Rev. [[Julius Hawley Seelye]] to appease the more conservative trustees.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=164–165}}</ref>\n\nWalker's rise to prominence was further accelerated by his appointment by [[Charles Francis Adams, Jr.]] as the Chief of the Bureau of Awards at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia. Previous world expositions in Europe were fraught with national factionalism and a superabundance of awards. Walker imposed a much leaner operation replacing juries with judges and being more selective in awarding prizes. Walker won formal international recognition when he was named a \"Knight Commander\" by Sweden and Norway and a \"Comendador\" by Spain. He was also invited to serve as Assistant Commissioner General for the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Exposition]]. The Centennial Exposition affected Walker's later career by greatly increasing his interest in technical education as well as introducing him to MIT President [[John D. Runkle]] and Treasurer [[John C. Cummings]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=166–181}}</ref>\n\n===1880 Census===\nWalker accepted a re-appointment as the superintendent of the [[1880 United States Census|1880 Census]] because a new law, spearheaded by [[Ohio's 19th congressional district|Congressman]] [[James A. Garfield]], had been passed to allow him to appoint trained census enumerators free from political influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|p=203}}</ref> Notably, the 1880 Census's results suggested population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over Walker's 1870 census but an investigation revealed that the latter had been inaccurately enumerated.

After intensive negotiations that called upon Walker's extensive connections and civic experience, in 1887 the legislature made a grant of $300,000 over two years to the Institute, which would lead to a total of $1.6 million in grants from the Commonwealth before the practice was discontinued in 1921.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=233–234, 239}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rogers-building.jpg|thumb|right|An 1889 [[photogravure]] of the 1865 \"Rogers\" Building in the foreground with the 1883 \"Walker\" Building in the background]]\nWalker sought to erect a new building to address the increasingly cramped conditions of the original [[Boylston Street]] campus located near [[Copley Square]], in the increasingly fashionable and crowded [[Back Bay (Boston)|Back Bay]] neighborhood of Boston.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=220–222}}</ref> Because the stipulations of the original land grant prevented MIT from covering more than two-ninths of its current lot, Walker announced his intention to build the industrial expansion on a lot directly across from the [[Trinity Church, Boston|Trinity Church]] fully intending that expected opposition would lead to favorable terms for selling the proposed land and funding construction elsewhere.<ref>{{Harvnb|Munroe|1923|pp=221–222}}</ref> With the financial health of the Institute only beginning to recover, Walker began construction on the partially-funded expansion, fully expecting the immediacy of the project to be a persuasive tool for raising its funds.
