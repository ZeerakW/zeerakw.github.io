Dent & Co.</ref> He was Charles Darwin's half-cousin.\n\n==Early life==\nGalton was born at \"The Larches\", a large house in the [[Sparkbrook]] area of [[Birmingham]], England, built on the site of \"Fair Hill\", the former home of [[Joseph Priestley]], which the [[botanist]] [[William Withering]] had renamed. He was [[Charles Darwin]]'s half-cousin, sharing the common grandparent [[Erasmus Darwin]]. His father was [[Samuel Tertius Galton]], son of [[Samuel \"John\" Galton]]. The Galtons were famous and highly successful [[Quaker]] gun-manufacturers and bankers, while the Darwins were distinguished in medicine and science.\n\nHe was cousin of [[Douglas Strutt Galton]] and half-cousin of [[Charles Darwin]] and both families boasted Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] and members who loved to invent in their spare time. Both Erasmus Darwin and Samuel Galton were founding members of the famous [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham, whose members included [[Matthew Boulton|Boulton]], [[James Watt|Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth|Edgeworth]], and other distinguished scientists and industrialists. Likewise, both families were known for their literary talent: Erasmus Darwin composed lengthy technical treatises in verse; Galton's aunt [[Mary Anne Galton]] wrote on aesthetics and religion, and her notable autobiography detailed the unique environment of her childhood populated by Lunar Society members.\n\n[[File:Francis Galton00.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Galton by [[Octavius Oakley]], 1840]]\n\nGalton was by many accounts a [[child prodigy]]&nbsp;– he was reading by the age of two; at age five he knew some [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]] and long division, and by the age of six he had moved on to adult books, including [[Shakespeare]] for pleasure, and poetry, which he quoted at length {{Harv|Bulmer|2003|p=4}}. Later in life, Galton would propose a connection between genius and insanity based on his own experience. He stated, \"''Men who leave their mark on the world are very often those who, being gifted and full of nervous power, are at the same time haunted and driven by a dominant idea, and are therefore within a measurable distance of insanity''\"<ref name=Pearson>Pearson, K.

He followed this up with mathematical studies at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge]], from 1840 to early 1844.<ref>{{acad|id=GLTN839F|name=Galton, Francis}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the records of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]], it was in February 1844 that Galton became a freemason at the so-called ''Scientific'' lodge, held at the Red Lion Inn in Cambridge, progressing through the three masonic degrees as follows: Apprentice, 5 February 1844; Fellow Craft, 11 March 1844; Master Mason, 13 May 1844. A curious note in the record states: \"Francis Galton Trinity College student, gained his certificate 13 March 1845\".<ref>'Scientific Lodge No. 105 Cambridge' in ''Membership Records: Foreign and Country Lodges, Nos. 17–145, 1837–1862''.

The Galton Laboratory, University College London (typescript), at Section 88 on p. 10</ref>\n\nA severe [[nervous breakdown]] altered Galton's original intention to try for honours. He elected instead to take a \"poll\" (pass) B.A. degree, like his half-cousin Charles Darwin {{Harv|Bulmer|2003|p=5}}. (Following the Cambridge custom, he was awarded an M.A. without further study, in 1847.) He then briefly resumed his medical studies. The death of his father in 1844 had left him financially independent but emotionally destitute,<ref>citation?</ref> and he terminated his medical studies entirely, turning to foreign travel, sport and technical invention.\n\nIn his early years Galton was an enthusiastic traveller, and made a notable solo trip through Eastern Europe to [[Constantinople]], before going up to Cambridge. In 1845 and 1846 he went to [[Egypt]] and travelled down the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]] in the [[Sudan]], and from there to [[Beirut]], [[Damascus]] and down the [[Jordan]].\n\nIn 1850 he joined the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and over the next two years mounted a long and difficult [[exploration|expedition]] into then little-known [[South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]). He wrote a successful book on his experience, \"Narrative of an Explorer in Tropical South Africa\".{{sfn|Galton|1853}} He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] in 1853 and the Silver Medal of the French Geographical Society for his pioneering cartographic survey of the region {{Harv|Bulmer|2003|p=16}}. This established his reputation as a geographer and explorer. He proceeded to write the best-selling ''The Art of Travel'', a handbook of practical advice for the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] on the move, which went through many editions and is still in print.\n\nIn January 1853 Galton met Louisa Jane Butler (1822–1897) at his neighbour's home and they were married on 1 August 1853. The union of 43 years proved childless.<ref>[http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/search/pearson/vol2/pages/vol2_0320.htm Life of Francis Galton by Karl Pearson Vol 2 : image 0320]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I7570&ged=auden-bicknell.ged |title=Sir Francis Galton FRS FRGS&nbsp;– I7570 – Individual Information&nbsp;– PhpGedView |publisher=Stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Louisa Jane Galton00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|<center>Louisa Jane Butler]]\n\n==Middle years==\nGalton was a [[polymath]] who made important contributions in many fields of science, including [[meteorology]] (the anti-cyclone and the first popular weather maps), statistics (regression and correlation), [[psychology]] ([[synaesthesia]]), [[biology]] (the nature and mechanism of heredity), and [[criminology]] (fingerprints). Much of this was influenced by his [[penchant]] for counting or measuring. Galton prepared the first [[weather map]] published in [[The Times]] (1 April 1875, showing the weather from the previous day, 31 March), now a standard feature in newspapers worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/meteorologist.html |title=Francis Galton: Meteorologist |publisher=Galton.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe became very active in the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], presenting many papers on a wide variety of topics at its meetings from 1858 to 1899 {{Harv|Bulmer|2003|p=29}}. He was the general secretary from 1863 to 1867, president of the Geographical section in 1867 and 1872, and president of the Anthropological Section in 1877 and 1885. He was active on the council of the Royal Geographical Society for over forty years, in various committees of the Royal Society, and on the Meteorological Council.\n\n[[James McKeen Cattell]], a student of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] who had been reading Galton's articles, decided he wanted to study under him. He eventually built a professional relationship with Galton, measuring subjects and working together on research.<ref name=\"Gilham\"/>\n\nIn 1888, Galton established a lab in the science galleries of the South Kensington Museum. In Galton's lab, participants could be measured to gain knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. Galton also used these data for his own research. He would typically charge people a small fee for his services.<ref name=\"Hergenhann\">Hergenhahn, B.R., (2008). ''An Introduction to the History of Psychology''. Colorado: Wadsworth Pub.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Galton wrote a controversial letter to the Times titled 'Africa for the Chinese', where he argued that the Chinese, as a race capable of high civilisation and (in his opinion) only temporarily stunted by the recent failures of Chinese dynasties, should be encouraged to immigrate to Africa and displace the supposedly inferior aboriginal blacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://galton.org/letters/africa-for-chinese/AfricaForTheChinese.htm |title=Africa for the Chinese by Francis Galton |publisher=Galton.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Heredity and eugenics==\n[[File:Francis Galton2.jpg|thumb|Galton in his later years]]\nThe publication by his cousin Charles Darwin of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 was an event that changed Galton's life {{Harv|Forrest|1974|page=84}}. He came to be gripped by the work, especially the first chapter on \"Variation under Domestication,\" concerning [[animal breeding]].\n\nGalton devoted much of the rest of his life to exploring variation in human populations and its implications, at which Darwin had only hinted. In so doing, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.\n\nGalton was interested at first in the question of whether human ability was [[hereditary]], and proposed to count the number of the relatives of various degrees of eminent men. If the qualities were hereditary, he reasoned, there should be more eminent men among the relatives than among the general population. To test this, he invented the methods of [[historiometry]]. Galton obtained extensive data from a broad range of biographical sources which he tabulated and compared in various ways. This pioneering work was described in detail in his book ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869.<ref name=\"HereditaryGenius\"/> Here he showed, among other things, that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when going from the first degree to the second degree relatives, and from the second degree to the third. He took this as evidence of the [[inheritance of intelligence|inheritance of abilities]].\n\nGalton recognised the limitations of his methods in these two works, and believed the question could be better studied by comparisons of twins. His method envisaged testing to see if twins who were similar at birth diverged in dissimilar environments, and whether twins dissimilar at birth converged when reared in similar environments. He again used the method of questionnaires to gather various sorts of data, which were tabulated and described in a paper ''The history of twins'' in 1875. In so doing he anticipated the modern field of [[behaviour genetics]], which relies heavily on [[twin studies]]. He concluded that the evidence favoured nature rather than nurture. He also proposed [[adoption study|adoption studies]], including trans-racial adoption studies, to separate the effects of heredity and environment.\n\nGalton recognised that cultural circumstances influenced the capability of a civilisation's citizens, and their [[reproductive success]]. In ''Hereditary Genius'', he envisaged a situation conducive to resilient and enduring civilisation as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe best form of civilization in respect to the improvement of the race, would be one in which society was not costly; where incomes were chiefly derived from professional sources, and not much through inheritance; where every lad had a chance of showing his abilities, and, if highly gifted, was enabled to achieve a first-class education and entrance into professional life, by the liberal help of the exhibitions and scholarships which he had gained in his early youth; where marriage was held in as high honour as in ancient Jewish times; where the pride of race was encouraged (of course I do not refer to the nonsensical sentiment of the present day, that goes under that name); where the weak could find a welcome and a refuge in celibate monasteries or sisterhoods, and lastly, where the better sort of emigrants and refugees from other lands were invited and welcomed, and their descendants naturalised. ([http://galton.org/books/hereditary-genius/text/html/galton-1869-genius394.html p. 362])<ref name=\"HereditaryGenius\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nGalton invented the term ''[[eugenics]]'' in 1883 and set down many of his observations and conclusions in a book, ''[[Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development]]''.<ref>[http://galton.org/books/human-faculty/ Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development by Francis Galton<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He believed that a scheme of 'marks' for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged by provision of monetary incentives. He pointed out some of the tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were ''[[dysgenics|dysgenic]]''. He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute<ref name=\"Gilham\"/>\n\nThe ''Eugenics Review'', the journal of the Eugenics Education Society, commenced publication in 1909. Galton, the Honorary President of the society, wrote the foreword for the first volume.<ref name=\"Gilham\" /> The First International Congress of Eugenics was held in July 1912. [[Winston Churchill]] and Carls Elliot were among the attendees.<ref name=\"Gilham\" />\n\n==Empirical test of pangenesis and Lamarckism==\nGalton conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to challenge Charles Darwin's hypothetical theory of [[pangenesis]]. Darwin had proposed as part of this hypothesis that certain particles, which he called \"[[gemmules]]\" moved throughout the body and were also responsible for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Galton, in consultation with Darwin, set out to see if they were transported in the blood. In a long series of experiments in 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s216074.htm Science Show&nbsp;– 25/11/00: Sir Francis Galton<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood {{Harv|Bulmer|2003|pp=116–118}}.\n\nDarwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' where he wrote:<blockquote>\nNow, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my ''[[Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood.\" He goes on to admit: \"Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.<ref>http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1751&viewtype=side&pageseq=1</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nGalton explicitly rejected the idea of the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] ([[Lamarckism]]), and was an early proponent of \"hard heredity\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Bulmer |first=Michael |year=2003 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |title=Francis Galton – Pioneer of Heredity and Biometry |isbn=0-8018-7403-3 |pages=105–107}}</ref> through selection alone. He came close to rediscovering Mendel's particulate theory of inheritance, but was prevented from making the final breakthrough in this regard because of his focus on continuous, rather than discrete, traits (now known as [[polygenic]] traits). He went on to found the [[Biostatistics|biometric]] approach to the study of heredity, distinguished by its use of statistical techniques to study continuous traits and population-scale aspects of heredity.\n\nThis approach was later taken up enthusiastically by [[Karl Pearson]] and [[W.F.R. Weldon]]; together, they founded the highly influential journal ''[[Biometrika]]'' in 1901.  ([[R.A. Fisher]] would later show how the biometrical approach could be reconciled with the Mendelian approach.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=R|last2=Pettersson|first2= M |author3-last= Carlborg|author3-first= C|title=A century after Fisher: time for a new paradigm in quantitative genetics|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=23 October 2013|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2013.09.006}}</ref> ) The statistical techniques that Galton invented (correlation, regression—see below) and phenomena he established (regression to the mean) formed the basis of the biometric approach and are now essential tools in all the social sciences.\n\n==Innovations in statistics and psychological theory==\n\n===Historiometry===\nThe method used in ''Hereditary Genius'' has been described as the first example of [[historiometry]]. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 [[Fellows of the Royal Society]]. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as [[birth order]] and the occupation and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, ''English men of science: their nature and nurture'', in 1874. In the end, it promoted the [[nature versus nurture]] question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.\n\n===The Lexical Hypothesis===\nSir Francis was the first scientist to recognise what is now known as the [[Lexical hypothesis]].<ref name=\"personality determinants\">{{cite book | title=Personality: Determinants, Dynamics, and Potentials | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Caprara, G. V., & Cervone, D. | year=2000 | location=New York | page=68 | isbn=0-521-58310-1}}</ref> This is the idea that the most salient and socially relevant personality differences in people's lives will eventually become encoded into language. The hypothesis further suggests that by sampling language, it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human [[personality traits]].\n\n===The questionnaire===\nGalton's inquiries into the mind involved detailed recording of people's subjective accounts of whether and how their minds dealt with phenomena such as [[visual memory|mental imagery]]. To better elicit this information, he pioneered the use of the [[questionnaire]]. In one study, he asked his fellow members of the Royal Society of London to describe mental images that they experienced. In another, he collected in-depth surveys from eminent scientists for a work examining the effects of nature and nurture on the propensity toward scientific thinking.<ref name=\"Clauser\">Clauser, Brian E.

In 1906, visiting a livestock fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers were invited to guess the animal's weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, but not one person hit the exact mark: 1,198 pounds. Galton stated that \"the middlemost estimate expresses the ''vox populi'', every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the voters\",<ref>Galton, F., \"[http://galton.org/essays/1900-1911/galton-1907-vox-populi.pdf Vox Populi]\", ''Nature'', 7 March 1907, accessed 25 July 2012</ref> and calculated this value (in modern terminology, the [[median]]) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, he acknowledged<ref>\"[http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/galton/search/essays/pages/galton-1907-ballot-box_1.htm The Ballot Box]\", ''Nature'', 28 March 1907, accessed 25 July 2012</ref> that the mean of the guesses, at 1,197 pounds, was even more accurate.<ref>[http://adamsmithlives.blogs.com/thoughts/2007/10/experts-and-inf.html adamsmithlives.blogs.com posting]</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Schell | first = Barbara A Boyt | title = Clinical And Professional Reasoning in Occupational Therapy | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year = 2007 | page = 372 | isbn = 0-7817-5914-5 }}</ref>\n\nThe same year, Galton suggested in a letter to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' a better method of cutting a round cake by avoiding making radial incisions.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://galton.org/essays/1900-1911/galton-1906-cake.pdf|title=Cutting a Round Cake on Scientific Principles (Letters to the Editor)|author=Francis Galton|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|page=173|date=20 December 1906|issue=1938|volume=75|doi=10.1038/075173c0 }}</ref>\n\n===Experimental derivation of the normal distribution===\nStudying variation, Galton invented the [[bean machine|quincunx]], a [[pachinko]]-like device, also known as the [[bean machine]], as a tool for demonstrating the [[law of error]] and the [[normal distribution]] {{Harv|Bulmer|2003|p=4}}.\n\n===Bivariate normal distribution===\nHe also discovered the properties of the [[bivariate normal distribution]] and its relationship to [[regression analysis]].\n\n===Correlation and regression===\n[[File:Galton's correlation diagram 1875.jpg|thumb|Galton's correlation diagram 1886<ref>Francis Galton (1886) [http://books.google.com/books?id=JPcRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA246#v=onepage&q&f=false Anthropological Miscellanea: \"Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature,\"] ''The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', '''15''': 246–263 ; see [http://books.google.com/books?id=JPcRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA248-IA3#v=onepage&q&f=false Plate X.]</ref>]]\nIn 1846, the French physicist [[Auguste Bravais]] (1811–1863) first developed what would become the correlation coefficient.<ref>Bravais A.

This is now a core of modern statistics and regression.\n\nGalton invented the use of the regression line {{Harv|Bulmer|2003|p=184}} and for the choice of r (for reversion or regression) to represent the correlation coefficient.<ref name=\"Clauser\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s and 1880s he was a pioneer in the use of [[normal distribution|normal theory]] to fit histograms to actual tabulated data, much of which he collected himself: for instance [[big data|large samples]] of sibling and parental height. Consideration of the results from these empirical studies lead to his further insights into evolution, natural selection, and regression to the mean.\n\n===Regression to mediocrity===\nGalton was the first to describe and explain the common phenomenon of [[regression toward the mean]], which he first observed in his experiments on the size of the seeds of successive generations of sweet peas.\n\nThe conditions under which regression toward the mean occurs depend on the way the term is mathematically defined. Galton first observed the phenomenon in the context of [[simple linear regression]] of data points. Galton<ref>{{Cite book|title = Natural Inheritance|last = Galton|first = F|publisher = Macmillan|year = 1889|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}</ref> developed the following model: pellets fall through a ''[[quincunx]]'' or \"[[bean machine]]\" forming a normal distribution centered directly under their entrance point. These pellets could then be released down into a second gallery (corresponding to a second measurement occasion. Galton then asked the reverse question \"from where did these pellets come?\"\n<blockquote>The answer was not \"on average directly above\". Rather it was \"on average, more towards the middle\", for the simple reason that there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwards (p. 477) <ref>{{Cite journal|title = Darwin, Galton and the Statistical Enlightenment|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-985X.2010.00643.x/abstract|journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics in Society)|date = 2010-07-01|issn = 1467-985X|pages=469–482|volume = 173|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-985X.2010.00643.x|first = Stephen M.|last = Stigler}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Theories of perception===\nGalton went beyond measurement and summary to attempt to explain the phenomena he observed. Among such developments, he proposed an early theory of ranges of sound and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], and collected large quantities of anthropometric data from the public through his popular and long-running Anthropometric Laboratory, which he established in 1884, and where he studied over 9,000 people.<ref name=\"Gilham\">Gillham, Nicholas Wright (2001). A Life of Sir Francis Galton: From African Exploration to the Birth of Eugenics, Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-514365-5.</ref> It was not until 1985 that these data were analysed in their entirety.\n\n===Differential psychology===\nGalton's study of human abilities ultimately led to the foundation of [[differential psychology]] and the formulation of the first mental tests. He was interested in measuring humans in every way possible. This included measuring their ability to make sensory discrimination which he assumed was linked to intellectual prowess. Galton suggested that individual differences in general ability are reﬂected in performance on relatively simple sensory capacities and in speed of reaction to a stimulus, variables that could be objectively measured by tests of sensory discrimination and reaction\ntime.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Arthur R.|title=Galton's Legacy to Research on Intelligence|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|date=April 2002|series=34 (2)|pages=145–172|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/2802204478791895184.pdf}}</ref> He also measured how quickly people reacted which he later linked to internal wiring which ultimately limited intelligence ability. Throughout his research Galton assumed that people who reacted faster were more intelligent than others.\n\n===Composite photography===\nGalton also devised a technique called \"[[composite portrait]]ure\" (produced by superimposing multiple photographic portraits of individuals' faces registered on their eyes) to create an average face (see [[averageness]]). In the 1990s, a hundred years after his discovery, much psychological research has examined the [[attractiveness]] of these faces, an aspect that Galton had remarked on in his original lecture. Others, including [[Sigmund Freud]] in his work on dreams, picked up Galton's suggestion that these composites might represent a useful metaphor for an [[Ideal type]] or a [[concept]] of a \"[[natural kind]]\" (see [[Eleanor Rosch]])—such as Jewish men, criminals, patients with tuberculosis, etc.—onto the same photographic plate, thereby yielding a blended whole, or \"composite\", that he hoped could generalise the facial appearance of his subject into an \"average\" or \"central type\".<ref name=Galton1883/><ref>Galton, F.

Jacobs asked Galton to create a composite photograph of a Jewish type.<ref>Daniel Akiva Novak.

However, his technique did not prove useful and fell into disuse, although after much work on it including by photographers [[Lewis Hine]] and [[John L. Lovell]] and [[Arthur Batut]].\n\n==Fingerprints==\nIn a [[Royal Institution]] paper in 1888 and three books (''[[Finger Prints (book)|Finger Prints]]'', 1892; ''Decipherment of Blurred Finger Prints'', 1893; and ''Fingerprint Directories'', 1895),<ref>Conklin, Barbara Gardner., Robert Gardner, and Dennis Shortelle. Encyclopedia of Forensic Science: a Compendium of Detective Fact and Fiction. Westport, Conn.: Oryx, 2002. Print.</ref> Galton estimated the probability of two persons having the same [[fingerprint]] and studied the heritability and racial differences in fingerprints. He wrote about the technique (inadvertently sparking a controversy between Herschel and Faulds that was to last until 1917), identifying common pattern in fingerprints and devising a classification system that survives to this day.\n\nThe method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints had been introduced in the 1860s by Sir [[William James Herschel]] in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by Dr [[Henry Faulds]] in 1880, but Galton was the first to place the study on a scientific footing, which assisted its acceptance by the courts {{Harv|Bulmer|2003|p=35}}. Galton pointed out that there were specific types of fingerprint patterns. He described and classified them into eight broad categories: 1: plain arch, 2: tented arch, 3: simple loop, 4: central pocket loop, 5: double loop, 6: lateral pocket loop, 7: plain whorl, and 8: accidental.<ref name=\"innes\">{{Cite book\n| last = Innes\n| first = Brian\n| title = Body in Question: Exploring the Cutting Edge in Forensic Science\n| publisher = Amber Books\n| location = New York\n| year = 2005\n| pages = 32–33\n| isbn = 1-904687-42-3}}</ref>\n\n==Final years==\n[[File:Sir Francis Galton by Charles Wellington Furse.jpg|thumb|''Sir Francis Galton'' by [[Charles Wellington Furse]], given to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], London in 1954]]\nIn an effort to reach a wider audience, Galton worked on a novel entitled ''Kantsaywhere'' from May until December 1910. The novel described a utopia organised by a eugenic religion, designed to breed [[Fitness (biology)|fitter]] and smarter humans. His unpublished notebooks show that this was an expansion of material he had been composing since at least 1901. He offered it to [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] for publication, but they showed little enthusiasm. Galton wrote to his niece that it should be either \"smothered or superseded\". His niece appears to have burnt most of the novel, offended by the love scenes, but large fragments survived.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060617174551/http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/search/pearson/vol3a/pages/vol3a_0470.htm Life of Francis Galton by Karl Pearson Vol 3a : image 470<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Honours and impact==\nOver the course of his career Galton received many major awards, including the [[Copley Medal]] of the Royal Society (1910). He received in 1853 the Founder's Medal, the highest award of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], for his explorations and map-making of southwest Africa. He was elected a member of the prestigious [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in 1855 and made a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1860.
