From 1891 onward he was appointed the founding editor of ''[[The Economic Journal]]''.\n\n==Life==\nEdgeworth was born in [[Edgeworthstown]], [[County Longford]], Ireland. He did not attend school, but was educated by private [[tutors]] at the Edgeworthstown estate until he reached the age to enter university. His father, [[Francis Beaufort Edgeworth]] was descended from French Huguenots, and \"was a restless philosophy student at [[Cambridge]] on his way to Germany when he decided to elope with a teenage [[Catalonia]]n refugee [Rosa Florentina Eroles] he met on the steps of the [[British Museum]].  One of the outcomes of their marriage was Ysidro Francis Edgeworth (the name order was reversed later) ...\"<ref>{{citation|first=Lluis|last=Barbe|title=Francis Ysidro Edgeworth: A Portrait With Family and Friends|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2010|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m93iASHrXnEC&pg=PA1|quotation=His name was actually Ysidro Francis Edgeworth, but his family and friends called him Francis or Frank, and when he started publishing in 1876 he transposed his Christian names.}}</ref> [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]] was his grandfather, and the writer [[Maria Edgeworth]] his aunt.\n\nAs a student at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], Edgeworth studied ancient and modern languages. A voracious [[autodidact]], he studied mathematics and economics only after he had completed university.  He qualified as a [[barrister]] in London in 1877 but did not practise.<ref>{{harvtxt|Barbe|2010}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=m93iASHrXnEC&pg=PA85 p.&nbsp;85]: \"The year 1877 was a productive year for Edgeworth in earning titles. He acquired the degree of Master of Arts from Oxford and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple. This means that he had successfully completed his studies at the professional level. However, by then he had decided not to pursue a legal career.\"</ref>\n\nOn the basis of his publications in economics and [[mathematical statistics]] in the 1880s, Edgeworth was appointed to a chair in economics at [[King's College London]] in 1888, and in 1891 was appointed [[Drummond Professor of Political Economy]] at [[Oxford University]]. Also in 1891 he was appointed the founding editor of ''[[The Economic Journal]]''. He continued as editor or joint-editor until his death 35 years later.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Edgeworth}}</ref>\n\nEdgeworth was a highly influential figure in the development of [[neo-classical economics]]. He was the first to apply certain formal mathematical techniques to individual decision making in economics. He developed [[utility theory]], introducing the [[indifference curve]] and the famous [[Edgeworth box]], which is now familiar to undergraduate students of [[microeconomics]]. He is also known for the [[Edgeworth conjecture]], which states that the [[Core (economics)|core]] of an economy shrinks to the set of [[general equilibrium|competitive equilibria]] as the number of [[Agent (economics)|agents]] in the economy gets large. In statistics, Edgeworth is most prominently remembered by having his name on the [[Edgeworth series]].\n\nHis most original and creative book on economics was ''Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences'', published in 1881 at the beginning of his long career in the subject. The book was notoriously difficult to read. He frequently referenced literary sources and interspersed the writing with passages in a number of languages, including [[Latin]], French and [[Ancient Greek]]. The mathematics was similarly difficult, and a number of his creative applications of mathematics to economic or moral issues would be judged as incomprehensible. However, one of the most influential economists of the time, [[Alfred Marshall]], commented in his review of ''Mathematical Psychics'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/het/texts/marshall/marshedgew81.htm |title=Alfred Marshall (1881) \"Review of Edgeworth's Mathematical Psychics\" |publisher=Cepa.newschool.edu |date= |accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n:''This book shows clear signs of genius, and is a promise of great things to come... His readers may sometimes wish that he had kept his work by him a little longer till he had worked it out a little more fully, and obtained that simplicity which comes only through long labour. But taking it as what it claims to be, 'a tentative study', we can only admire its brilliancy, force, and originality.''\n\nEdgeworth's close friend [[William Stanley Jevons]] said of ''Mathematical Psychics'':<ref>[http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/het/texts/jevons/jevonsedgew81.htm W.S. Jevons's \"Review of Mathematical Psychics\", 1881<!-- bot-generated title -->] at cepa.newschool.edu</ref>\n\n:''Whatever else readers of this book may think about it, they would probably all agree that it is a very remarkable one... There can be no doubt that in the style of his composition Mr. Edgeworth does not do justice to his matter. His style, if not obscure, is implicit, so that the reader is left to puzzle out every important sentence like an enigma.''\n\nThe [[Royal Statistical Society]] awarded him the [[Guy Medal]] in 1907. Edgeworth served as the president of the Royal Statistical Society, 1912–14. In 1928 [[Arthur Lyon Bowley|A.L. Bowley]] published a book entitled and devoted to ''F. Y. Edgeworth's Contributions to Mathematical Statistics''.\n\n==Contributions to economics==\n[[File:Edgeworth - Papers relating to political economy, 1925 - 5771271.tif|thumb|''Papers relating to political economy'', 1925]]\n\nIn ''Mathematical Psychics'' (1881), his most famous and original book, he criticised Jevons's theory of [[barter]] [[Trade|exchange]], showing that under a system of \"recontracting\" there will be, in fact, many solutions, an \"indeterminacy of contract\". Edgeworth's \"range of final settlements\" was later resurrected by [[Martin Shubik]] (1959) as the game-theoretic concept of \"the core\".<ref name=\"bare_url\">http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/edgew.htm</ref>\n\n*'''Edgeworth's conjecture'''\nAs the number of agents in an economy increases, the degree of indeterminacy is reduced.\nIn the limit case of an infinite number of agents (perfect competition), contract becomes fully determinate and identical to the 'equilibrium' of economists. The only way of resolving this indeterminacy of contract would be to appeal to the [[utilitarian]] principle of maximising the sum of the [[utility|utilities]] of traders over the range of final settlements. Incidentally, it was in this 1881 book that Edgeworth introduced into economics the generalised utility function, U (x, y, z, ...), and drew the first 'indifference curve'.<ref name=\"bare_url\" />\n\n*'''International trade'''\nHe was the first one to use offer curves and community indifference curves to illustrate its main propositions, including the \"optimal [[tariff]]\".\n\n*'''Taxation paradox'''\nTaxation of a good may actually result in a decrease in price.\n\nHe set the utilitarian foundations for highly progressive taxation, arguing that the optimal distribution of taxes should be such that 'the marginal disutility incurred by each taxpayer should be the same' (Edgeworth, 1897).\n\n*'''Monopoly pricing'''\nIn 1897, in an article on monopoly pricing, Edgeworth criticised Cournot's exact solution to the [[duopoly]] problem with quantity adjustments as well as Bertrand's \"instantly competitive\" result in a duopoly model with price adjustment. At the same time, Edgeworth showed how price competition between two firms with capacity constraints and/or rising [[marginal cost]] curves resulted in indeterminacy. This gave rise to the [[Bertrand-Edgeworth model]] of oligopoly.\n\n*'''Marginal productivity theory'''\nEdgeworth criticised the marginal productivity theory in several articles (1904, 1911), and tried to refine the neo-classical theory of distribution on a more solid basis. Although his work in questions of [[war finance]] during World War I was original, they were a bit too theoretical and did not achieve the practical influence he had hoped.\n\n*'''Edgeworth's limit theorem'''\nEdgeworth's limit theorem relates to equilibrium of supply and demand in a free market. See [[Edgeworth's limit theorem]].\n\nThough Edgeworth's economic ideas were original and in depth, his contemporaries frequently complained of his manner of expression for lack of clarity.  He was prone to [[verbosity]] and coining obscure words without providing definition for the reader.<ref>{{citation|title=Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, Statistician|first=Stephen M.|last=Stigler|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society|series=Series A|pages=287–322|volume=141|issue=3|year=1978|jstor= 2344804}}.
