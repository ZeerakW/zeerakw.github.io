He has written op-eds for publications such as ''[[The Financial Times]]'', ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[The Washington Post]]''.\n\nHe was an adjunct professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1989 until 1996 and also taught at [[George Washington University]] and [[American University]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Use of language==\nLuntz frequently tests word and phrase choices using focus groups and interviews.  His stated purpose in this is the goal of causing audiences to react based on emotion. \"80 percent of our life is emotion, and only 20 percent is intellect. I am much more interested in how you feel than how you think.\" \"If I respond to you quietly, the viewer at home is going to have a different reaction than if I respond to you with emotion and with passion and I wave my arms around. Somebody like this is an intellectual; somebody like this is a freak.\"<ref name=\"InterviewFrank\" />\n\nIn an article in ''The New Yorker'' Luntz is quoted as saying,<blockquote>The way my words are created is by taking the words of others.... I've moderated an average of a hundred plus focus groups a year over five years... I show them language that I've created. Then I leave a line for them to create language for me.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Lemann | first = Nicholas | author-link = | last2=  | first2 = | author2-link = | title = The Word Lab: The mad Science Behind What the Candidates Say | newspaper = The New Yorker | pages = | date=  October 16, 2000 | url = | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a January 9, 2007, interview on ''[[Fresh Air]]'' with [[Terry Gross]], Luntz redefined the term \"[[Orwellian]]\" in a \"positive\" sense, saying that if one reads [[George Orwell|Orwell's]] \"Essay On Language\" (presumably referring to \"[[Politics and the English Language]]\"),\n\"To be 'Orwellian' is to speak with absolute clarity, to be succinct, to explain what the event is, to talk about what triggers something happening… and to do so without any pejorative whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"FreshAir\">[[Fresh Air]] with [[Terry Gross]], [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6761960 ''Frank Luntz Explains 'Words That Work'''], January 9, 2007. Retrieved June 28, 2007.</ref>\n\nLuntz's description of \"Orwellian\" is considered to contradict both its popularly-defined meaning as well as that defined by George Orwell.  Luntz believes that Orwell would not have approved of many of the uses to which his [[pseudonym]] is applied by quoting Orwell's essay \"Politics and the English Language\", where Luntz focuses on how Orwell derides the use of cliché and dying metaphors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nLuntz's description of his job revolves around exploiting the emotional content of language. \"It's all emotion. But there's nothing wrong with emotion. When we are in love, we are not rational; we are emotional.\" \"...my job is to look for the words that trigger the emotion.\" \"We know that words and emotion together are the most powerful force known to mankind..\"<ref name=\"InterviewFrank\" />\n\nAdditionally in his January 9, 2007, interview on ''Fresh Air'', Luntz discussed his use of the term, \"energy exploration\" (oil drilling). His research on the matter involved showing people a picture of current oil drilling and asking if in the picture it \"looks like exploration or drilling.\" He said that 90 percent of the people he spoke to said it looked like exploring. \"Therefore I'd argue that it is a more appropriate way to communicate.\" He went on to say \"if the public says after looking at the pictures, that doesn't look like my definition of drilling—it looks like my definition of exploring—then don't you think we should be calling it what people see it to be, rather than adding a political aspect to it all?\" Terry Gross responded: \"Should we be calling it what it actually is, as opposed to what somebody thinks it might be? The difference between exploration and actually getting out the oil—they're two different things, aren't they?\"<ref name=\"FreshAir\" />\n\nJames L. Martin, chairman of the conservative [[60 Plus Association]], described Luntz's role as being that of pollster and popularizer of the phrase \"death tax\".<blockquote>Martin gained an important ally in GOP pollster Frank Luntz, whose polling revealed that 'death tax' sparked voter resentment in a way that 'inheritance tax' and 'estate tax' couldn't match. After all, who wouldn't be opposed to a 'tax on death'? Luntz shared his findings with Republicans and included the phrase in the GOP's Contract with America. Luntz went so far as to recommend in a memo to GOP lawmakers that they stage press conferences 'at your local mortuary' to dramatize the issue. 'I believe this backdrop will clearly resonate with your constituents,' he wrote. 'Death is something the [[American people]] understand.' Apparently, he's right. Spurred by Luntz, Republicans have employed the term 'death tax' so aggressively that it has entered the popular lexicon. Nonpartisan venues like newspapers and magazines have begun to use it in a neutral context—a coup for abolitionists like Martin.<ref name = \"Meet Mr. Death\">[[Joshua Green (journalist)|Joshua Green]] [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=meet_mr_death \"Meet Mr. Death\"], The American Prospect, May 20, 2001</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Publications==\nLuntz is the author of the 2007 New York Times Best Seller, \"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Luntz|first=Frank|title=Words that work : it's not what you say, it's what people hear|date=2007|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York|isbn=9781401309299|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Words_That_Work.html?id=OBGPPAAACAAJ|edition=1st|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> His second book, \"What Americans Really Want ...

The report, commissioned by [[The Israel Project]], advised media spokespeople to use specific language that Luntz believed would create a more favorable impression of Israel in the United States and the rest of the international community. For example, when discussing the contours of a [[two-state solution]], the report advised describing Palestinian negotiating points as \"demands\" because Americans dislike people who make \"demands.\"  The report was marked \"not for distribution or publication\", but it was leaked to ''[[Newsweek]]'' shortly after it was written.  According to the Guardian, Luntz also wrote that \"Israeli spokesmen or political leaders must never, ever justify 'the deliberate slaughter of innocent women and children' and they must aggressively challenge those who accuse Israel of such a crime.\" Luntz cited as an example of an \"effective Israeli sound bite\" one which read, \"I particularly want to reach out to Palestinian mothers who have lost their children. No parent should have to bury their child.\" [[Patrick Cockburn]] criticized the report as essentially admitting \"the Israeli government does not really want a two-state solution, but this should be masked because 78 per cent of Americans do.″<ref>{{cite news|first=Patrick|last=Cockburn|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/israelgaza-conflict-the-secret-report-that-helps-israelis-to-hide-facts-9630765.html|title=Israel-Gaza conflict: The secret report that helps Israelis to hide facts|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=July 27, 2014|accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Global warming===\n{{further|Public opinion on climate change|Media coverage of climate change}}\nAlthough Luntz later tried to distance himself from the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] policy, it was his idea that administration communications reframe \"[[global warming]]\" as \"[[climate change]]\" since \"climate change\" was thought to sound less severe.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burkeman|first=Oliver|title=Memo exposes Bush's new green strategy|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2003/mar/04/usnews.climatechange|publisher=The Guardian|location=London|date=March 4, 2003|accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref>  Luntz has since said that he is not responsible for what the Bush administration did after that time.

Voters believe that there is no [[Scientific consensus on global warming|consensus]] about [[global warming]] within the [[scientific community]]. Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly.

This is true of McCain voters and Obama voters alike. And even those that don't still believe it is essential for America to pursue policies that promote energy independence and a cleaner, healthier environment.\" In reference to recent political events, Luntz added: \"People are much more interested in seeing solutions than watching yet another partisan political argument.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edf.org/pressrelease.cfm?ContentID=10735|title=Pollster Frank Luntz Releases New Polling Results: Bipartisan Public Support for National Climate Legislation|author=Environmental Defense Fund|work=Environmental Defense Fund|accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 2005 UK Conservative leadership election ===\nIn 2005 Luntz conducted a focus group broadcast on the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leadership race on the [[BBC]] current affairs show ''[[Newsnight]]''.

Luntz noted that, like the Irish scenario, the Coalition was well established, presiding over the country for 11 years and overseeing continued economic growth for much of that period; and that unlike the lead-up to the Irish elections, [[Australia]] had a stronger and more popular opposition leader in [[Kevin Rudd]]: \"This is much closer to the Irish election where the leader just barely scraped in, Bertie Ahern, because the economy was so good.

Resulting in some conservatives who suffer from what might be called a political version of Stockholm Syndrome—where the captives identify with their captors.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Problematic Frank Luntz’s Stockholm Syndrome|url=http://spectator.org/blog/2013/04/25/the-problematic-frank-luntzs-w|publisher=American Spectator|date=25 April 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe article was a response to an April 22, 2013 leaked recording of Luntz at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he said conservative radio personalities (specifically [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Mark Levin]]) were being \"problematic\" and \"destroying\" Republicans' ability to connect with more voters, or even maintain a majority in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the 2014 mid-term elections.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frank Luntz's problematic secret Rush Limbaugh tape|url=http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/frank-luntz-rush-limbaugh-problematic-secret-tape|publisher=Mother Jones|date=30 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs part of his critique Luntz said:\n<blockquote>And they get great ratings, and they drive the message, and it's really problematic. And this is not on the Democratic side. It's only on the Republican side... [Democrats have] got every other source of news on their side. And so that is a lot of what's driving it. If you take—Marco Rubio's getting his ass kicked. Who's my Rubio fan here? We talked about it. He's getting destroyed! By Mark Levin, by Rush Limbaugh, and a few others. He's trying to find a legitimate, long-term effective solution to immigration that isn't the traditional Republican approach, and talk radio is killing him. That's what's causing this thing underneath.
