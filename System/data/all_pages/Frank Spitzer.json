Rare among mathematicians, he chose to focus broadly on \"[[phenomenon|phenomena]]\", rather than any one of the many specific [[theorem]]s that might help to articulate a given phenomenon. His book ''Principles of Random Walk'', first published in 1964, remains a well-cited classic.\n\nSpitzer was born into a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], and by the time he was twelve years old, the [[Nazism|Nazi]] threat in Austria was evident. His parents were able to send him to a [[summer camp]] for Jewish children in [[Sweden]], and, as a result, Spitzer spent all of the war years in Sweden. He lived with two Swedish families, learned [[Swedish language|Swedish]], graduated from high school, and for one year attended [[Royal Institute of Technology|Tekniska Hogskolan]] in [[Stockholm]].\n\nDuring the war years, Spitzer's parents and his sister were able to make their way to the [[United States]] by passing through the unoccupied parts of [[France]] and [[North Africa]], and, after the war, Spitzer joined his family in their new country.  Spitzer enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]] just as the war in [[Europe]] was ending. After completing his [[Armed forces|military service]] in 1947, Spitzer entered the [[University of Michigan]] ([[Ann Arbor]]) to study mathematics. His studies went quickly, and he completed his B.A. and Ph.D. in just six years.\n\nSpitzer's first academic appointments were at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (1953–1958), but most of his academic career was spent at [[Cornell University]], with leaves at the Institute for Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] and the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Sweden. Among many his many honors, Spitzer was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].\n\n==Publications==\n*{{citation|last=Spitzer|title=  Principles of Random Walk|mr=0171290\n|first= Frank\n|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume= 34|publisher= Springer-Verlag|place= New York-Heidelberg, |year=1976|page=40}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=5129}}\n*[http://newton.nap.edu/html/biomems/fspitzer.html Biographical memoir] – by [[Harry Kesten]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Spitzer, Frank\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Austrian mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = July 24, 1926\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = February 1, 1992\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spitzer, Frank}}\n[[Category:1926 births]]\n[[Category:1992 deaths]]\n[[Category:Austrian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:American Jews]]\n[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:University of Michigan alumni]]\n[[Category:Royal Institute of Technology alumni]]\n[[Category:Probability theorists]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Frank Spitzer"}}}}
