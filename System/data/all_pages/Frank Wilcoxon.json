(1966) ''Obituary: Frank Wilcoxon.'' Biometrics 22(1): 192–194</ref> He grew up in [[Catskill (town), New York|Catskill, New York]], but received part of his education in [[England]]. In 1917, he graduated from [[Pennsylvania Military College]] with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] After the [[First World War]] he entered graduate studies, first at [[Rutgers University]], where he was awarded an [[Master's degree|M.S.]] in [[chemistry]] in 1921, and then at [[Cornell University]], gaining a [[Ph.D.]] in [[physical chemistry]] in 1924.\n\nWilcoxon entered a research career, working at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research from 1925 to 1941. He then moved to the Atlas Powder Company, where he designed and directed the Control Laboratory, before joining the [[American Cyanamid|American Cyanamid Company]] in 1943. During this time he developed an interest in inferential statistics through the study of [[Ronald Fisher|R. A. Fisher]]'s 1925 text, ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]''. He retired in 1957.\n\nOver his career Wilcoxon published over 70 papers.<ref name=\"biometrics1967\">Karas, J. & Savage, I.R. (1967) ''Publications of Frank Wilcoxon (1892–1965).'' Biometrics 23(1): 1–10</ref> His most well-known paper<ref name=\"biometrics1945\">Wilcoxon, F. (1945) ''Individual Comparisons by Ranking Methods.'' Biometrics Bulletin 1: 80–83.</ref> contained the two new statistical tests that still bear his name, the [[Mann–Whitney U|Wilcoxon rank-sum test]] and the [[Wilcoxon signed-rank test]]. These are [[non-parametric]] alternatives to the unpaired and paired [[Student's t-test]]s respectively. He died on 18 November 1965 after a brief illness.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Brookes, E.
