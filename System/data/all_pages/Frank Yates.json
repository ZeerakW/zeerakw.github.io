In 1920 he obtained a scholarship at [[St John's College, Cambridge]] and four years later graduated with a First Class Honours degree.<ref name=\"frs\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n\nHe spent two years teaching [[mathematics]] to secondary school pupils at [[Malvern College]] before heading to [[Africa]] where he was mathematical advisor on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] Survey. He returned to [[England]] due to ill health and met and married a chemist, Margaret Forsythe Marsden, the daughter of a [[civil servant]].  This marriage was dissolved in 1933 and he later married  Prascovie (Pauline) Tchitchkine, previously the partner of Alexis Tchitchkine. After her death in 1976 he married Ruth Hunt, his long-time secretary.<ref name=\"frs\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n\nIn 1931 Yates was appointed assistant statistician at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] by [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]]. In 1933 he became head of statistics when Fisher  went to [[University College London]]. At Rothamsted he worked on the [[design of experiments]], including contributions to the theory of [[analysis of variance]] and originating Yates's algorithm and the balanced incomplete [[block design]].<ref name=\"frs\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/><ref name=\"ims\"/>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] he worked on what would later be called [[operations research]].<ref name=\"frs\"/><ref name=\"ims\"/>\n\nAfter the war he worked on [[sample survey]] design and analysis. He became an enthusiast of electronic [[computer]]s, in 1954 obtaining an [[Elliott Brothers (computer company)|Elliott 401]] for Rothamsted and contributing to the initial development of [[statistical computing]].<ref name=\"frs\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/><ref name=\"ims\"/> In 1960 he was awarded the [[Guy Medal]] in Gold of the [[Royal Statistical Society]], and in 1966 he was awarded the [[Royal Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]].<ref name=\"frs\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/> He retired from Rothamsted to become a Senior Research Fellow at [[Imperial College London]].<ref name=\"frs\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/> He died in 1994, aged 92, in [[Harpenden]].<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\n==Selected publications==\n*''The design and analysis of factorial experiments'', Technical Communication no. 35 of the Commonwealth Bureau of Soils (1937) (alternatively attributed to the Imperial Bureau of Soil Science).\n*''Statistical tables for biological, agricultural and medical research'' (1938, coauthor [[Ronald Fisher|R.A.
