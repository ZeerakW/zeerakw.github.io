He entered the [[Indian Medical Service]] and was posted Assistant-Surgeon in [[Bengal]] in 1840. In 1853 he became Surgeon, in 1860 Surgeon-Major and ultimately Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals. He was also Professor of Medicine in the [[Bengal Medical College]]. He spent 30 years in India, where he was a leading figure in the field of education, in which he was a major campaigner to establish the first universities in India and [[prison reform]], including holding the post of Inspector-General of Gaols in lower Bengal. In 1857, during the [[Indian Mutiny]], he was asked to investigate the [[Andaman Islands]] as a potential [[penal colony]]. He subsequently published a book about his Andaman experiences: ''Adventures and researches among the Andaman islanders'' (1863).<ref>{{cite journal|title = Obituary|journal = British Medical Journal|accessdate = 6 August 2010|pmc=2433148|page=628|volume=1|issue=1888}}</ref>\n\nHe retired to the UK in 1870 and started a new career as an Inspector for the Local Government Board.
