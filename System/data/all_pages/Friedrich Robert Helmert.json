After schooling in Freiberg and [[Dresden]], he entered the Polytechnische Schule, now Technische Universität, in Dresden to study engineering science in 1859. Finding him especially  enthusiastic about geodesy, one of his teachers, August Nagel, hired him while still a student to work on the triangulation of the [[Erzgebirge]] and the drafting of the trigonometric network for Saxony. In 1863 Helmert became Nagel's assistant on the Central European Arc Measurement. After a year's study of mathematics and astronomy Helmert obtained his doctor's degree from the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1867 for a thesis based on his work for Nagel.\n\nIn 1870 Helmert became instructor and in 1872 professor at [[RWTH Aachen]], the new Technical University in [[Aachen]]. At Aachen he wrote ''Die mathematischen und physikalischen Theorieen der höheren Geodäsie'' (Part I was published in 1880 and Part II in 1884). This work laid the foundations of modern [[geodesy]]. See [[history of geodesy]].  Part I is devoted to the mathematical aspects of geodesy and contains a comprehensive\nsummary of techniques for solving for [[geodesics on an ellipsoid]].\n\nThe method of [[least squares]] had been introduced into geodesy by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] and Helmert wrote a fine book on least squares (1872, with a second edition in 1907) in this tradition, which became a standard text.{{sfn|Hald|1998|p=633|ps=: \"[It] is a pedagogical masterpiece; it became a standard text until it was superseded by expositions using matrix algebra.\"}} In 1876 he discovered the [[chi-squared distribution]] as the distribution of the sample variance for a [[normal distribution]].{{sfn|Hald|1998|pp=633–692|loc=27.

In 1916 he had a stroke and died of its effects the following year in [[Potsdam]].\n\n==Honours==\nHelmert received many honours. He was president of the global [[geodesy|geodetic]] association of \"[[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|Internationale Erdmessung]]\", member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Berlin]], was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1905, and recipient of some 25 German and foreign decorations.\n\nThe lunar crater [[Helmert (crater)|Helmert]] was named in his honor, approved by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] in 1973.<ref>[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/2437 Helmert], Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Helmert transformation]] (in geodesy)\n*[[Gravity of Earth#Mathematical models|Helmert's equation]]\n*[[coordinate system]]\n*[[Helmert–Wolf blocking]]\n*[[national survey]]\n*terrestrial [[gravity field]]\n*[[Geodesics on an ellipsoid]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* Walther Fischer \"Helmert, Friedrich Robert\" ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography''  volume 7, pp.&nbsp;239–241, New York: Scribners 1973.\n* {{cite book |title=A history of mathematical statistics from 1750 to 1930 |last=Hald |first=Anders |authorlink=Anders Hald |year=1998 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |isbn=0-471-17912-4 |ref=harv }}\n*O.
