He has made fundamental contributions to the theory, methodology and application of Markov Chain Monte Carlo and related methods in Statistics. He has developed crucial convergence and stability theory, constructed a theory of optimal scaling for [[Metropolis–Hastings algorithm]]s, and has introduced and explored the theory of adaptive MCMC algorithms. He has made pioneering contributions to infinite dimensional simulation problems and inference in stochastic processes. His work has already found practical application in the study of epidemics such as [[Avian Influenza]] and [[Foot-and-mouth disease|Foot and Mouth disease]].\"<ref name=\"frs\">[http://royalsociety.org/people/gareth-roberts Professor Gareth Roberts FRS]</ref>}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Guy Medal}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Roberts, Gareth Owen\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = British statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1964\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Liverpool, England\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Roberts, Gareth Owen}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:English statisticians]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Warwick]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Winners of the Guy Medal in Silver]]\n[[Category:Winners of the Guy Medal in Bronze]]\n[[Category:Fellows of St Catharine's College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Academics of the University of Nottingham]]\n[[Category:Date of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:1964 births]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Gareth Roberts (statistician)"}}}}
