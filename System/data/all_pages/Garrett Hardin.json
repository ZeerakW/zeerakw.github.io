His exposition of the [[tragedy of the commons]], in a famous 1968 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'',<ref name=tragedy/> called attention to \"the damage that innocent actions by individuals can inflict on the environment\".<ref name=NYTobit/> He is also known for Hardin's First Law of Human Ecology: \"You cannot do only one thing\",<ref name=Miller1993/>{{Page needed|date=September 2012}} which \"modestly implies that there is at least one unwanted consequence\".<ref name=HardinFilters/>\n\n==Biography==\nHardin received a B.S. in [[zoology]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1936 and a PhD in [[microbiology]] from [[Stanford University]] in 1941.  Moving to the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1946, he served there as Professor of [[Human Ecology]] from 1963 until his (nominal) retirement in 1978. He was among the first members of the [[Society for General Systems Research]].\n\n== Major works and positions ==\nA major focus of his career, and one to which he returned repeatedly, was the issue of [[human overpopulation]].  This led to writings on controversial subjects such as advocating [[abortion]] rights,<ref>{{cite book |last=Hardin |first=Garrett |title=Stalking the Wild Taboo |publisher=William Kaufmann, Inc. |date=1973 |pages=3–9 |chapter=Chapter 1: I Become an Abortionist |isbn=0-913232-03-3}}</ref> which earned him criticism from the [[Right-wing politics|political right]], and advocating [[eugenics]] by [[forced sterilization]],{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and strict limits to non-western immigration, which earned him criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political left]].  In his essays, he also tackled subjects such as [[Conservation ethic|conservation]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Hardin |first=Garrett |title=Naked Emperors |publisher=William Kaufmann, Inc. |date=1982 |pages=190–195 |chapter=Chapter 22: Conservation's Secret Question |isbn=0-86576-032-2}}</ref> and [[creationism]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hardin |first=Garrett |title=Naked Emperors |publisher=William Kaufmann, Inc. |date=1982 |pages=49–57 |chapter=Chapter 7: \"Scientific Creationism\" — Marketing Deception as Truth |isbn=0-86576-032-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Neomalthusian approach and \"Tragedy of the commons\"===\nIn 1968 Hardin applied his conceptual model developed in his essay \"The tragedy of the commons\" to human population growth, the use of the Earth's [[natural resource]]s, and the welfare state.<ref name=tragedy/> His essay cited an 1833 pamphlet by the English economist [[William Forster Lloyd]] which included an example of herders sharing a common parcel of land, which would lead to overgrazing.\n\nHardin blamed the [[welfare state]] for allowing the tragedy of the commons; where the state provides for children and supports over-breeding as a fundamental human right, [[Malthusian catastrophe]] is inevitable. Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that \"Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.\"<ref name=tragedy/>{{rp|1244}} However, [[environmental history|environmental historians]] [[Joachim Radkau]], [[Alfred Thomas Grove]] and [[Oliver Rackham]] denounced Hardin \"as an American with no notion at all how Commons actually work\".<ref name=Radkau/>\n\nIn addition, Hardin's pessimistic outlook was in contradiction with [[Elinor Ostrom]]'s later work on success of co-operative structures like the management of [[common land]],<ref name=Araral/> for which she shared the 2009 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] together with [[Oliver E. Williamson]]. In contrast to Hardin, they stated neither commons or \"Allmende\" in the generic nor classical meaning are bound to fail; to the contrary \"the wealth of the commons\" has gained renewed interest in the scientific community.<ref name=BollierHelfrich/> Hardin's work was also criticized<ref name=Dasgupta/> as historically inaccurate in failing to account for the [[demographic transition]], and for failing to distinguish between [[Common-pool resource|common property]] and [[Open access (infrastructure)|open access]] resources.<ref name=Ciriacy/>\n\nIt should be noted that Lloyd's original example, re-discovered by Hardin, could only apply to unregulated use of land regarded as a common resource. Normally, rights of use of Common land in England and Wales were, and still are, closely regulated, and available only to \"commoners\". If excessive use was made of common land, for example in overgrazing, a common would be \"stinted\", that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure; thus rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further. Controls on usage can help mitigate the tragedy of the commons.<ref name=Cox/>\n\n=== Lifeboat metaphor and denial of food aid ===\nIn September 1974, he published the article \"Living on a Lifeboat\" in ''[[BioScience]]'' magazine, arguing that contributing food to help the [[Famines in Ethiopia|Ethiopian famine]] would add to overpopulation, which he considered the root of [[Ethiopia]]'s problems.\n\n=== Living Within Limits ===\nIn 1993, Hardin published ''Living Within Limits'', which he described at the time as a summation of all his previous works.  In this book, he argues that natural sciences are grounded in the concept of limits (such as the [[speed of light]]), while social sciences such as economics are grounded in concepts that have no limits (such as \"infinite-Earth\" economic models). He notes that most of the more notable scientific (as opposed to political) arguments concerning environmental economics are between natural scientists, such as [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], and economists, such as [[Julian Simon]].  Hardin goes on to label those who reflexively argue for growth as \"growthmaniacs\",<ref name=stalkers/> and argues against the institutional faith in [[exponential growth]] on a finite planet, illustrating this with the example of [[compound interest]], or \"[[usury]]\".  This, he claims, must eventually fail, and he argues that society has been duped into confusing interest with debt.<ref name=HardinLiving/>  Hardin writes, \"At this late date millions of people believe in the fertility of money with an ardor seldom accorded to traditional religious doctrines.\"<ref name=HardinLiving/>{{rp|67}}\n\n=== Position in the Bell curve controversy and against affirmative action ===\nIn 1994, he was one of 52 signatories on \"[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]\",<ref name=\"gottfredson\"/> an editorial written by [[Linda Gottfredson]] and published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on issues related to [[race and intelligence]] following the publication of the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. Like many of the other signatories of that editorial, Hardin was also a grantee of the [[Pioneer Fund]], which funds controversial research on the topic of race and intelligence and is frequently described as promoting [[scientific racism]]. On February 11, 1998 he debated Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<ref name=DebateVideo/><ref name=Williams/>\n\nHardin's last book ''The Ostrich Factor: Our Population Myopia'' (1999), a warning about the threat of overpopulation to the Earth's sustainable economic future, called for coercive constraints on \"unqualified reproductive rights\" and argued that [[affirmative action]] is a form of [[racism]].\n\n== Participation in the Death with dignity movement and suicide ==\nHardin, who suffered from a heart disorder, and his wife Jane, who suffered from [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's disease]], were members of [[Compassion & Choices|End-of-Life Choices]], formerly known as the [[Hemlock Society]], and believed in individuals choosing their own time to die.  They committed [[suicide]] in their [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] home in September 2003, shortly after their 62nd wedding anniversary.  He was 88 and she was 81.<ref name=SBNews/>\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Books===\n* 1965, ''Nature and Man's Fate'' New American Library.
