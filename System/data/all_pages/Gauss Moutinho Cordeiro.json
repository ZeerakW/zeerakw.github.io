He has published more than 260 research articles in international scientific journals with referee practice (2014) and supervised more than 50 MSc dissertations and DSc theses. He was also president of the [[Associação Brasileira de Estatística]], 2000-2002. He was one of the founder editors of the [[Brazilian Journal of Probability and Statistics]] and the Editor in Chief of this journal between 1995-2000. Cordeiro's main research interests in statistics include asymptotic theory, probability distributions and regression models. He created, developed and organized several statistical meetings in Brazil. He has acted as referee for several important statistical journals such as the Annals of Statistics, Biometrical Journal, Biometrika, Brazilian Journal of Probability and Statistics,  Canadian Journal of Statistics, Communications in Statistics-Theory and Methods,  Communications in Statistics-Simulation and Computation, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, International Statistical Review, Journal of the American Statistical Association, Journal of Applied Probability, Journal of Applied Statistics, Journal of Data Science, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society A, B, C, Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, Journal of Statistical Theory and Applications, Sankhya, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics, South African Statistical Journal, Statistica Neerlandica, Statistical Methodology, Statistical Papers, Statistics, Statistics and Probability Letters.  In 2010, Cordeiro awarded from the Brazilian Government the National Medal for Scientific Merit at the order of Comendador. He is a member of the Academy of Sciences of Pernambuco (Brazil). \n\n==Publications==\n===Books===\n* An Introduction to Bartlett Correction and Bias Reduction.
