[[Taguchi methods]] have been controversial among some conventional Western statisticians,<ref>{{cite book |last=Wadsworth |first=Harrison M. |title=Handbook of statistical methods for engineers and scientists |edition=2nd |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Gerald F. |title=Quality problem solving |year=1998 |publisher=American Society for Quality |pages=250?251}}</ref> but others have accepted many of the concepts introduced by him as valid extensions to the body of knowledge.\n\n==Biography==\n\nTaguchi was born and raised in the textile town of [[Tokamachi, Niigata|Tokamachi]], in [[Niigata prefecture]]. He initially studied textile [[engineering]] at [[Gunma University|Kiryu Technical College]] with the intention of entering the family [[kimono]] business.<ref name=\"asqbio\">{{cite web |title=Genichi Taguchi |url=http://www.asq.org/about-asq/who-we-are/bio_taguchi.html |publisher=American Society for Quality}}</ref> However, with the escalation of [[World War II]] in 1942, he was drafted into the Astronomical Department of the Navigation Institute of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].\n\nAfter the war, in 1948 he joined the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Public Health and Welfare]], where he came under the influence of eminent [[statistician]] [[Matosaburo Masuyama]], who kindled his interest in the [[design of experiments]]. He also worked at the [[Institute of Statistical Mathematics]] during this time,<ref name=\"asqbio\" /> and supported experimental work on the production of [[penicillin]] at [[Morinaga Pharmaceuticals]], a [[Morinaga Seika]] company.\n\nIn 1950, he joined the Electrical Communications Laboratory (ECL) of the [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]] Corporation just as statistical quality control was beginning to become popular in [[Japan]],<ref name=\"asqbio\" /> under the influence of [[W. Edwards Deming]] and the [[Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers]]. ECL was engaged in a rivalry with [[Bell Labs]] to develop cross bar and telephone switching systems, and Taguchi spent his twelve years there in developing methods for enhancing quality and reliability. Even at this point, he was beginning to consult widely in Japanese industry, with [[Toyota]] being an early adopter of his ideas.\n\nDuring the 1950s, he collaborated widely and in 1954-1955 was visiting professor at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]], where he worked with [[C. R. Rao]],  [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Walter A. Shewhart]].<ref name=\"jayaswal\">{{cite book |last=Jayaswal |first=Bijay K. |author2=Peter C. Patton |title=Design for Trustworthy Software: Tools, Techniques, and Methodology of Developing Robust Software |year=2006 |publisher=Prentice Hall |page=44}}</ref> While working at the SQC Unit of ISI, he was introduced to the [[orthogonal array testing|orthogonal arrays]] invented by C. R. Rao - a topic which was to be instrumental in enabling him to develop the foundation blocks of what is now known as Taguchi methods.\n\nOn completing his doctorate at [[Kyushu University]] in 1962,<ref name=\"ieee95\">{{cite journal |last=Taguchi |first=Genichi |title=Quality engineering (Taguchi methods) for the development of electronic circuit technology |journal=IEEE Transactions on Reliability |publisher=IEEE Reliability Society |volume=44 |issue=2 |date=June 1995 |pages=225?229 |issn=0018-9529 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&arnumber=387375&isnumber=8781 |doi=10.1109/24.387375}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Studies on mathematical statistics for quality control|author=Gen'ichi TAGUCHI|publisher=Kushu University|date=March 1962|series=Doctoral thesis|url=http://iss.ndl.go.jp/books/R100000002-I000007814567-00}}</ref> he left ECL, though he maintained a consulting relationship. In the same year he visited [[Princeton University]] under the sponsorship of [[John Tukey]], who arranged a spell at [[Bell Labs]], his old ECL rivals. In 1964 he became professor of [[engineering]] at [[Aoyama Gakuin University]], [[Tokyo]].<ref name=\"jayaswal\" /> In 1966 he began a collaboration with [[Yuin Wu]], who later emigrated to the [[United States|U.S.]] and, in 1980, invited Taguchi to lecture. During his visit there, Taguchi himself financed a return to [[Bell Labs]], where his initial teaching had made little enduring impact. This second visit began a collaboration with [[Madhav Phadke]] and a growing enthusiasm for his methodology in [[Bell Labs]] and elsewhere, including [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Boeing]], [[Xerox]] and [[ITT Corporation|ITT]].\n\nSince 1982, Genichi Taguchi has been an advisor to the [[Japanese Standards Institute]] and executive director of the American Supplier Institute, an international consulting organisation.<ref>{{cite web |title=About ASI |url=http://www.amsup.com/about.htm |publisher=American Supplier Institute |accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref>  His concepts pertaining to experimental design, the loss function, robust design, and the reduction of variation have influenced fields beyond product design and manufacturing, such as [[sales process engineering]].<ref name=\"Selden 1997\">{{cite book |title=Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop |last=Selden |first=Paul H. |publisher=ASQ Quality Press |location = Milwaukee, WI| year=1997 |pages=156?158, 169, 237}}</ref>\n\n==Contributions==\n\n{{main|Taguchi methods}}\n\nTaguchi has made a very influential contribution to industrial statistics. Key elements of his quality philosophy include the following:\n#[[Taguchi loss function]], used to measure financial loss to society resulting from poor quality;\n#The philosophy of ''off-line quality control'', designing products and processes so that they are insensitive (\"robust\") to parameters outside the design engineer's control; and\n#Innovations in the statistical [[design of experiments]], notably the use of an outer array for factors that are uncontrollable in real life, but are systematically varied in the experiment.\n\n==Honours==\n\n*1986 - [[Willard F. Rockwell Medal]] of the [[International Technology Institute]]\n*1989 - [[Medals of Honour (Japan)#Blue ribbon|Indigo Ribbon]] from the [[Emperor of Japan]]\n*1990 - Honoured as a Quality Guru by the British Department of Trade and Industry\n*1995 - Honorary member of the [[Japanese Society of Quality Control]]\n*1997 - [[Automotive Hall of Fame]] Inductee\n*1998 - Honorary member of the [[American Society for Quality]]<ref name=\"asqbio\" />\n*1998 - Honorary member of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]]\n*1999 - Honorary president of the [[Robust Quality Engineering Society]] (Japan)\n\n==Book==\n\n*{{Cite book|title=Taguchi on Robust Technology Development: Bringing Quality Engineering Upstream|author=Genichi Taguchi|publisher=ASME Press|date=August 1992|isbn=978-0791800287}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Robust Engineering: Learn How to Boost Quality while Reducing Costs & Time to Market|author=Genichi Taguchi, Subir Chowdhury, Shin Taguchi|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|date=October 1999|isbn=978-0071347822}}\n*{{Cite book|title=The Mahalanobis-Taguchi System|author=Genichi Taguchi, Subir Chowdhury, Yuin Wu|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|date=August 2000|isbn=978-0071362634}}\n*{{Cite book|title=The Mahalanobis-Taguchi Strategy : A Pattern Technology System|author=Genichi Taguchi, Rajesh Jugulum|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2002|isbn=978-0471023333}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Computer-Based Robust Engineering: Essential For DFSS|author=Genichi Taguchi, Rajesh Jugulum, Shin  Taguchi|publisher=Amer Society for Quality|year=2004|isbn=978-0873896221}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Taguchi's Quality Engineering Handbook|author=Genichi Taguchi, Subir Chowdhury, Yuin Wu|publisher=John Wiley|year=2005|isbn=978-0471413349}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/people/taguchi.gif Photograph of Dr. Genichi Taguchi]\n\n<!--\n==Bibliography==\n===Publications by Taguchi===\n===Discussions and developments of Taguchi's work===\n-->\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Taguchi, Genichi\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = \n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Japanese statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = January 1, 1924\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Tokamachi, Niigata|Tokamachi]], [[Japan]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =  June 2, 2012\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =  Japan\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taguchi, Genichi}}\n[[Category:Aoyama Gakuin University faculty]]\n[[Category:Japanese business theorists]]\n[[Category:Japanese industrial engineers]]\n[[Category:Gunma University alumni]]\n[[Category:Quality]]\n[[Category:Quality experts]]\n[[Category:Japanese statisticians]]\n[[Category:1924 births]]\n[[Category:2012 deaths]]\n[[Category:Winners of the Shewhart Medal]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Genichi Taguchi"}}}}
