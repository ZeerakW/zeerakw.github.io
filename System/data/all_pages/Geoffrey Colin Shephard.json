He asked [[Shephard's problem]] on the volumes of projected convex bodies, posed [[Shephard's conjecture|another problem]] on polyhedral nets, proved the [[Shephard–Todd theorem]] in invariant theory of finite groups, began the study of [[complex polytope]]s, and classified the [[complex reflection group]]s.\n\nShephard earned his Ph.D. in 1954 from [[Cambridge University]], under the supervision of [[J. A. Todd]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy|name=Geoffrey Colin Shephard|id=124232}}</ref> He was a professor of mathematics at the [[University of East Anglia]] until his retirement.<ref>[http://www.uea.ac.uk/mth/mthpeople/retired Retired Faculty], University of East Anglia School of Mathematics, accessed 2011-10-09.</ref>\n\n==Selected publications==\n*{{Citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zY6nPwAACAAJ |title=Tilings and Patterns |publisher=W.
