He is particularly recognised for his achievements in the rigorous theory of disordered physical systems. Especially influential is his work on and around [[percolation theory]], the contact model for stochastic spatial epidemics, and the random-cluster model, a class that includes the [[Ising model|Ising]]/[[Potts model]]s of [[ferromagnetism]]. His monograph on percolation is a standard work in a core area of probability, and is widely cited. His breadth within probability is emphasized by his important contributions to probabilistic [[combinatorics]] and probabilistic [[number theory]].<ref name=\"royal\"/>}}\n\n==Personal==\nGeoffrey Grimmett is the son of Benjamin J Grimmett and Patrica W (Lewis) Grimmett.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=sBvu2l%2BeQ8rYa7%2F25ae8%2FA&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=May 10, 2014|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-aca}}\n{{succession box |\n  before=[[Barry Everitt (scientist)|Barry Everitt]]|\n  title=[[Downing College, Cambridge|Master of Downing College, Cambridge]] |\n  years=2013&ndash; |\n  after=Incumbent\n}}\n{{end}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2012}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Grimmett, Geoffrey\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = British fencer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1950-12-20\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Birmingham]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grimmett, Geoffrey}}\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century English mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century English mathematicians]]\n[[Category:British fencers]]\n[[Category:Olympic fencers of Great Britain]]\n[[Category:Fencers at the 1976 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Fellows of Churchill College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Fellows of New College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Members of the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Merton College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Probability theorists]]\n[[Category:English statisticians]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Masters of Downing College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:People educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham]]\n\n\n{{UK-mathematician-stub}}\n{{UK-statistician-stub}}\n{{UK-fencing-bio-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Geoffrey Grimmett"}}}}
