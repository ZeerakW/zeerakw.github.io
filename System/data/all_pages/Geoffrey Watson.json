He studied at the [[University of Melbourne]], and received his PhD at the [[North Carolina State University]] in 1951. After taking positions at the [[University of Melbourne]], the [[Australian National University]], the [[University of Toronto]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]], he became chair of the Department of Statistics of [[Princeton University]] in 1970. He remained there until his death.\n\nWatson developed the [[Durbin–Watson statistic]] for detecting [[autocorrelation]] with [[James Durbin]] of the [[London School of Economics]] in 1950.\n\nWatson was especially interested in applications of statistics. He used statistical methods to support the theory of [[continental drift]]. He estimated the size of the [[penguin]] population in [[Antarctica]], and the effect of repealing the [[motorcycle helmet]] law in the United States.\n\nHe is sometimes confused with the mathematician [[G. L. Watson]], who worked on quadratic forms, and [[G. N. Watson]], a mathematical analyst.\n\n==References==\n\n* Princeton University, ''[http://www.princeton.edu/pr/news/98/q1/0107-watson.html Professor of Statistics, Emeritus, Geoffrey S.
