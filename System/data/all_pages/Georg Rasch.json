He studied with [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]] and also briefly with [[Ragnar Frisch]], and was elected a member of the [[International Statistical Institute]] in 1948.\n\nIn 1919, Rasch began studying mathematics at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He completed a masters degree in 1925 and received a doctorate in science with thesis director [[Niels Erik Nørlund]] in 1930.<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=77126}}</ref> Rasch married in 1928. Unable to find work as a mathematician in the 1930s, he turned to work as a statistical consultant. In this capacity he worked on a range of problems, including problems of biological growth.\n\n==Contributions to psychometrics==\n\nGeorg Rasch is best known for his contributions to psychometrics. His work in this field began when he used the [[Poisson distribution]] to model the number of errors made by students when reading texts. He referred to the model as the multiplicative Poisson model.\n\nHe later developed the [[Rasch model]] for dichotomous data, which he applied to response data derived from intelligence and attainment tests including data collected by the Danish military. At the same epoch, [[United States|American]] scientists independently developed [[item response theory]] (IRT). Within IRT, the Rasch model is one of the most simple response models. In contrast to other simple models, the Rasch model has a distinctive mathematical property: the model parameters (item difficulties, examinee ability) are [[sufficient statistics]]. Rasch demonstrated that his approach met criteria for measurement deduced from an analysis of measurement in the physical sciences. He also proposed generalizations of his model (Rasch, 1960/1980, 1977).\n\nToday, the Rasch model is used extensively in assessment in education and [[educational psychology]], particularly for attainment and cognitive assessments.\n\n==Major publications==\nRasch, G.
