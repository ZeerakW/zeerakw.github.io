His father was a [[cabinet maker]] and his mother had been a [[domestic servant]]. George's sister [[Dorothy Wedderburn]] became a sociologist and eventually Principal of [[Royal Holloway, University of London]]. George attended the local grammar school, the [[Sir George Monoux College|Monoux School]], and from there he won a scholarship to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] to read mathematics. In 1937 he went on to [[Princeton University]] to do graduate work on mathematical logic with [[Alonzo Church]].\n\nBarnard was on holiday in Britain when the [[Second World War]] started and he never went back to Princeton to finish his PhD. The war made Barnard into a statistician as it did for many mathematicians of his generation. In 1940 he joined an engineering firm, [[Plessey]], as a mathematical consultant. In 1942 he moved to the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] to apply quality control and sampling methods to the products for which they were responsible. It was there that Barnard began doing statistics. The group he was put in charge of included [[Peter Armitage]], [[Dennis Lindley]] and [[Robin Plackett]]. Lindley recalls that they were like students working for a doctorate with Barnard as supervisor. [[Abraham Wald]] was in a similar group in the United States. Both groups developed sequential methods of sampling.\n\nAt the end of the war, Barnard went to [[Imperial College London]], as a lecturer, becoming a reader in 1948 and professor of mathematical statistics in 1954. In 1966 he moved to the newly created [[University of Essex]], from which he retired in 1975. Barnard, however, kept on doing statistics until he died aged 86. Until 1981 he spent much of each year at the [[University of Waterloo]], [[Canada]], and after that he continued writing papers and corresponding with colleagues all over the world.\n\nBarnard's best known contribution is probably his 1962 paper on likelihood inference but the paper he thought his best was the 1949 paper in which he first espoused the [[likelihood principle]]. He had originally described the principle in the context of optional stopping. A statement by [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] brings out how surprising the principle first seemed (''Foundations of Statistical Inference'', 1961, p.&nbsp;75)\n<blockquote>\nI learned the [[stopping rule]] principle from Professor Barnard in ... 1952. Frankly, I then thought it a scandal that anyone in the profession could advance an idea so patently wrong, even as today I can scarcely believe that some people resist an idea so patently right.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn an interview Barnard recalled, \"my main interest above everything was politics from about 1933 until 1956. Well, that’s not true—until the end of the war it would be fair to say.\"\n\nAt school he proposed the motion to the school debating society that \"Socialism is preferable to Capitalism.\" He joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] in 1933 and he took part in anti-fascist marches in the east end of London.\n\nA fellow activist recalls him as a\n\"lean-and-and-hungry-looking mathematician from a working class family\" who served as the \"student Party's chief local commissar.\"<ref>Eric Hobsbawm, ''Interesting Times'' (2002) p 116</ref>  At Plessey he was chairman of the shop stewards.\n\nBarnard served terms as president of three societies, the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1971-2, the Operational Research Society in 1962-4 and the [[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]] in 1970-1. He was awarded the [[Guy Medal]] in Gold by the Royal Statistical Society in 1975.\n\nIn May 1986 Barnard was awarded an [[honorary degree]] by the [[Open University]] as Doctor of the University and in 1994 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the [[University of Essex]].\n\nLindley wrote in ''The Statistician'', \"We have lost a great statistician and a delightful human being.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nHe married first, Helen J. B. Davis in 1942 and they had three sons. He married second, Mary M. L. Jones in 1949 and they had one son.<ref name =\"WWW\">[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U6527 ''BARNARD, Prof. George Alfred'', Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920–2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007, accessed 11 Nov 2012]</ref> He was the brother of the social scientist [[Dorothy Wedderburn]].\n\n==Publications==\n*G A Barnard (1945) \"A New Test for 2X2 Tables\", ''Nature'', 156, 177 & 783.\n*G A Barnard (1946) \"Sequential Tests in Industrial Statistics\", ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' Supplement, 8, 1-26.\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Barnard | first1 = G A | year = 1949 | title = Statistical Inference | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 115–149 }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Barnard | first1 = G A | year = 195 | title = Control charts and stochastic processes | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B | volume = B | issue = 21 | pages = 239–71 }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Barnard | first1 = G A | authorlink2 = Gwilym Jenkins | last2 = Jenkins | first2 = G.M. | last3 = Winsten | first3 = C.B. | year = 1962 | title = Likelihood Inference and Time Series | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A | volume = 125 | issue = 3| pages = 321–372 | doi = 10.2307/2982406 }}\nThere is a bibliography (containing 109 articles) up to 1989:\n*Seymour Geisser et al.

The volume was one of a series honouring Bayesian heroes.\nIn 1990 he made a book out of manuscripts left by his friend Egon Pearson:\n*[[E. S. Pearson]] (1990) ''‘Student’, A Statistical Biography of William Sealy Gosset,'' Edited and Augmented by R. L. Plackett with the Assistance of G. A. Barnard, Oxford: University Press.\nAfter 1990 Barnard published little, although he kept up his letter writing. In 1996 however he produced a review of Barndorff-Nielsen and Cox After observing that, \"A great virtue of the book is that it raises perhaps as many questions as it answers,\" Barnard went on to give his answer to one of those questions:\n*Review of Inference and Asymptotics. by O.
