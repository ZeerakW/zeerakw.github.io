Dantzig's parents met during their study at the [[Sorbonne University]] in [[Paris]], where Tobias studied mathematics under [[Henri Poincaré]], after whom Dantzig's brother was named.<ref name=\"mmp\"/> The Dantzigs immigrated to the [[United States]], where they settled in Portland, Oregon.\n\nEarly in the 1920s the Dantzig family moved from [[Baltimore]] to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. His mother became a linguist at the [[Library of Congress]], and his father became a math tutor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], George attended Powell Junior High School and Central High School; one of his friends there was [[Abraham Seidenberg]], who also became a professional mathematician.<ref name=\"mmp\"/> By the time he reached high school he was already fascinated by geometry, and this interest was further nurtured by his father, challenging him with complicated problems, particularly in [[projective geometry]].<ref name= \"JH05\"/><ref name=\"mmp\"/>\n\nGeorge Dantzig earned [[bachelor's degrees]] in mathematics and physics from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in 1936, and his master's degree in mathematics from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1938. After a two-year period at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, he enrolled in the doctoral program in mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he studied statistics under [[Jerzy Neyman]].\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War II]], George took a leave of absence from the doctoral program at Berkeley to join the [[U.S. Air Force]] Office of Statistical Control. In 1946, he returned to Berkeley to complete the requirements of his program and received his [[Ph.D.]] that year.<ref name = \"SR06\"/> Although he had a faculty offer from Berkeley, he returned to the Air Force as mathematical advisor to the comptroller.<ref name=\"mmp\"/>\n\nIn 1952 Dantzig joined the mathematics division of the [[RAND Corporation]]. By 1960 he became a professor in the [[University of California, Berkeley College of Engineering|Department of Industrial Engineering]] at UC Berkeley, where he founded and directed the Operations Research Center. In 1966 he joined the Stanford faculty as Professor of Operations Research and of Computer Science. A year later, the Program in Operations Research became a full-fledged department. In 1973 he founded the Systems Optimization Laboratory (SOL) there. On a sabbatical leave that year, he headed the Methodology Group at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. Later he became the C. A. Criley Professor of Transportation Sciences at [[Stanford]], and kept going, well beyond his mandatory retirement in 1985.<ref name = \"SR06\"/>\n\nHe was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Academy of Engineering]], and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. George was the recipient of many honors, including the first [[John von Neumann Theory Prize]] in 1974, the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1975,<ref>[http://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=95 National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science]</ref>  an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] in 1976. The [[Mathematical Programming Society]] honored Dantzig by creating the [[George B. Dantzig Prize]], bestowed every three years since 1982 on one or two people who have made a significant impact in the field of mathematical programming.\n\nDantzig died on May 13, 2005, in his home in [[Stanford, California]], of complications from [[diabetes]] and [[cardiovascular disease]]. He was 90 years old.<ref name= \"JH05\"/>\n\n==Work==\nFreund wrote further that \"through his research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems, [Dantzig] has contributed more than any other researcher to the remarkable development of linear programming\".<ref name=\"RF94\">Robert Freund (1994). [http://www.stanford.edu/group/SOL/dantzig.html \"Professor George Dantzig: Linear Programming Founder Turns 80\"]. In: ''SIAM News'', November 1994.</ref>\n\nDantzig's seminal work allows the airline industry, for example, to schedule crews and make fleet assignments. Based on his work tools are developed \"that shipping companies use to determine how many planes they need and where their delivery trucks should be deployed. The oil industry long has used linear programming in refinery planning, as it determines how much of its raw product should become different grades of gasoline and how much should be used for petroleum-based byproducts. It is used in manufacturing, revenue management, telecommunications, advertising, architecture, circuit design and countless other areas\".<ref name= \"JH05\"/>\n\n===Mathematical statistics===\nAn event in Dantzig's life became the origin of a famous story in 1939 while he was a graduate student at [[UC Berkeley]]. Near the beginning of a class for which Dantzig was late, professor [[Jerzy Neyman]] wrote two examples of famously unsolved [[statistics]] problems on the blackboard. When Dantzig arrived, he assumed that the two problems were a homework assignment and wrote them down. According to Dantzig, the problems \"seemed to be a little harder than usual\", but a few days later he handed in completed solutions for the two problems, still believing that they were an assignment that was overdue.<ref name=\"mmp\"/><ref name=snopes>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/college/homework/unsolvable.asp |publisher=Snopes |title=The Unsolvable Math Problem |date=June 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSix weeks later, Dantzig received a visit from an excited professor Neyman, who was eager to tell him that the homework problems he had solved were two of the most famous unsolved problems in statistics.<ref name= \"JH05\"/><ref name=\"mmp\"/> He had prepared one of Dantzig's solutions for publication in a mathematical journal.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dantzig|first1=George|title=On the non-existence of tests of\" Student's\" hypothesis having power functions independent of σ|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|date=1940|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177731912|volume=11|pages=186–192}}</ref> As Dantzig told it in a 1986 interview in the ''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'':<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://rev-inv-ope.univ-paris1.fr/files/26305//IO-26305-1.pdf |title=Professor George Bernard Dantzig,  Life & Legend |first1=Sira M. |last1=Allende |first2=Carlos N. |last2=Bouza |journal=Revista Investigación Operacional |year=2005 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=205–11}}</ref>\n<blockquote>A year later, when I began to worry about a thesis topic, Neyman just shrugged and told me to wrap the two\nproblems in a binder and he would accept them as my thesis.</blockquote>\n\nYears later another researcher, [[Abraham Wald]], was preparing to publish a paper which arrived at a conclusion for the second problem, and included Dantzig as its co-author when he learned of the earlier solution.<ref name=\"mmp\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dantzig|first1=George|last2=Wald|first2=Abraham|title=On the Fundamental Lemma of Neyman and Pearson|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|date=1951|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177729695|accessdate=14 October 2014|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177729695|volume=22|pages=87–93}}</ref>\n\nThis story began to spread, and was used as a motivational lesson demonstrating the power of positive thinking.  Over time Dantzig's name was removed and facts were altered, but the basic story persisted in the form of an urban legend, and as an introductory scene in the movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''.<ref name=snopes/>\n\n===Linear programming===\n[[Linear programming]] is a mathematical method for determining a way to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a given [[mathematical model]] for some list of requirements represented as linear relationships. Linear programming arose as a mathematical model developed during [[World War II]] to plan expenditures and returns in order to reduce costs to the army and increase losses to the enemy. It was kept secret until 1947. Postwar, many industries found its use in their daily planning.\n\nThe founders of this subject are  [[Leonid Kantorovich]], a Russian mathematician who developed linear programming problems in 1939, Dantzig, who published the [[Simplex algorithm|simplex method]] in 1947, and [[John von Neumann]], who developed the theory of the [[duality (optimization)|duality]] in the same year.\n\nDantzig's original example of finding the best assignment of 70 people to 70 jobs exemplifies the usefulness of [[linear programming]]. The computing power required to test all the permutations to select the best assignment is vast; the number of possible configurations exceeds the number of particles in the universe. However, it takes only a moment to find the optimum solution by posing the problem as a linear program and applying the Simplex algorithm. The theory behind linear programming drastically reduces the number of possible optimal solutions that must be checked.\n\nIn 1963, Dantzig’s ''Linear Programming and Extensions'' was published by [[Princeton University Press]]. Rich in insight and coverage of significant topics, the book quickly became “the bible” of linear programming.\n\n==Publications==\nBooks by George Dantzig:\n* 1953. ''Notes on linear programming''.
