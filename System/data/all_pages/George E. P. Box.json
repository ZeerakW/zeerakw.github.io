Upon entering university he began to study [[chemistry]], but was called up for service before finishing. During [[World War&nbsp;II]], he performed experiments for the [[British Army]] exposing small animals to poison gas. To analyze the results of his experiments, he taught himself statistics from available texts. After the war, he enrolled at [[University College London]] and obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics and statistics. He received a Ph.D. from the [[University of London]] in 1953, under the supervision of [[Egon Pearson]].<ref name=mathgene/><ref name=mactutor>{{MacTutor|id=Box}}</ref>\n\n==Career and research==\nFrom 1948 to 1956, Box worked as a statistician for [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI). While at ICI, he took a leave of absence for a year and served as a visiting professor at the North Carolina State University at Raleigh (now [[North Carolina State University]]). He later went to [[Princeton University]] where he served as Director of the Statistical Research Group.\n\nIn 1960, Box moved to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] to create the Department of Statistics. He was appointed Vilas Research Professor of Statistics (the highest honor accorded to any faculty member at the University of Wisconsin–Madison) in 1980.<ref>[http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ie/faculty/box_george.html George Box University of Wisconsin–Madison home page]</ref> Box and Bill Hunter co-founded the Center for Quality and Productivity Improvement at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1984. Box officially retired in 1992, becoming an [[Emeritus Professor]].\n\nBox published books including ''Statistics for Experimenters'' (2nd ed., 2005), ''Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control'' (4th ed., 2008, with [[Gwilym Jenkins]] and Gregory C. Reinsel) and ''Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis.'' (1973, with George C. Tiao).\n\n==Awards and honours==\nBox served as President of the [[American Statistical Association]] in 1978 and of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]] in 1979. He received the [[Shewhart Medal]] from the [[American Society for Quality Control]] in 1968, the [[Wilks Memorial Award]] from the [[American Statistical Association]] in 1972, the [[R.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Fisher Lectureship]] in 1974, and the [[Guy Medal]] in Gold from the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1993. Box was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1974 and a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1985|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1985]].<ref name=frs/>\n\nHis name is associated with results in statistics such as [[Box–Jenkins]] models, [[Box–Cox transformation]]s, [[Box–Behnken design]]s, and others. Box wrote that \"essentially, [[all models are wrong]], but some are useful\" in his book on [[response surface methodology]] with Norman&nbsp;R. Draper.<ref>Box, George E. P.; Norman R. Draper (1987). ''Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces'', p. 424, Wiley. ISBN 0-471-81033-9. [[q:George Box|(more details at wikiquote)]]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBox married Joan Fisher, the second of [[Ronald Fisher|Ronald Fisher's]] five daughters. In 1978, Joan Fisher&nbsp;Box published a biography of [[Ronald Fisher]], with substantial collaboration of Box.<ref>Box, Joan Fisher (1978) ''R. A.
