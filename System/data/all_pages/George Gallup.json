Gallup.jpg|thumb|right|Grave in Princeton Cemetery]]\nGallup was born in [[Jefferson, Iowa]]. He was the son of George Henry Gallup, a dairy farmer. As a teen, George Jr., known then as \"Ted\", would deliver milk and used his salary to start a newspaper at the high school, where he also played football. His higher education took place at the [[University of Iowa]], where he was a football player, a member of the Iowa Beta chapter of the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity, and editor of ''[[The Daily Iowan]]'', an independent newspaper which serves the university campus. He earned his B.A. in 1923, his M.A. in 1925 and his Ph.D. in 1928.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Everett M.|title=Iowa School of Journalism|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/simon052/93043281.html|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe then moved to [[Des Moines, Iowa]], where he served as head of the Department of Journalism at [[Drake University]] until 1931. That year, he moved to [[Evanston, Illinois]], as a professor of journalism and advertising at [[Northwestern University]]. The next year, he moved to [[New York City]] to join the advertising agency of Young and Rubicam as director of research (later as vice president from 1937 to 1947). He was also professor of journalism at [[Columbia University]], but he had to give up this position shortly after he formed his own polling company, the American Institute of Public Opinion (Gallup Poll), in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Gallup Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Fi-Gi/Gallup-George.html|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nGallup is often credited as the developer of public polling. In 1932, Gallup did some polling for his mother-in-law, [[Ola Babcock Miller]], a candidate who was a long-shot from winning a position as [[Iowa Secretary of State]]. With the Democratic landslide of that year, she won a stunning victory, furthering Gallup's interest in politics.<ref>[http://uipress.lib.uiowa.edu/bdi/DetailsPage.aspx?id=271 The Biographical Dictionary of Iowa-Eunice Viola Babcock Miller]</ref>\n\nIn 1936, his new organization achieved national recognition by correctly predicting, from the replies of only 50,000 respondents, that [[Franklin Roosevelt]] would defeat [[Alf Landon]] in the U.S. Presidential election. This was in direct contradiction to the widely respected ''[[Literary Digest]]'' magazine whose poll based on over two million returned questionnaires predicted that Landon would be the winner. Not only did Gallup get the election right, he correctly predicted the results of the ''Literary Digest'' poll as well using a random sample smaller than theirs but chosen to match it.\n\nTwelve years later, his organization had its moment of greatest ignominy, when it predicted that [[Thomas Dewey]] would defeat [[Harry S. Truman]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 election]], by five to fifteen percentage points. Gallup believed the error was mostly due to ending his polling three weeks before Election Day.\n\nIn 1947, he launched the [[Gallup International Association]], an international association of polling organizations.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3n5BA5Z_Of0C&pg=PA111| author=Wolfgang Donsbach and Michael W. Traugott| title=The SAGE handbook of public opinion research| publisher=Social Science| year=2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, with [[Claude E. Robinson]], he founded [[Gallup and Robinson]], Inc., an [[advertising research]] company.\n\nIn 1958, Gallup grouped all of his polling operations under what became [[The Gallup Organization]].\n\nGallup died in 1984 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at his summer home in [[Tschingel]], a village in the [[Bernese Oberland]] of [[Switzerland]]. He was buried in [[Princeton Cemetery]]. His wife died in 1988, and their son, writer and pollster [[George Gallup, Jr.]], died in 2011.<ref name=dfp>{{cite news|title=N.Y.
