He was initially a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], then a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] before joining the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] by the time of the 1895 [[General Election]].\n\nWhile [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], in 1888 he introduced the [[Goschen formula]] to allocate funding for Scotland and Ireland.\n\n==Background, education and business career==\nHe was born in [[London]] the son of William Henry Goschen, a merchant of German extraction. He was educated at [[Rugby School|Rugby]] under [[Archibald Campbell Tait|Tait]], and at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], where he took a first in [[classics]]. He entered his father's firm of Fruhling & Goschen, of Austin Friars, in 1853, and three years later became a director of the [[Bank of England]].\n\n==Political career, 1863–1885==\nIn 1863 he was returned without opposition as one of the four [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] interest, and he was reelected in 1865. In November of the same year he was appointed [[President of the Board of Trade|Vice-President of the Board of Trade]] and [[Paymaster-General]], and in January 1866 he was made [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], with a seat in the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. When [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] in December 1868, Goschen joined the cabinet as [[President of the Poor Law Board]], until March 1871, when he succeeded [[Hugh Childers|Childers]] as [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]]. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|1874 general election]] he was the only Liberal returned for the City of London, and by a narrow [[majority]]. Being sent to [[Cairo]] in 1876 as delegate for the British holders of Egyptian [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] in 1876, he concluded an agreement with the [[Khedive]] in order to arrange for the conversion of the debt.\n\nIn 1878 his views on the county [[Suffrage|franchise]] question prevented him from voting consistently with his party. With the City of London becoming more Conservative, Goschen did not stand there at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 general election]], but was instead returned for [[Ripon (UK Parliament constituency)|Ripon]] in Yorkshire, which he represented until 1885, when he was returned for the [[Edinburgh East (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastern Division of Edinburgh]]. He declined to join Gladstone's government in 1880 and also refused the post of [[Viceroy of India]], but he did become special ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire|Porte]], where he settled the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] and [[Greece|Greek]] frontier questions in 1880 and 1881. He was made an [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners|Ecclesiastical Commissioner]] in 1882. When [[Henry Brand|Sir Henry Brand]] was raised to the [[peerage]] in 1884, Goschen was offered the role of [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]], but he declined. During the parliament of 1880–1885 he frequently found himself at odds with his party, especially over franchise extension and questions of [[foreign policy]]. When Gladstone adopted [[Irish Home Rule|Home Rule for Ireland]], Goschen followed [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Lord Hartington]] (afterwards 8th Duke of Devonshire) and became one of the most active of the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]]. He failed to retain his seat for Edinburgh at the election in July of that year.\n\n==Political career, 1885–1895==\nOn the resignation of [[Lord Randolph Churchill]] in December 1886, Goschen, though a Liberal Unionist, accepted [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury's]] invitation to join his [[The Ministry|ministry]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Churchill had assumed he could not be replaced, and famously commented that he had \"forgotten Goschen\" was a potential alternative. Goschen needed a seat in Parliament and so first stood in a [[by-election]] in the [[Liverpool Exchange (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Exchange constituency]], but was defeated by seven votes in January 1887. He was then elected for the strongly Conservative [[Westminster St George's (UK Parliament constituency)|St George's, Hanover Square]], in February. His chancellorship was memorable for his successful conversion of the [[National Debt]] in 1888. He also introduced the first UK road tax, implemented in the form of two vehicle duties, on locomotives and carts. <ref name=\"t_18880327\">{{cite news |title=The speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer |date=27 March 1888  |publisher=The Times}}</ref><ref name=\"t_18880507\">{{cite news |title=The Excise Duties (Local)  |date=27 March 1888  |publisher=The Times}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Car tax disc to be axed after 93 years|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25223631 | work=BBC News | date=5 December 2013}}</ref> \n\nThe [[University of Aberdeen]] again conferred upon him the honour of the rectorship in 1888, he received an honorary [[LL.D]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] in the same year,<ref>{{acad|id= GSCN888GJ |name=Goschen, George Joachim}}</ref> and he received a similar honour from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1890.\n\nFollowing the defeat of Salisbury's government in 1892, Goschen moved into opposition. Though he had been a leading Liberal Unionist as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Goschen did not stand against Joseph Chamberlain for the leadership of the party in 1892 following the departure of Hartington to the House of Lords as the Duke of Devonshire. Unable to work with Chamberlain, Goschen left the Liberal Unionists and joined the Conservatives in 1893. One obvious sign of his change of allegiance within the Unionist alliance was when he joined the exclusively Conservative [[Carlton Club]] in the same year.\n\n==Political career, 1895–1907==\n[[Image:goschen cartoon.png|thumb|200px|Caricature from ''Punch'', 13 August 1881: \"This is a Joke-'im picture of a Wise Man from the East, at present ascertaining which way the wind blows\"]]\nFrom 1895 to 1900 Goschen was [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]]. He retired in 1900 and was raised to the [[peerage]] as [[Viscount Goschen]] of Hawkhurst, Kent. Though retired from active politics he continued to take a great interest in public affairs, and when [[Joseph Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] started his [[Protectionism|tariff reform movement]] in 1903, Lord Goschen was one of the weightiest champions of [[free trade]] on the Unionist side.\n\n==Other public positions==\nIn educational subjects Goschen had always taken the greatest interest, his best known, but by no means his only, contribution to popular culture being his participation in the University Extension Movement. His first efforts in parliament were devoted to advocating the abolition of religious tests and the admission of [[Nonconformism|Dissenters]] to the universities. His published works indicate how ably he combined the wise study of [[economics]] with a practical instinct for business-like progress, without neglecting the more ideal aspects of human life. In addition to his well-known work on ''The Theory of the Foreign Exchanges'', he published several financial and political pamphlets and addresses on educational and social subjects, among them being that on Cultivation of the Imagination, Liverpool, 1877, and that on Intellectual Interest, Aberdeen, 1888.  He was President of the [[Royal Statistical Society]], 1886-8.\n\nHe also wrote a biography of his grandfather, ''The Life and Times of George Joachim Goschen, publisher and printer of Leipzig'' (1903).  This culminated a long-standing project to refute allegations of Jewish ancestry,<ref name=spinner>{{cite book|last=Spinner, Jnr|first=Thomas J.|title=George Joachim Goschen: The Transformation of a Victorian Liberal|year=1973|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=1}}</ref> giving his earliest ascertainable ancestor as a [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] pastor named Joachimus Gosenius, recorded in 1609.<ref name=goschen>{{cite book|last=Goschen|first=George Joachim|title=The Life and Times of Georg Joachim Goschen, printer of Leipzig 1752–1828, Volume 1|year=1903|page=3}}</ref>  (It did not apparently prevent his family being classed as of Jewish origin in the German genealogical work known as ''The Semi Gotha'', first published 1913.)<ref name=nobjews>[http://chivalricorders.org/nobility/nobjews.htm] Chivalric Orders website, which notes the veracity of some of the genealogies contained are questioned by scholars.</ref>\n\nGoschen died on 7 February 1907 and was succeeded by his son [[George Joachim Goschen, 2nd Viscount Goschen|George Joachim]] (1866&ndash;1952), who was Conservative M.P. for [[East Grinstead]] from 1895 to 1900 and married a daughter of [[Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook|Lord Cranbrook]].\n\n==Cultural references==\n* Goschen appears as a minor character in the historical-mystery novel ''[[Stone's Fall]]'', by [[Iain Pears]].\n* He is referenced in the poem 'Away from It All' by [[New Zealand]] poet [[A.
