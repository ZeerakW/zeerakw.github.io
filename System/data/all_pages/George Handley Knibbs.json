Retrieved 24 August 2009\n</ref> was an [[Australia]]n scientist, the first [[Australian Statistician|Commonwealth Statistician]] and the first director of the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, predecessor to the [[CSIRO]].\n\nKnibbs was born in [[Sydney]] son of John Handley Knibbs, foreman, and his wife Ellen, ''née'' Curthoys.<ref name=ADB/> Knibbs joined the [[New South Wales]] Land Survey Department in 1877 and in January 1878 was appointed a licensed surveyor. In 1889 Knibbs resigned to take up private practice as a surveyor, and in 1890 became lecturer in surveying at the [[University of Sydney]]. Knibbs was elected a member of the [[Royal Society of New South Wales]] in 1881, became a member of the council in 1894, from 1896 to 1906 was almost continuously honorary secretary, and in 1898-9 was president. Knibbs was also taking an active interest in other societies, and was president of the [[Institution of Surveyors]] at Sydney for four years in the period between 1892 and 1901, and president of the New South Wales branch and a fellow<ref name=ADB/> of the [[British Astronomical Society]] in 1897-8.\n\nKnibbs had begun contributing papers to the Royal Society of New South Wales at an early age, at first on matters arising out of surveying, and then on problems of physics. In his presidential address delivered on 3 May 1899 Knibbs showed that he had spent time studying mathematics. In 1902 and 1903, as a royal commissioner on education, Knibbs travelled through Europe and furnished a valuable report, which led to his being appointed Director of Technical Education for New South Wales in 1905. He was also in this year acting professor of physics at the [[University of Sydney]]. In 1906 the [[Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics]] was created and Knibbs became its first director.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] Knibbs was on the [[Royal Commission]] dealing with problems of trade and industry, and was a consulting member of the committee on munitions of war. In 1920 Knibbs played a leading role at the [[British Empire Statistical Conference]] in London. In March 1921 he was made director of the newly founded Institute of Science and Industry, a forerunner to the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO). At the 1921 meeting of the [[Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]] Knibbs was president of the Social and Statistical Science Section, and took as the subject of his address \"Statistics in regard to World and Empire development\". Two years later he was president of the association and spoke on \"Science and its service to man\". Knibbs resigned his directorship of the Institute of Science and Industry in 1926, and lived in retirement until his death of coronary vascular disease<ref name=ADB/> at [[Camberwell, Victoria]], a suburb of [[Melbourne]], on 30 March 1929. \n\nKnibbs was created a Companion of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) in 1911 and was [[knight]]ed in 1923. He contributed 29 papers to the [[Royal Society of New South Wales]], and several of his monographs, largely on statistical subjects, were published as pamphlets. In 1913 he published a volume of verse, ''Voices of the North and Echoes of Hellas'', largely translations, carefully written but not important as poetry, and in 1928 appeared a work on population, ''The Shadow of the World's Future''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=George Handley|Last=Knibbs|Link=http://gutenberg.net.au/dictbiog/0-dict-biogI-K.html#knibbs1|accessdate=2009-08-24}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Knibbs, George Handley\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Australian scientist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 13 June 1858\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 30 March 1929\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Knibbs, George Handley}}\n[[Category:1858 births]]\n[[Category:1929 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Sydney]]\n[[Category:Australian physicists]]\n[[Category:Australian public servants]]\n[[Category:Australian statisticians]]\n[[Category:Australian Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "George Handley Knibbs"}}}}
