This means that the second item occurs approximately 1/2 as often as the first, and the third item 1/3 as often as the first, and so on. Zipf's discovery of this law in 1935 was one of the first academic studies of [[word frequency]].<ref>{{citation|title=Word Frequency Distributions|volume=18|series=Text, Speech and Language Technology|first=R.

In particular, he observed that the rank vs. frequency distribution of individual incomes in a unified nation approximates this law, and in his 1941 book, \"National Unity and Disunity\" he theorized that breaks in this \"normal curve of income distribution\" portend social pressure for change or [[revolution]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Zipf–Mandelbrot law]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* Zipf, George Kingsley (1932): ''Selected Studies of the Principle of Relative Frequency in Language.''
