Hamilton]]'s work on [[kin selection]] with a new [[Price equation]]; second, introducing (with [[John Maynard Smith]]) the concept of the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS), a central concept in [[game theory]]; and third, formalising [[Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection]]. \n\nAfter converting to [[Christianity]] and giving all his possessions to the poor, he committed [[suicide]].\n\n== Early life ==\nPrice was born in 1922.  His father, an electrician, died when Price was four.  His mother was a former opera singer, and the family struggled through the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"Dugatkin-108\">{{cite book|last=Dugatkin|first=Lee Alan|title=The Altruism Equation|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=108|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=t7ydwfwLKc8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA108#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nHaving attended  [[Stuyvesant High School]] in [[New York]], Price graduated with a degree in [[chemistry]] from [[University of Chicago]] in 1943 and received his [[doctorate]] in the subject from the same institution in 1946.<ref name=\"Dugatkin-108\"/>\n\nIn 1947 he married Julia Madigan, but their relationship was contentious because George was a [[strong atheism|strong atheist]] whilst his wife was a practicing [[Roman Catholic]].<ref name=\"Dugatkin-108\"/>  They [[divorce]]d in 1955, having had two daughters, Annamarie and Kathleen.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nBetween 1946 and 1948, Price was an instructor in chemistry at [[Harvard University]] and consultant to [[Argonne National Laboratory]].  Later, he took a position at [[Bell Laboratories]] to work on the chemistry of transistors.<ref name=\":0\" />  He then worked as a research associate in [[medicine]] at the [[University of Minnesota]], working on, among other things, [[fluorescence microscopy]] and [[liver perfusion]].  In 1955 and 1956, he published two papers in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' criticising the   [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims of [[extrasensory perception]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.122.3165.359 | last=Price | first=G.R. | year=1955 | title=Science and the supernatural | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]  | volume=122 | pages=359–367 | jstor=1750914 | issue=3165|bibcode = 1955Sci...122..359P }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.123.3184.17 | last=Price | first=G.R. | year=1956 | title=Where is the definitive experiment? | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=123 | pages=17–18 | jstor=1750107 | issue=3184|bibcode = 1956Sci...123...17P }}</ref>\n\nContinuing with science journalism, he tried to write a book entitled ''No Easy Way'' about the [[United States]]' [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] but complained that \"the world kept changing faster than I could write about it\", and so the book was never finished.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1967, Price was employed by [[IBM]] as a consultant on graphic data processing.  In 1966 he was treated for [[thyroid cancer]], but the operation to remove the tumour left his shoulder partially paralysed and left him reliant on [[thyroxine]] medication.  With the money from his [[medical insurance]], he moved to the [[United Kingdom]] to start a new life in November 1967.\n\n===To Britain===\n[[W.D.

Norton]], ISBN 978-0-393-06778-1</ref> Price had a religious experience and became an ardent scholar of the [[New Testament]].  He believed that there had been too many [[coincidence]]s in his life.  In particular, he wrote a lengthy essay entitled ''The Twelve Days of Easter'', arguing that the calendar of events surrounding [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]]'s death in [[Easter|Easter Week]] was actually slightly longer.  Later he turned away from [[Biblical scholarship]] and instead dedicated his life to community work, helping the needy of [[North London]].\n\n===Other work in evolutionary theory===\nPrice developed a new interpretation of [[Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection]], the [[Price equation]], which has now been accepted as the best interpretation of a formerly enigmatic result.<ref name=\"price1972\"/>  He wrote what is still widely held to be the best mathematical, biological and evolutionary representation of [[altruism]]. He also pioneered the application of [[game theory]] to evolutionary biology, in a co-authored 1973 paper with John Maynard Smith.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/246015a0 | authorlink=John Maynard Smith | last1=Maynard Smith | first1=J. | last2=Price | first2=G.R. | year=1973 | title=The logic of animal conflict | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=246 | pages=15–18 | issue=5427 | bibcode=1973Natur.246...15S}}</ref> Furthermore, Price reasoned that in the same way as an organism may sacrifice itself and further its genes ([[altruism]]) an organism may sacrifice itself to eliminate others of the same species if it enabled closely related organisms to better propagate their related genes. This negative altruism was described in a paper published by W. D. Hamilton and is termed [[Hamiltonian spite]].\n\nPrice’s 'mathematical' theory of altruism reasons that organisms are more likely to show altruism toward each other as they become more genetically similar to each other. As such, in a species that requires two parents to reproduce, an organism is most likely to show altruistic behavior to a biological parent, full sibling, or direct offspring. The reason for this is that each of these relatives’ genetic make up contains (on average in the case of siblings) 50% of the genes that are found in the original organism. So if the original organism dies as a result of an altruistic act it can still manage to propagate its full genetic heritage as long as two or more of these close relatives are saved. Consequently, an organism is less likely to show altruistic behavior to a biological grandparent, grandchild, aunt/uncle, niece/nephew or [[half-sibling]] (each contain one-fourth of the genes found in the original organism); and even less likely to show altruism to a [[first cousin]] (contains one-eighth of the genes found in the original organism). The theory then holds that the further genetically removed two organisms are from each other the less likely they are to show altruism to each other. If true then altruistic (kind) behavior is not truly selfless and is instead an adaptation that organisms have in order to promote their own genetic heritage.\n\n===Helping the homeless===\nPrice grew increasingly depressed by the implications of his equation. As part of an attempt to prove his theory right or wrong Price began showing an ever increasing amount (in both quality and quantity) of [[random kindness]] to complete strangers. As such Price dedicated the latter part of his life to helping the [[homeless]], often inviting homeless people to live in his house. Sometimes, when the people in his house became a distraction, he slept in his office at the [[Galton Laboratory]]. He also gave up everything to help alcoholics, yet as he helped them some stole his belongings, and he increasingly fell into depression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nHe was eventually thrown out of his rented house due to a construction project in the area, which made him unhappy because he could no longer provide housing for the homeless. He moved to various [[Squatting|squats]] in the North London area, and became depressed over Christmas, 1974.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==Death==\nUnable to prove his theory right or wrong, Price committed suicide on January 6, 1975. His body was identified by his close colleague W.D. Hamilton.<ref name=\"AndrewBrown2000\">{{cite book | last= Brown| first= Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Brown (writer)| title= The Darwin Wars: The Scientific Battle for the Soul of Man| year = 2000| publisher= [[Touchstone Books]]| location= London |isbn= 0-684-85145-8| page= 1}}</ref>\n\nA memorial service was held for Price in [[Euston]].  The only persons present from academia were Hamilton and Maynard Smith, the other few mourners being those who had come to know him through his community work. He is buried in an unmarked grave in [[St. Pancras and Islington Cemetery|St Pancras' Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Harman | first=O. | year=2010 | title=The Price of Altruism: George Price and the Search for the Origins of Kindness |publisher  = W.

This has changed in recent years. An article by James Schwartz published in 2000 was the beginning of the historical redress. More recently, [[Oren Harman]]'s [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize#Science and technology|LA Times Book Prize]] winning biography, ''The Price of Altruism: George Price and the Search for the Origins of Kindness'', has received major attention, finally bringing George Price and his story to the general public. A stage play about Price, ''The Altruists'' by Craig Baxter, won the fourth [[Scientists, Technologists and Artists Generating Exploration|STAGE]] International Script Competition.<ref>[http://www.stage.ucsb.edu/competition/winners/fourth/the_altruists.php THE ALTRUISTS, by Craig Baxter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==In media==\n*The story of Price's equation, its application to altruism, and the profound effects this supposedly had on its discoverer's life were featured in an episode of ''[[Dark Matters: Twisted But True]]'', in a segment entitled \"Killed by kindness\".\n*Similar coverage, both of Price's contributions to studies of altruism and his efforts to disprove the supposed selfishness of altruism, was discussed in \"[http://www.radiolab.org/story/103951-the-good-show/ The Good Show]\" episode of the NPR series ''[[Radio Lab]]''.\n*The life and work of Price and his work with Bill Hamilton is the central theme of the third and final documentary of the series [[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)#The Monkey In The Machine and the Machine in the Monkey|\"All watched over by Machines of Loving Grace\"]] by [[Adam Curtis]] and includes an interview with his daughter Kathleen.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.122.3165.359 | last1 = Price | first1 = G.R. | year = 1955 | title = Science and the supernatural | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 122 | issue = 3165| pages = 359–367 | jstor=1750914|bibcode = 1955Sci...122..359P }}\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.123.3184.17 | last1 = Price | first1 = G.R. | year = 1956 | title = Where is the definitive experiment? | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 123 | issue = 3184| pages = 17–18 | jstor=1750107|bibcode = 1956Sci...123...17P }}\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/227520a0 | last1 = Price | first1 = G.R. | year = 1970 | title = Selection and covariance | url = http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/W.Langdon/ftp/papers/price_nature.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 227 | issue = 5257| pages = 520–521 | pmid=5428476|bibcode = 1970Natur.227..520P }}\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-1809.1971.tb00259.x | last1 = Price | first1 = G.R. | year = 1971 | title = Extension of the [[Hardy–Weinberg principle|Hardy—Weinberg law]] to [[assortative mating]] | url = | journal = [[Annals of Human Genetics]] | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 455–458 }}\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-1809.1957.tb01874.x | last1 = Price | first1 = G.R. | year = 1972a | title = Extension of covariance selection mathematics | url = | journal = [[Annals of Human Genetics]] | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 485–490 | pmid=5073694}}\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-1809.1972.tb00577.x | last1 = Price | first1 = G.R. | authorlink2 = Cedric Smith (statistician) | last2 = Smith | first2 = C.A.B. | year = 1972b | title = Fisher's [[Malthusian parameter]] and reproductive value | url = | journal = [[Annals of Human Genetics]] | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 1–7 | pmid=4656765}}\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-1809.1972.tb00764.x | last1 = Price | first1 = G.R. | year = 1972c | title = Fisher's ''fundamental theorem'' made clear | url = | journal = [[Annals of Human Genetics]] | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 129–140 | pmid=4656569}}\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/246015a0 | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = J. | authorlink = John Maynard Smith | last2 = Price | first2 = G.R. | year = 1973 | title = The logic of animal conflict | url = | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 246 | issue = 5427| pages = 15–18 | bibcode=1973Natur.246...15S}}\n* Price, G.R.
