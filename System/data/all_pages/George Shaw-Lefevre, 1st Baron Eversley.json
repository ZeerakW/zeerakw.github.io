In her notebooks she tells amusing stories of life in the upper classes of society in England at the time, makes candid observations of contemporary people and recounts jokes she heard told. She records that she attended the funeral of her good friend Augustus Hare in 1903. The book's editor, also unnamed, says she died in 1908. Reference to \"The Times\" lists her in its report on the funeral and the death records confirm she died in 1908.\n\nAnother sister, [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]], was the first Principal of [[Somerville Hall]]; and another Rachel married [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Hamilton-Gordon]], son of the Prime Minister the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|4th Earl of Aberdeen]].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n\"The Notebooks Of A Spinster Lady\", page 290, regarding her attendance at the funeral, and page 295 where the editor records that she died five years after 1903.\nThe Times, 28 January page 10. \"Among those present at the funeral...Miss Shaw Lefevre\".\nFirst quarter 1908 her death record, East Preston folio 26 page 255.\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Hansard-contribs | mr-george-shaw-lefevre | George Shaw-Lefevre }}\n*{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p23397.htm |title= Photograph of Lord Eversley at thepeerage.com |publisher=[http://www.thepeerage.com The Peerage]}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]]\n | years  = 1863 – [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885]]\n | with   = [[Sir Francis Goldsmid, 2nd Baronet|Sir Francis Goldsmid, Bt]] to 1878\n | with2  = [[George Palmer (businessman)|George Palmer]] from 1878\n | before = [[Gillery Piggott]]<br />[[Sir Francis Goldsmid, 2nd Baronet|Sir Francis Goldsmid, Bt]]\n | after  = [[Charles Townshend Murdoch]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bradford Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford Central]]\n | years  = [[Bradford Central by-election, 1886|1886]] – [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895]]\n | before = [[William Edward Forster]]\n | after  = [[James Leslie Wanklyn]]\n}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box  | title  = [[Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty|Civil Lord of the Admiralty]]  | years  = 1866 | before = [[Lord John Hay (Royal Navy admiral of the fleet)|Lord John Hay]]  | after  = [[Charles Du Cane]]}}\n{{succession box  | title  = [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade]]  | years  = 1868–1871 | before = New office  | after  = [[Arthur Peel, 1st Viscount Peel|Arthur Peel]]}}\n{{succession box  | title  = [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]]  | years  = 1871 | before = [[Edward Knatchbull-Hugessen, 1st Baron Brabourne|Edward Knatchbull-Hugessen]]  | after  = [[Henry Winterbotham]]}}\n{{succession box  | title  = [[Secretary to the Admiralty|Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty]]  | years  = 1871–1874 | before = [[William Edward Baxter]] <br><small>(First Secretary to the Admiralty)</small>  | after  = [[Algernon Egerton|Hon.
