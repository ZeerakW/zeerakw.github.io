He is also a research professor in the department of [[computer science]] at the [[State University of New York]] in [[Stony Brook, New York]].\n\nHis artistic work includes sculpture, computer images, toys (e.g. [[Zome]]) and puzzles.  His sculptures have been featured in articles in ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref name=\"cite\"> [http://www.georgehart.com/cite/cite.html George W. Hart in the News].

He has also published over sixty academic articles.\n\nHart is a co-founder of North America's only Museum of Mathematics, [[Museum of Mathematics|MoMath]], in New York City.<ref>G. Hart et al., ''Forming a Museum of Mathematics'', in Science Exhibitions: Communication and Evaluation, ISBN 978-0-9561943-8-1</ref> As chief of content, he set the \"Math is Cool!\" tone of the museum and spent five years designing original exhibits and workshop activities for it.  \n\nHart is a coinventor on two US [[patent]]s, {{US patent|4672555}} ''Digital ac monitor'' and {{US patent|4858141}} ''Non-intrusive appliance monitor apparatus''. These patents cover, in part, an improved electrical meter for homes called [[Nonintrusive load monitoring|Nonintrusive load monitors]].  These meters track changes in voltage and current usage by a given household and then deduce which appliances are using how much electricity and when.\n\nHart received a B.S. in Mathematics from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] (1977), an M.A. in [[Linguistics]] from [[Indiana University]] (1979), and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT (1987).\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Multidimensional Analysis: Algebras and Systems for Science and Engineering'', 1995, ISBN 978-0-387-94417-3\n* ''Zome Geometry - Hands-on Learning with Zome Models'', 2001, ISBN 978-1-55953-385-0\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Sierpinski tetrahedron by George W.

The puzzle is believed to have originated with the [[philosopher]] [[Wilfrid Sellars]], and has been spread by some of his former colleagues and students, including [[Nuel Belnap]] and George W. Hart. The puzzle was also featured on WNYC's ''[[The Brian Lehrer Show]]''.<ref> The More the Merrier  ''The Brian Lehrer Show'' (Scott Page guest) April 5, 2007 WNYC [http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/episodes/2007/04/05#segment76688]</ref>\n\n===False solutions===\nGiven three foods that do not go together, it is usually because two of them don't go together. For example, [[Richard Feynman]]'s famous example of accidentally requesting milk and lemon in his tea is not a solution. While tea and lemon ''do'' go together, and tea and milk ''do'' go together, milk and lemon do ''not'' go together. For this solution to work, milk and lemon would have to go together as well.\n\nAccording to Hart, most attempted solutions tend to overlook one of the three pairs. Issues of personal taste and preparation complicate the issue, as combinations some consider acceptable sound unpalatable to others, and problems such as milk curdling with the addition of lemon juice can potentially be overcome if a [[Cheesemaker|cheesemaking]] process is employed.\n\n===Possible solutions===\nIn a posting on its website after the puzzle was aired on the WNYC radio show in New York; Beer, [[7Up]], and Whiskey was given as a solution with the statement that beer with 7Up makes [[shandy]], beer with whiskey makes a [[Boilermaker (beer cocktail)|boilermaker]] and whiskey with 7Up is a [[7 & 7]], but the three together would \"make you sick\". Other possible solutions from viewers included:\n* pie crust, raspberries and spinach\n*chocolate, peanut butter and chicken<ref>PUZZLES! April 5, 2007 Photos and Miscellany from The Brian Lehrer Show WNYC website [http://www.wnyc.org/blog/lehrer/archives/001431.html]</ref>\n\nA few of the \"classic\" solutions are:\n#Salted cucumbers, sugar, yogurt.\n#Orange juice, gin, tonic.\n#Lemon, cocoa, curry.\n#Cheese, peanut butter, Jam (AKA:Jelly)\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Conway_polyhedron_notation#Extensions_to_Conway.27s_symbols|Conway polyhedron notation]] - Created ''propellor'' and ''reflect'' operations for his artwork.\n* [[Vi Hart]], George W.
