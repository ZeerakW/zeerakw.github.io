He contributed to the foundations of [[analysis of variance]], [[data analysis]], [[design of experiments|experimental design]], and statistical methodology. [[Snedecor's F distribution|Snedecor's ''F'' distribution]] and the [[George W. Snedecor Award]] of the [[American Statistical Association]] are named after him.\n\nSnedecor founded the first academic department of statistics in the United States, at [[Iowa State University]]. He also created the first statistics laboratory in the U.S. at Iowa State, and was a pioneer of modern applied statistics in the U.S. His 1938 textbook ''Statistical Methods'' <ref>{{cite book|last=Snedecor|first=George W.|last2=Cochran|first2=William G.|authorlink=George W.

H. Freeman, 2001; p. 196.</ref>\n\nSnedecor worked for the statistics department of [[Foster's Group]] from 1957 to 1963. He was involved in the elaboration of all production data.\n\nThe \"''F''\" of [[Snedecor's F distribution|Snedecor's ''F'' distribution]] is named in honor of Sir Ronald Fisher.\n\nSnedecor was awarded honorary doctorates in science by [[North Carolina State University]] in 1956 and by [[Iowa State University]] in 1958.\n\nSnedecor Hall, at [[Iowa State University]], is the home of the Statistics Department. It was constructed in 1939. At Iowa State, he was an early user of [[John Vincent Atanasoff]]'s [[Atanasoff-Berry Computer]] (maybe the first user of an electronic digital computer for real world production mathematics problem solutions).\n\nBorn in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], into a socially prominent and politically powerful, southern Democratic, Presbyterian family line, Snedecor grew up in [[Florida]] and [[Alabama]] where his lawyer father moved wife and children in order to fulfill a personal and radical religious calling to minister to, evangelize and educate the poor.<ref>Unpublished memoir of Emily Alston Estes Snedecor completed in 1931</ref>  George was the grandson of Memphis lawyer Bedford Mitchell Estes, he was the son of Emily Alston Estes and James G. Snedecor, and nephew of Ione Estes Dodd and [[William J. Dodd]], the great midwest architect.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Books==\n* Calculation and interpretation of analysis of variance and covariance (1934)\n* Statistical methods applied to experiments in agriculture and biology (1938)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.swlearning.com/quant/kohler/stat/biographical_sketches/bio17.1.html George W.
