In the same year of 1945 Cox became the editor of ''Biometrics Bulletin'' and of ''[[Biometrics (journal)|Biometrics]]'' and she held this editorship for 10 years. In 1947 she was a founder member of the [[International Biometric Society]].<ref name=\"Bailey1994\"/>\n\nIn 1950 she published a joint work with William Cochran, ''Experimental Design'',<ref name=CochranCox1950>{{cite book|last1=Cochran|first1=William G.|last2=Cox|first2=Gertrude M.|title=Experimental Designs|date=1950|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}</ref> which became the major reference work on the [[design of experiments]] for statisticians for years afterwards.\n\nIn 1960 she took up her final post as Director of Statistics at the [[Research Triangle Institute]] in Durham, North Carolina.
