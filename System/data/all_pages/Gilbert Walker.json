Walker studied mathematics and applied it to a variety of fields including aerodynamics, electromagnetism and the analysis of time-series data before taking up a teaching position at Cambridge University. Although he had no experience in meteorology, he was recruited for a post in the Indian Meteorological Department where he worked on statistical approaches to predict the monsoons. He developed the methods in the analysis of time-series data that are now called the Yule-Walker equations. He is known for his groundbreaking description of the [[El Niño|Southern Oscillation]], a major phenomenon of global [[climate]], and for discovering what is named after him as the [[Walker circulation]], and for greatly advancing the [[climatology|study of climate]] in general. He was also instrumental in aiding the early career of the Indian mathematical prodigy, [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nHe was born in [[Rochdale]], [[Lancashire]] on 14 June 1868, the fourth child and eldest son of Thomas Walker and Elizabeth Charlotte Haslehurst. Thomas was Borough Engineer of Croydon and had pioneered the use of concrete for town reservoirs. He attended [[Whitgift School]] where he showed an interest in mathematics and got a scholarship to study at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]]. He obtained a degree in Metallurgy from [[Imperial College London]] and attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he was [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1889. His hard studies led to ill-health and he spent several winters recuperating in Switzerland where he learnt skating and became quite expert. He became a lecturer at Trinity College from 1895.<ref>{{acad|id=WLKR885GT|name=Walker, Gilbert Thomas}}</ref><ref name=\"IndianBio\" /><ref name=katz /><ref name=frs />\n\n==Career==\nWalker was an established applied mathematician at the [[University of Cambridge]] when he took up a position as assistant to the meteorological reporter in 1903. He was elevated to the position of director general of observatories in India in 1904.<ref name=\"IndianBio\">{{cite book|title=The Indian Biographical Dictionary|editor=C.

Another predecessor in the [[Indian Meteorological Department]], [[Henry Francis Blanford]], had noticed the pattern that the summer monsoon in India and Burma was correlated with the spring snow cover in the Himalayas.<ref>{{cite journal|title=On the Connexion of the Himalaya Snowfall with Dry Winds and Seasons of Drought in India |author=Blanford, H.F.|year=1884| pages=3-22| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume=37| url=http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/37/232-234/3.full.pdf}}</ref> In India, the failure of the [[Indian Ocean]] [[monsoon]] had brought severe [[famine]] to the country in 1899 and meteorology had great economic value. Walker developed Blanford's idea with quantitative rigour and came up with correlation measures (with a lag) and regression equations (or in time-series terminology, autoregression).<ref>{{cite journal| author=Walker, G.T.|year=1923| title= Correlation in seasonal variability of weather, VIII.

This is now called the [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Khandekar, M.L.| year=1991| title= Eurasian snow cover, Indian monsoon and El Niño/Southern Oscillation – a synthesis| journal= Atmosphere-Ocean| volume= 29| issue=4| pages= 636-647| doi=10.1080/07055900.1991.9649422}}</ref> He was made a Companion of the [[Order of the Star of India]] in 1911.<ref name=\"IndianBio\" />\n\nWalker also took an interest in several other fields. He made mathematical studies on bird flight and boomerangs. His interest in boomerangs came early in undergraduate years and he had earned the nickname of \"Boomerang Walker\". In Simla, he used to throw a boomerang on the grounds of Annadale attracting the attention even of the Viceroy of India.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Walker, G.|year=1897| title=On boomerangs.| journal=Phil.

He had only mixed success in his original goal, the prediction of monsoonal failures; however, his theories and broad body of supporting research represented an invaluable step forward, allowing his successors in climate study to move beyond local observation and forecasting toward comprehensive models of climate worldwide. He served as president of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] from 1926 to 1927.\n\nWalker was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1904, long before his work on meteorology on the strength of his work in applied mathematics and applications to electromagnetism.<ref name=katz /><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/aberrationandso00walkgoog#page/n6/mode/2up|title=Aberration and some other problems connected with the electromagnetic field|author=Walker, Gilbert T.|year=1900| publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> Walker, with his talent for mathematics, was among the first to recognize the abilities of the Indian mathematical prodigy [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] and wrote a letter to the University of Madras to support a scholarship.<ref>{{cite journal| journal= Bull.

He died at [[Coulsdon]], [[Surrey]] on 4 November 1958. He was 90 years old.<ref name=pen /> The Walker Institute in the United Kingdom, established to study climate, is named in his honour.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links| wikt=no | commons=no | b=no | n=no | q=no | s=no | v=no | voy=no | species=no | d=q253807}}\n*[http://www.walker-institute.ac.uk/media/GILBERT_WALKER.pdf Biography of Walker from The Walker Institute]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Walker, Gilbert Thomas\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = British meteorologist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 14 June 1868\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Rochdale]], [[Lancashire]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 4 November 1958\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Coulsdon]], [[Surrey]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walker, Gilbert Thomas}}\n[[Category:1868 births]]\n[[Category:1958 deaths]]\n[[Category:Academics of Imperial College London]]\n[[Category:British meteorologists]]\n[[Category:Companions of the Order of the Star of India]]\n[[Category:English statisticians]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n[[Category:People from Rochdale]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Royal Meteorological Society]]\n[[Category:Senior Wranglers]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Gilbert Walker"}}}}
