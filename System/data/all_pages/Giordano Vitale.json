He is best known for his theorem on [[Saccheri quadrilateral]]s. He is also referred to as '''Vitale Giordani''', '''Vitale Giordano da Bitonto''', and simply '''Giordano'''.\n\n==Life==\nGiordano was born in [[Bitonto]], in southeastern [[Italy]], probably on October 15, 1633. As an adolescent he left (or was forced to leave) his city and, after an adventurous youth (that included killing his brother-in-law for calling him lazy) he became a soldier in the Pontifical army. During these adventures he read his first book of mathematics, the ''Aritmetica prattica'' by [[Christopher Clavius|Clavius]]. At twenty-eight, living in Rome, he decided to devote himself to mathematics. The most important book he studied was [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] in the Italian translation by [[Federico Commandino|Commandino]].\n\nIn Rome he made acquaintance with the renowned mathematicians [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli|Giovanni Borelli]] and [[Michelangelo Ricci]], who became his friends. He was employed for a year as a mathematician by ex-Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] during her final stay in Rome. In 1667, a year after its foundation by [[Louis XIV]], he became a lecturer in mathematics at the [[French Academy in Rome]], and in 1685 he gained the chair of mathematics at the prestigious [[Sapienza University of Rome]]. Friend of [[Vincenzo Viviani]], Giordano met [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in Rome when Leibniz stayed there during his journey through Italy in the years 1689&ndash;90. He gave Leibniz a copy of the second edition of his book ''Euclide restituto''. Giordano died on November 3, 1711, and was buried in the [[San Lorenzo in Damaso]] basilica church in Rome.\n\n==Work==\n[[Image:Giordano Vitale theorem.svg|thumb|right|300px|Giordano's theorem]]\nGiordano is most noted nowadays for a theorem on [[Saccheri quadrilateral]]s that he proved in his 1668 book ''Euclide restituo'' (named after [[Giovanni Borelli|Borelli]]'s ''Euclides Restitutus'' of 1658).\n\nIn examining Borelli's proof of the [[parallel postulate]], Giordano noted that it depended upon the assumption that a line everywhere equidistant from a straight line is itself straight. This in turn is due to [[Clavius]], whose proof of the assumption in his 1574 ''Commentary on Euclid'' is faulty.<ref>[T. L. Heath (1908), \"The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements, Vol. 1\", p.194, University Press, Cambridge]</ref><ref>[George Bruce Halsted (1920), translator's preface to Saccheri's \"Euclides Vindicatus\", p.ix, The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago]</ref> So using a figure he found in Clavius, now called a Saccheri quadrilateral, Giordano tried to come up with his own proof of the assumption, in the course of which he proved:\n\n:If ABCD is a Saccheri quadrilateral (angles A and B right angles, sides AD and BC equal) and HK is any perpendicular from DC to AB, then\n\n:*(i) the angles at C and D are equal, and\n:*(ii) if in addition HK is equal to AD, then angles C and D are right angles, and DC is equidistant from AB.\n\nThe interesting bit is the second part (the first part had already been proved by [[Omar Khayy√°m]] in the 11th century), which can be restated as:\n\n:If 3 points of a line CD are equidistant from a line AB then all points are equidistant.\n\nWhich is the first real advance in understanding the [[parallel postulate]] in 600 years.<ref>[Roberto Bonola (1912), \"Non-Euclidean Geometry\", p.15, The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago]</ref><ref>[George Edward Martin (1998), \"The Foundations of Geometry and the Non-Euclidean Plane\", p.272, Springer]</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nGiordano's published work includes:\n\n*''Lexicon mathematicum astronomicum geometricum'' (1st edition 1668, Paris. 2nd edition with additions 1690, Rome)\n*''Euclide restituto, ovvero gli antichi elementi geometrici ristaurati e facilitati da Vitale Giordano da Bitonto.
