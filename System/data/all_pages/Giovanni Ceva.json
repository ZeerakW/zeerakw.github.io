His brother, [[Tommaso Ceva]] was also a well-known poet and mathematician.\n\n==Life==\nCeva received his education at a [[Jesuit]] college in [[Milan]]. Later in his life, he studied at the [[University of Pisa]], where he subsequently became a professor. In 1686, however, he was designated as the Professor of [[Mathematics]] at the University of Mantua and worked there for the rest of his life.\n\n==Work==\n[[Image:Ceva - De lineis rectis se invicem secantibus statica constructio, 1678 - 828340.jpg|thumb|''De lineis rectis se invicem secantibus statica constructio'', 1678]]\nCeva studied [[geometry]] for most of his long life. In 1678, he published a now famous theorem on [[synthetic geometry]] in a triangle called Ceva’s Theorem. The theorem states that if three line segments are drawn from the vertices of a triangle to the opposite sides, then the three line segments are concurrent if, and only if, the product of the ratios of the newly created line segments on each side of the triangle is equal to one. He published this new theorem in ''De lineis rectis''.\n\nCeva not only published his own theorem, but he also rediscovered and published [[Menelaus's theorem]]. He published'' Opuscula mathematica'' in 1682 and ''Geometria Motus'' in 1692, as well. In ''Geometria Motus'', he anticipated the [[infinitesimal calculus]]. Finally, Ceva wrote ''De Re Nummeraria'' in 1711, which was one of the first books in [[mathematical economics]].\n\nGiovanni Ceva also studied applications of mechanics and [[statics]] to geometric systems. At one point, however, he incorrectly resolved that the periods of [[oscillation]] of two pendulums were in the same ratio as their lengths, but he later realized and corrected the error. Ceva also worked on [[hydraulics]]. In 1728, he published ''Opus hydrostaticum'' which discusses his work in [[hydraulics]]. In fact, he used his knowledge of [[hydraulics]] to stop a project from diverting the river Reno into the river [[Po River|Po]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cevian]]\n\n==References==\n* \"Ceva, Giovanni.\" MacTutor History of Mathematics archive. 2006.
