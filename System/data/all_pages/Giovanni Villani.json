He outlined the events in his ''Cronica'' year for year, following a strictly linear narrative format.

At the same time, he participated in the crafty diplomatic tactics that resulted in peace with [[Pisa]] and [[Lucca]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia 1517\"/> As head of the [[Mint (coin)|mint]] beginning in 1316, he collected its earlier records and created a register of all the coins struck in Florence.<ref name=\"encyclopedia 1517\"/> In 1321, he was again chosen prior, and in 1324 was deputed to inspect the rebuilding of the [[city wall]]s.<ref name=\"encyclopedia 1517\">Vauchez ''et al.''

From 1329 to 1330 Villani was a [[Medieval commune|commune]]-appointed magistrate of provisioning protecting Florence from the famine's worst effects. In order to mitigate rising levels of starvation and assuage peasant discontent, grain was speedily imported from [[Sicily]] through [[Talamone]], {{nowrap|60,000 [[Italian coin florin|gold florins]]}} were taken from the city purse by the Florentine commune to aid the relief effort, and all the city's bakers had their ovens requisitioned by the government so that loaves of bread could be sold at affordable prices to the riotous and starving poor.<ref name=\"bartlett 1992 39\">Bartlett (1992), 39.</ref>\n\n[[File:PisanoDoors.jpg|thumb|Villani was the superintendent of the construction of [[Andrea Pisano]]'s bronze doors for the [[Florence Baptistry]].]]\nVillani was sent on another diplomatic mission in 1329, this time to [[Bologna]] to meet Cardinal [[Bertrand de Pouget]].<ref name=\"kleinhenz 2004 1144\"/> From 1330 to 1331 he superintended the making of [[Andrea Pisano]]'s bronze doors for the [[Florence Baptistry|Baptistry]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia 1517\"/><ref name=\"kleinhenz 2004 1144\"/> At the same time, he served as the consul for his guild of the ''Arte di Calimala'' and watched over the raising of the ''[[campanile]]'' of the [[Badia Fiorentina|Badìa]].<ref>[[Franklin Toker]] (1976), 158, footnote 10.</ref> He was also sent with others as a hostage to [[Ferrara]], to ensure that Florence made good on a debt; he resided there for some months in 1341.<ref>Michele Luzzati, ''Villani, Giovanni'', in: ''[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]]'', vol. 8, col. 1679.</ref>\n\nVillani often expressed an optimistic viewpoint in his writing; this changed with the short-lived regime of [[Walter&nbsp;VI of Brienne]], a despot invited to Florence and granted ''[[signoria]]''.<ref name=\"kleinhenz 2004 1146\">Kleinhenz (2004), 1146.</ref> In fact, after experiencing his own financial troubles, a terminated career, and the failure of Florence in international affairs, and witnessing a host of different natural calamities and the onset of the Black Death in Europe, he became convinced that the [[apocalypse]] and final judgement was near.<ref name=\"green 1967 168\"/> The bankruptcy of the Buonaccorsi Company led to Villani's conviction and imprisonment in 1346, as he was a main partner.<ref name=\"caesar 1989 147 148\">Caesar (1989), 147–148.</ref><ref>Wolfgang (1960), 150.</ref> Other banking companies also went bankrupt, such as the Peruzzi in 1343 and the [[Compagnia dei Bardi]] in 1346 (they were allied in a joint venture by 1336); Villani calculated that before their bankruptcy the Peruzzi had lost some 600,000 florins and the Bardi had lost some 900,000 florins.<ref name=\"hunt 1990 149 151\">Hunt (1990), 149 and 151.</ref> Although Villani attributed the losses to the companies' massive monetary loans to [[Edward&nbsp;III of England]] which were never repaid, historian Edwin S. Hunt suggests that the firms simply lacked the resources to have made such loans, which in all probability were much smaller and were not the key reasons for the companies' failures.<ref name=\"hunt 1990 149 150\">Hunt (1990), 149–150.</ref> The Bardi and Peruzzi were just two of many European banks that Edward&nbsp;III accepted loans from, prominent members of the Bardi and other Florentine families were owed only 63,000 Florins by Edward in 1348, and even a mass of small lenders and investors in Florence could not have made the necessary loan to England.<ref name=\"hunt 1990 155 157\">Hunt (1990), 155–157.</ref> The figure Villani asserted of 400,000 Florins owed to the Peruzzi by Edward alone equalled Villani's estimate for the entire payroll of 30,000 workers of the Florentine cloth industry in 1338.<ref name=\"hunt 1990 157\">Hunt (1990), 157.</ref> Hunt asserts that the failures of the Florentine banks seems closely tied to the expansionist policy of Florence in Tuscany, hoping that newly conquered territory would yield greater security for their trade in northern Europe, but instead resulted in costly campaigns and little profit.<ref name=\"hunt 1990 160\">Hunt (1990), 160.</ref> In addition to the questionable figures Villani posed for the Peruzzi and Bardi companies, it is also known that several events described in his ''Cronica'' surrounding the Buonaccorsi's bankruptcy were written to deliberately obscure the truth about the company's fraudulent behavior; Miller writes that \"this is one of the most convincing conclusions\" of historian Michele Luzzati's ''Giovanni Villani e la Compagnia dei Buonaccorsi'' (1971).<ref>Miller ''et al.''

(2002), 109.</ref> Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite Walter&nbsp;VI of Brienne to become the next ''[[Signoria of Florence|signor]]'' of Florence. Walter later suspended all legal actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and other company partners for nearly a year.<ref name=\"miller 2002 109\"/>\n\nHowever, the legal case against the company was reopened and resumed in October 1343, after the violent overthrow of Walter&nbsp;VI.<ref name=\"miller 2002 109\"/> It is unclear how long Villani served his prison sentence for alleged misconduct during the economic disaster of 1346. It is known that he was imprisoned in the ''Carceri delle Stinche''.<ref name=\"wolfgang 1960 149 150\">Wolfgang (1960), 149–150.</ref> After the overthrow of the Brienne regime and a subsequent but short-lived aristocratic signoria, the ''novi cives'' or new families—some even from the lesser guilds—rose up in late September 1343 and established a government that provided them with much greater representation in officialdom.<ref name=\"becker 1962 360\">Becker (1962), 360.</ref> Villani and other chroniclers disdained these rustic non-aristocrats who suddenly rose to power, considering them brazen upstarts incapable of governance.<ref name=\"baron 1960 443\">Baron (1960), 443.</ref><ref name=\"becker 1962 360 361\"/> Villani's class was at a constitutional disadvantage, as twenty-one guilds representing twenty-one equal voices in government meant that the oligarchy of higher guildsmen was \"helplessly outnumbered\" as historian John M. Najemy states.<ref name=\"najemy 1979 63\">Najemy (1979), 63.</ref> Yet by the 1350s the general attitude towards the ''novi cives'' had changed much, as even Villani's brother Matteo depicted them in a heroic light for being united in a coalition with the merchants and artisans to curb [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] power.<ref name=\"becker 1962 360 361\">Becker (1962), 360–361.</ref><ref name=\"baron 1960 443 444\">Baron (1960), 443–444.</ref> Villani was also a staunch supporter of what he deemed the liberties of the Church, while criticizing the new popular government of the ''novi cives'' since they protested against the many legal exemptions the Church enjoyed.<ref name=\"becker 1959 64 65\">Becker (1959), 64–65.</ref> However, he did find civic pride in that the whole city—including the ''novi cives''—had joined together in an uprising against Walter&nbsp;VI, whose sins of imposing tyranny were, to Villani, sufficient justification for the violence needed to overthrow him.<ref name=\"phillips 1979 89\">Phillips (1979), 89.</ref>\n\n==Nuova Cronica==\n{{main|Nuova Cronica}}\n[[File:Battle of crecy froissart.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346, from [[Froissart's Chronicles]]; Giovanni Villani wrote an accurate description of the battle and other events.<ref>De Vries (2006), 162, 173, 175.</ref>]]\nVillani's work is an [[Italian language|Italian]] chronicle written from the perspective of the political class of Florence just as the city rose to a rich and powerful position. Only scanty and partly legendary records had preceded his work, and there is little known of events before the death of [[Matilda of Tuscany|Countess Matilda]] in 1115.<ref name = \"wicksteed 1906 xxxi\"/> The ''Chronica de origine civitatis'' was composed sometime before 1231, but there is little comparison between this work and Villani's; mid-20th-century historian Nicolai Rubinstein states that the legendary accounts in this earlier chronicle were \"arbitrarily selected by a compiler whose learning and critical faculties were considerably below the standard of his age.\"<ref name=\"rubinstein 1942 199\">Rubinstein (1942), 199.</ref> In contrast, Rubinstein states Villani provided \"a mature expression\" of Florentine history.<ref name=\"rubinstein 1942 199\"/> Yet Villani still relied upon the ''Chronica de origine civitatis'' as the prime source for Florence's early history in his narrative.<ref name=\"rubinstein 1942 214\"/>\n\nIn the 36th chapter of Book 8,<ref name=\"rubinstein 1942 214\">Rubinstein (1942), 214.</ref> Villani states that the idea of writing the ''Cronica'' was suggested to him during the jubilee of Rome in 1300,<ref name=\"bartlett 1992 35\"/> under the following circumstances after [[Pope Boniface&nbsp;VIII]] made in honor of [[Nativity of Jesus|Christ's nativity]] a great indulgence; Villani writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nAnd being on that blessed pilgrimage in the sacred city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as described by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history&nbsp;... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But in view of the fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.<ref name=\"bartlett 1992 36\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn his writing, Villani states that he considers Florence to be the \"daughter and creation of Rome,\" but asserts [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Rome's decline]] and Florence's rise as a great city compelled him to lay out a detailed history of the city.<ref name=\"rubinstein 1942 214\"/> To emphasize the imperial greatness of Florentine history, Villani also asserted that the city was given a second founding when it was rebuilt by [[Charlemagne]] (r. 800–814 as [[Holy Roman Emperor]])—which was absent from the ''Chronica de origine civitatis''.<ref>Rubinstein (1942), 215–216.</ref> Historian J.K. Hyde writes that the idea of Florence being the daughter of Rome would have given the Florentines a sense of destiny, while the second founding by Charlemagne provided historical context for alliance with France, which Hyde calls \"the touchstone of [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphism]]\".<ref name=\"hyde 1979 124\">Hyde (1979), 124.</ref> Villani's reasoning for Rome's decline was the schisms of the Church and rebellion against the papal institution, while the ascension of [[Otto&nbsp;I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (r. 962–973) allowed for the conditions of Florence's rise against enemies of papal authority, such as Florentine-conquered [[Fiesole]].<ref name=\"rubinstein 1942 217\">Rubinstein (1942), 217.</ref> Villani was certain that the Republic of Florence had experienced a great setback on its path to glory with the defeat of the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphs by the Ghibellines]] at the [[Battle of Montaperti]] in 1260.<ref>Olson (1997), 289</ref> Despite this, Villani states that the paramount prosperity and tranquility of the city by 1293 was evidenced by the fact that its gates were no longer locked at night and that indirect taxes such as the gate fee (common in times of war) were not levied.<ref name=\"ratté 1999 148\">Ratté (1999), 148.</ref> Historian Felicity Ratté states that the validity of this comment should be heavily scrutinized considering the Florence statutes of 1290 that designated employment for individuals in charge of locking the city gates.<ref name=\"ratté 1999 148\"/> Villani also contradicts himself by writing of a night attack on Florence in 1323 which clearly demonstrates the fact that the gates were locked at night.<ref>Ratté (1999), 153.</ref>\n\n[[File:Kieler Hansekogge 2007 vorne.jpg|thumb|left|Villani wrote that the [[Cog (ship)|small cog type vessel]] with single mast, square sail, and stern-post [[rudder]] was introduced to the [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Venice|Venetians]] in 1304 by pirates from [[Bayonne]].<ref>Kleinhenz (2004), 1031.</ref>]]\nIn 1300 or shortly after, Villani began working on the ''Cronica'', which was divided into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, starting at conventionally biblical times with the story of the [[Tower of Babel]] up to the year 1264.<ref name=\"caesar 1989 148\">Caesar (1989), 148.</ref><ref name=\"lansing 2000 859\">Lansing et al.

In a departure from Guelph politics, he favored [[republicanism]] over [[monarchy]],<ref name=\"kleinhenz 2004 1144\"/> praising the philosopher [[Brunetto Latini]] as \"the master and initiator in refining the Florentines, in making them skilled in good speaking and in knowing how to guide and rule our republic according to political science.\"<ref>Hyde (1979), 122.</ref><ref name=\"becker 1964 201\">Becker (1964), 201.</ref> However, Villani admitted in his writing that republicanism bred factional strife, that benevolent rulers like [[Robert of Naples]] were sometimes needed to keep order, and republicanism could become tyrannical if it came to represent only one class (such as exclusive favoring of aristocrats, merchants, or artisans).<ref name=\"kleinhenz 2004 1144\"/> When detailing the construction of the [[Florence Cathedral]] and the artist [[Giotto di Bondone]] as the designer of the new bell tower, Villani called him \"the most sovereign master of painting in his time.\"<ref name=\"bartlett 1992 37\">Bartlett (1992), 37.</ref> Villani's ''Cronica'' also provides the first known biography of [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321),<ref name=\"encyclopedia 1517\"/><ref name=\"caesar 1989 xi\">Caesar (1989), xi.</ref> author of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', who Villani described as haughty, disdainful, and reserved.<ref name=\"caesar 1989 13 457\">Caesar (1989), 13, 457.</ref> In his revised ''Cronica'' of 1322, Villani shortened Dante's biography and the amount of quotations taken from his ''Divine Comedy''.<ref name=\"lansing 2000 859\"/> Villani's actions are explained by Richard H. Lansing and Teodolinda Barolini, who write: \"Evidently two decades after the poet's death a conservative writer closely identified with the Florentine state still felt obliged to distance himself from the most outspoken critic of the basis of that state's prestige.\"<ref name=\"lansing 2000 859\"/>\n\n[[File:Philippe IV le Bel.jpg|thumb|A 16th-century depiction of [[Philip&nbsp;IV of France]], one of many victims of ill fate who Villani states fell from power and grace due to sin and immorality rather than fortune or circumstance]]\nHistorian Louis Green writes that the ''Cronica'' was written with three general assumptions about morality<ref name=\"green 1967 163\">Green (1967), 163.</ref> which shaped the organization of the work, \"[channeling] events into recurring patterns of significance.\"<ref name=\"green 1967 163\"/> These general assumptions were that excess brings disaster, that history is governed by a struggle between right and wrong, and that there is a direct connection between the events of the natural world and the overriding, supernatural and divine will of God who intercedes in these events.<ref name=\"green 1967 163\"/> For example, Villani described the story of Count Ugolini of [[Pisa]], who at the height of attaining his ill-gotten wealth and power was overthrown and eventually starved to death along with his sons.<ref name=\"green 1967 163 164\">Green (1967), 163–164.</ref> Green writes that this story in the ''Cronica'' bears a resemblance to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story of [[Polycrates]] and his ring in the work of [[Herodotus]].<ref name=\"green 1967 164\">Green (1967), 164.</ref> However, Green notes that Villani's \"cautionary tales\" disembarked from the Classical Greek tradition of the arrogant and haughty rich falling from fortune due to the Greek belief in equalizing forces determining one's unavoidable fate, which Green calls \"excessive good fortune having to be balanced by an appropriate measure of sorrow.\"<ref name=\"green 1967 164\"/> Villani's adherence to Medieval Christianity allowed him to suggest retribution was delivered because of [[sin]] and insult to God.<ref name=\"green 1967 164\"/> He stressed that those who gained prestige would fall prey to pride; confidence in their position would then lead them to sin, and sin would bring on a stage of decline.<ref name=\"green 1967 165\">Green (1967), 165.</ref> Villani wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\n... it seems that it happens in the lordships and states of earthly dignitaries, that as they are at their highest peak, so presently does their decline and ruin follow, and not without the providence of divine justice, in order to punish sins and so that no one should place his trust in fallacious good fortune.<ref name=\"green 1967 164\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Giotto - Bonifatius VIII.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Boniface&nbsp;VIII]], by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]]]\nFor Villani, this theory of sin and morality being tied directly with fate and fortune fit well with the ultimate fate of the [[Capetian dynasty]] of France.<ref name=\"green 1967 165\"/> The [[House of Capet]] was once the champion of the Church and ally of the papacy.<ref name=\"green 1967 165\"/> However, Villani correlated [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]'s defiance of [[Pope Boniface&nbsp;VIII]] and seizure of the [[Knights Templar|Templar's]] wealth with later Capetian misfortunes, such as Philip's death in a hunting accident, the adultery of the wives of his three sons, the death of his heirs, and even French defeats in the Hundred Years' War.<ref name=\"green 1967 165\"/> Green points out that in Villani's writing there are two significant earthly powers that seem to be exempt or immune from this theory of immorality leading to downfall: Florence and the papacy.<ref name=\"green 1967 165 166\">Green (1967), 165–166.</ref> The interests of these two powers represent, as Green states, \"the kingpin of Villani's scheme of historical interpretation.\"<ref name=\"green 1967 165 166\"/>\n\nBesides Divine Providence, Villani acknowledged other events that he believed were explainable via the supernatural. He wrote of many instances where holy men offered prophetic statements that later proved true, such as [[Pope Clement&nbsp;IV]]'s prophecy on the outcome for the [[Battle of Tagliacozzo]].<ref name=\"green 1967 166\">Green (1967), 166.</ref> He believed that certain events were really [[omen]]s of what was to come. For instance, when a lion was sent to Florence as a gift by Boniface&nbsp;VIII, a donkey purportedly killed the lion.<ref name=\"green 1967 166\"/> He interpreted this as an omen that foretold the Pope's beating and untimely death shortly after fighting Philip&nbsp;IV at [[Anagni]]; Villani wrote: \"when the tamed beast kills the King of Beasts, then the dissolution of the Church will begin.\"<ref name=\"green 1967 166\"/> He also believed in [[astrology]] and changes in the heavens as indication of political changes, the deaths of rulers and popes, and natural calamities.<ref name=\"green 1967 167\">Green (1967), 167.</ref> However, he noted that the movement of the heavens would not always predetermine the actions of men and did not trump the divine plan of God.<ref name=\"green 1967 167\"/>\n[[File:Uccelo host burning.jpg|thumb|A scene in [[Paolo Uccello]]'s Corpus Domini [[predella]] (c. 1465–1468), set in a Jewish pawnbroker's home.
