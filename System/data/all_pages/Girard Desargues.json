The Mathematical Gazette. Vol. 34, No. 310 (Dec., 1950) p. 253</ref> [[Desargues' theorem]], the [[Desargues graph]], and the crater [[Desargues (crater)|Desargues]] on the [[Moon]] are named in his honour.\n\nBorn in [[Lyon]], Desargues came from a family devoted to service to the French crown. His father was a royal [[civil law notary|notary]], an investigating commissioner of the [[Seneschal|Seneschal's]] court in Lyon (1574), the collector of the [[tithe]]s on ecclesiastical revenues for the city of Lyon (1583) and for the [[diocese of Lyon]].\n\nGirard Desargues worked as an [[architecture|architect]] from 1645. Prior to that, he had worked as a tutor and may have served as an engineer and technical consultant in the entourage of [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]].\n\nAs an architect, Desargues planned several private and public buildings in Paris and Lyon. As an engineer, he designed a system for raising water that he installed near Paris. It was based on the use of the at the time unrecognized principle of the [[epicycloid]]al wheel.\n\nHis research on perspective and geometrical projections can be seen as a culmination of centuries of scientific inquiry across the classical epoch in optics that stretched from al-Hasan [[Ibn al-Haytham]] ([[Alhazen]]) to Johannes [[Kepler]], and going beyond a mere synthesis of these traditions with Renaissance perspective theories and practices. \n\nHis work was rediscovered and republished in 1864. A collection of his works was published in 1951,<ref>{{cite book|last=Desargues|first=Girard|title=L'oeuvre mathématique de G.

The most common theory about what this stands for is ''Des Argues, Lyonnais, Géometre'' (proposed by [[Henri Brocard]]).\n\nHe died in Lyon.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Desarguesian plane]], [[non-Desarguesian plane]]\n*[[Desargues' theorem]]\n*[[Desargues graph]]\n*[[Desargues configuration]]\n*[[Desargues (crater)]]\n* [[Perspective (graphical)]] / [[Perspective (visual)]]\n*[[Optics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* J.
