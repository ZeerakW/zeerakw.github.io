Noether Awards]] were established to \"recognize distinguished researchers and teachers and to support research in the field of nonparametric statistics.\" The initial recipients of the Gottfried E. Noether Senior Scholar Awards were [[Erich Leo Lehmann]] (2000) and [[Robert V. Hogg]] (2001), and [[Pranab K. Sen]] (2002).\n\n==References==\n<!--\nThese templates can be copied for additional references.
