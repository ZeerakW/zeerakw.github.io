J. Schoenberg Professor of [[Statistics]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. She is a pioneer in methods for [[smoothing]] noisy data. Best known for the development of generalized [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] and \"[[Wahba's problem]]\", she has developed methods with applications in [[demographic]] studies, [[machine learning]], [[DNA microarrays]], [[risk modeling]], [[medical imaging]], and [[Numerical weather prediction|climate prediction]].\n\nShe was educated at [[Cornell]] (B.A. 1956), [[University of Maryland, College Park]] (M.A. 1962) and [[Stanford]] (Ph.D. 1966), and worked in industry for several years before receiving her doctorate in 1966 and settling in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] in 1967. She is the author of ''Spline Models for Observational Data''. She was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] in 2000 and received an honorary degree of [[Doctor of Science]] from the University of Chicago in 2007.\n\n== External links ==\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=32951 }}\n* [http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~wahba/ Grace Wahba's University of Wisconsin website Home page]\n* [http://www.ec-securehost.com/SIAM/CB59.html Spline Models for Observational Data] book\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Wahba, Grace\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = August 3, 1934\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wahba, Grace}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:ISI highly cited researchers]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]]\n[[Category:University of Wisconsin–Madison faculty]]\n[[Category:Cornell University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Maryland, College Park alumni]]\n[[Category:Stanford University alumni]]\n[[Category:Bayesian statisticians]]\n[[Category:Women mathematicians]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Grace Wahba"}}}}
