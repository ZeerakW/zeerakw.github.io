In 1990, Perelman went on to earn a [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree (the Soviet equivalent to the PhD) at the same School of Mathematics and Mechanics of the [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]], one of the leading universities in the former Soviet Union, from where he had graduated. His dissertation was titled \"[[Saddle surface]]s in [[Euclidean space]]s\".\n\nAfter graduation, Perelman began work at the renowned [[St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences|Leningrad Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics]] of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]], where his advisors were [[Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov|Aleksandr Aleksandrov]] and [[Yuri Burago]]. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Perelman held research positions at several universities in the United States. In 1991 Perelman won the Young Mathematician Prize of the [[St. Petersburg Mathematical Society]] for his work on [[CAT(k) space|Aleksandrov's spaces]] of curvature bounded from below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathsoc.spb.ru/mol_mat.html|title=Young mathematician prize of the St. Petersburg Mathematical Society}}</ref> In 1992, he was invited to spend a semester each at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|Courant Institute]] in [[New York University]] and [[Stony Brook University]] where he began work on [[manifold]]s with lower bounds on [[Ricci curvature]]. From there, he accepted a two-year [[Miller Research Fellows]]hip at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1993. After having proved the [[Soul theorem|soul conjecture]] in 1994, he was offered jobs at several top universities in the US, including [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]], but he rejected them all and returned to the [[St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences|Steklov Institute in Saint Petersburg]] in the summer of 1995 for a research-only position.<ref name=nyrb/>\n\nHe has a younger sister, Elena, who is also a scientist. She received a PhD from [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in Israel and is a [[biostatistician]] at [[Karolinska Institutet]], in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.\n\n==Geometrization and Poincaré conjectures==\nUntil the autumn of 2002, Perelman was best known for his work in [[comparison theorem]]s in [[Riemannian geometry]]. Among his notable achievements was a short and elegant proof of the [[soul theorem|soul conjecture]].\n\n===The problem===\n{{Main|Poincaré conjecture}}\nThe Poincaré conjecture, proposed by French mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1904, was the most famous open problem in [[topology]]. Any [[path (topology)|loop]] on a [[3-sphere]]—as exemplified by the set of points at a distance of 1 from the origin in four-dimensional Euclidean space—can be contracted to a point. The Poincaré conjecture asserts that any closed three-dimensional [[manifold]] such that any loop can be contracted to a point is topologically a 3-sphere. The analogous result has been known to be true in dimensions greater than or equal to five since 1960 as in the work of [[Stephen Smale]].  The four-dimensional case resisted longer, finally being solved in 1982 by [[Michael Freedman]]. But the case of three-manifolds turned out to be the hardest of them all. Roughly speaking, this is because in topologically manipulating a three-manifold there are too few dimensions to move \"problematic regions\" out of the way without interfering with something else.\n\nIn 2000, the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] announced the ''[[Millennium Prize Problems]]'': $1,000,000 prizes for the proof of any of seven conjectures, including the Poincaré conjecture. There was a wide agreement that a successful proof of any of these would constitute a landmark event in the history of mathematics.\n\n===Perelman's proof===\n{{main|Poincaré conjecture}}\nIn November 2002, Perelman posted the first of a series of [[eprint]]s to the [[arXiv]], in which he claimed to have outlined a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] of the [[geometrization conjecture]], of which the [[Poincaré conjecture]] is a particular case.<ref name=perelman200211>{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications|eprint = math.DG/0211159|date=November 11, 2002|class=math.DG}}</ref><ref name=\"perelman200303\">{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=Ricci flow with surgery on three-manifolds|eprint=math.DG/0303109 | date = 10 March 2003|class=math.DG}}</ref><ref name=\"perelman200307\">{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=Finite extinction time for the solutions to the Ricci flow on certain three-manifolds|eprint= math.DG/0307245|date=July 17, 2003|class=math.DG}}</ref>\n\nPerelman modified [[Richard Hamilton (mathematician)|Richard Hamilton]]'s program for a proof of the conjecture, in which the central idea is the notion of the [[Ricci flow]]. Hamilton's basic idea is to formulate a \"dynamical process\" in which a given three-manifold is geometrically distorted such that this distortion process is governed by a differential equation analogous to the [[heat equation]]. The heat equation describes the behavior of scalar quantities such as [[temperature]]; it ensures that concentrations of elevated temperature will spread out until a uniform temperature is achieved throughout an object. Similarly, the Ricci flow describes the behavior of a [[tensor|tensorial quantity]], the [[Ricci curvature tensor]]. Hamilton's hope was that under the Ricci flow concentrations of large curvature will spread out until a uniform curvature is achieved over the entire three-manifold. If so, if one starts with any three-manifold and lets the Ricci flow occur then one should, in principle, eventually obtain a kind of \"normal form\". According to [[William Thurston]] this normal form must take one of a small number of possibilities, each having a different kind of geometry, called [[Thurston model geometry|Thurston model geometries]].\n\nThis is similar to formulating a dynamical process that gradually \"perturbs\" a given square matrix and that is guaranteed to result after a finite time in its [[rational canonical form]].\n\nHamilton's idea attracted a great deal of attention, but no one could prove that the process would not be impeded by developing \"singularities\", until Perelman's eprints sketched a program for overcoming these obstacles. According to Perelman, a modification of the standard Ricci flow, called ''[[Ricci flow with surgery]]'', can systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way.\n\nIt was known that singularities (including those that, roughly speaking, occur after the flow has continued for an infinite amount of time) must occur in many cases. However, any singularity that develops in a finite time is essentially a \"pinching\" along certain spheres corresponding to the [[prime decomposition (3-manifold)|prime decomposition]] of the 3-manifold. Furthermore, any \"infinite time\" singularities result from certain collapsing pieces of the [[JSJ decomposition]]. Perelman's work proves this claim and thus proves the geometrization conjecture.\n\n===Verification===\nSince 2003, Perelman's program has attracted increasing attention from the mathematical community. In April 2003, he accepted an invitation to visit the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Princeton University]], [[Stony Brook University]], [[Columbia University]] and [[New York University]], where he gave a series of talks on his work.<ref name=\"new yorker\">{{cite news|last1=Nasar|first1= Sylvia|last2=Gruber|first2=David|title=Manifold Destiny: A legendary problem and the battle over who solved it|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/08/28/060828fa_fact2?currentPage=all|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=August 21, 2006|accessdate=January 21, 2011|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110319235149/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/08/28/060828fa_fact2?currentPage=all|archivedate=March 19, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nThree independent groups of scholars have verified that Perelman's papers contain all the essentials for a complete proof of the geometrization conjecture:\n#On 25 May 2006, [[Bruce Kleiner]] and [[John Lott (mathematician)|John Lott]], both of the [[University of Michigan]], posted a paper on [[arXiv]] that fills in the details of Perelman's proof of the Geometrization conjecture.<ref name=\"kleiner and lott\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kleiner | first1 = Bruce | last2 = Lott | first2 = John | year = 2008 | title = Notes on Perelman's papers | url = | journal = [[Geometry & Topology]] | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 2587–2855 | doi = 10.2140/gt.2008.12.2587 |arxiv= math/0605667}}</ref> John Lott said in ICM2006, \"It has taken us some time to examine Perelman's work.

The article implies that Perelman refers particularly to the efforts of Fields medalist [[Shing-Tung Yau]] to downplay Perelman's role in the proof and play up the work of [[Huai-Dong Cao|Cao]] and [[Zhu Xiping|Zhu]]. Perelman added, \"I can't say I'm outraged. Other people do worse. Of course, there are many mathematicians who are more or less honest. But almost all of them are conformists. They are more or less honest, but they tolerate those who are not honest.\"<ref name=\"new yorker\"/> He has also said that \"It is not people who break ethical standards who are regarded as aliens.

He has said that \"As long as I was not conspicuous, I had a choice. Either to make some ugly thing or, if I didn't do this kind of thing, to be treated as a pet. Now, when I become a very conspicuous person, I cannot stay a pet and say nothing. That is why I had to quit.\" (''The New Yorker'' authors explained Perelman's reference to \"some ugly thing\" as \"a fuss\" on Perelman's part about the ethical breaches he perceived).<ref name=\"new yorkerP11\">{{cite news|last1=Nasar|first1=Sylvia|last2= Gruber|first2=David|title=Manifold Destiny: A legendary problem and the battle over who solved it|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=August 21, 2006|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/08/28/060828fa_fact2?currentPage=11|accessdate=January 21, 2011|page=11|archivedate=October 18, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20121018065507/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/08/28/060828fa_fact2?currentPage=11}}</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain whether his resignation from Steklov and subsequent seclusion mean that he has ceased to practice mathematics. Fellow countryman and mathematician [[Yakov Eliashberg]] said that, in 2007, Perelman confided to him that he was working on other things but it was too premature to talk about it. He is said to have been interested in the past in the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] and the [[Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness|set of problems]] related to them that also constitutes a Millennium Prize, and there has been speculation that he may be working on them now.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.lepoint.fr/monde/le-genie-qui-s-est-retire-du-monde-30-09-2010-1246189_24.php|title=Le génie qui s'est retiré du monde|trans_title=The genius who has withdrawn from the world|newspaper=[[Le Point]]|date=September 30, 2010|pages=74–77|language=fr|accessdate=October 15, 2010|archivedate=July 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20120721073747/http://www.lepoint.fr/monde/le-genie-qui-s-est-retire-du-monde-30-09-2010-1246189_24.php}}</ref>\n\n==Perelman and media==\nPerelman has avoided journalists and other members of the media.
