From 1989 to 1991, he was the president of the [[International Statistical Institute]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nGunnar Kulldorff was born in [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]] on 6 December 1927, as the son of Erik and Ebba Kulldorff. In 1946, he entered [[Lund University]], where he studied [[mathematics]], [[statistics]] and [[mechanics]], obtaining his bachelors degree in 1949.<ref name=\"inbjudning\">Inbjudning till doktorspromotionen vid Lunds Universitet, 1961, p.61</ref>\n\n===Scientific career===\nIn 1954 Kulldorff earned a [[Licentiate#Finland and Sweden|licentiate]] degree from the Department of Statistics at [[Lund University]].<ref name=\"inbjudning\"/> Taking a teaching positions in the same department, he did his doctoral studies under the supervision of [[Carl-Erik Quensel]] and [[Harald Cramér]]. Kulldorff's research led to a PhD in 1961 for his thesis \"Contributions to the Theory of Estimation from Grouped and Partially Grouped Samples\".<ref name=\"Kulldorff1961\">Kulldorff, 1961</ref> His thesis was republished by [[John Wiley & Sons]] as well as by the Soviet Union in a Russian translation. In a review for the [[Journal of the American Statistical Association]], [[W. Edwards Deming]] wrote that '' \"here is a book that faces reality, carrying the reader, in a modest 144 pages, on a wondrous excursion into the problems of grouped data, in which the reader cannot fail to catch the contagious enthusiasm of the author\" ''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2283353|title=Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 58, No. 304, pp. 1164-1166 | author=W. Edwards Deming|date=1963}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Kulldorff was appointed as the first professor of statistics at the newly established [[Umeå University]], where he also became the first [[dean (education)|dean]] of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In 1966, he was appointed professor of [[mathematical statistics]], a position he held until retirement.<ref name=\"Svensk Biografisk Handbok\">Svensk Biografisk Handbok, 1993, p.607</ref> During this time, he wrote papers on survey sampling and the optimum combinations of selected order statistics from various well known parametric distributions, in order to draw inference on population parameters.<ref>Google Scholar</ref><ref>Jagers and Sinha, 2015</ref>\n\nKulldorff was president of the [[:sv:Svenska statistikfrämjandet|Swedish Statistical Society]] 1968-69 and 1985–87, and a member of the [[Statistics Sweden]] Scientific Advisory Board from 1988 to 2002. He was president of the Swedish professors union 1978-1980.<ref name=\"Svensk Biografisk Handbok\"/><ref name=\"Kulldorff2015\">M Kulldorff, 2015-07-08</ref>\n\n===International Statistical Work===\nA large portion of Kulldorff's work was devoted to the promotion of statistics at the international level. He was a guest researcher at [[Texas A&M University]] (1970), [[Purdue University]] (1971), [[Stanford University]] (1971), the [[University of Kentucky]] (1977), the [[University of Arizona]] (1983) and the [[University of Manitoba]] (1985).<ref name=\"Svensk Biografisk Handbok\"/>\nElected to the [[International Statistical Institute]] in 1968, Kulldorff served as vice president of the organization 1981-1985, president elect 1987-1989 and president 1989-1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://isi.cbs.nl/iamamember/Books/Members_of_the_ISI_1885-2002.pdf|title=Members of the International Statistical Institute,\nA cumulative list for the period 1885-2002|author=Gerrit J.

The Autobiography of a Nigerian Village Boy, 2005, p.392</ref>\n\nIn 1991, just after their independence, Kulldorff visited the Baltic countries. Seeing a need for knowledge and education about survey statistics, which had been underdeveloped during the Soviet era, he initiated a scientific exchange program between the Baltic and Nordic countries. A few years later, this led to the creation of the Baltic-Nordic-Ukrainian Network on Survey Statistics, with annual conferences, workshops and/or summer schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/BNU/Events|title=Baltic-Nordic-Ukrainian Network on Survey Statistics|accessdate=2015-10-23}}</ref> In 2006, he received an honorary doctorate from [[Vilnius University]] in [[Lithuania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vu.lt/en/about-us/honorary-doctors|title= Honorary Doctors|author=Vilnius University|accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\n=== YMCA Activities ===\nFrom an early age, Kulldorff was an active scout and scout leader in [[:sv:Malmö KFUM|Malmö YMCA]], leading to a long commitment to the organization. He was a board member (1954–66) and vice president (1962–66) of [[YWCA-YMCA of Sweden|YMCA Sweden]], where he played a key role in joining YMCA and YWCA into one organization, [[YWCA-YMCA of Sweden]]. From 1957-1966, he was a member of the [[YMCA]] International Board, and in the 1970s he was president of the local YMCA chapter in [[Umeå]].<ref name=\"Kulldorff2015\">M Kulldorff, 2015-07-08</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal \n|title=Gunnar Kulldorff\n|journal=Nationalencyklopedin \n|date=2015 \n|first=Gunnar \n|last=Blom \n|id= \n|format= \n|url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/gunnar-kulldorff\n}}\n*{{cite journal \n|title=Obituary: Gunnar Kulldorff\n|journal=Institute of Mathematical Statistics Bulletin \n|date=2015 \n|first=Peter \n|last=Jagers \n|author2 = Bimal Sinha\n|volume=44 \n|issue=6 \n|pages=11 \n|id= \n|format= \n|url=http://bulletin.imstat.org/wp-content/uploads/Bulletin44_6.pdf\n|doi=}}\n* {{citation \n| last = Kulldorff\n| first = Gunnar\n| title = Contributions to the Theory of Estimation from Grouped and Partially Grouped Samples\n| year = 1961\n| publisher = Almqvist & Wiksell / John Wiley & Sons\n}}\n*{{citation\n|title=Gunnar Kulldorff, Umeå\n|last=Kulldorff\n|first=Martin\n|journal=Västerbottens-Kuriren\n|date=2015-07-08\n|id= \n|url=http://www.vk.se/1485321/gunnar-kulldorff-umea-2\n}}\n*{{citation \n|title=Kulldorff, Gunnar\n|last=Svensk Biografisk Handbok \n|date=1993 \n|page=607\n|id= \n|url=http://runeberg.org/vemardet/1993/0607.html\n|publisher=Norstedts Förlag \n}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathGenealogy|id=82430}}\n*{{GoogleScholar|id=KSpvj1YAAAAJ}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Kulldorff, Gunnar\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Swedish statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1927-12-06\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 2015-06-25\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Umeå]], [[Sweden]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kulldorff, Gunnar}}\n[[Category:Survey methodologists]]\n[[Category:Swedish statisticians]]\n[[Category:Swedish scholars and academics]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the International Statistical Institute]]\n[[Category:Elected Members of the International Statistical Institute]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]\n[[Category:Umeå University faculty]]\n[[Category:Lund University alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Umeå]]\n[[Category:People from Malmö]]\n[[Category:YMCA leaders]]\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:2015 deaths]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Gunnar Kulldorff"}}}}
