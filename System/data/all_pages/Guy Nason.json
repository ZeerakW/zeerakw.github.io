He served as a Council member of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] (2004–08) and is a member of the [[EPSRC]] Strategic Advisory Team for Mathematics. He was an [[EPSRC]] Advanced Research Fellow during 2000–5. He took over the post as head of mathematics at Bristol from [[Stephen Wiggins]] in 2008.\n\nHe has served as the Secretary of the RSS Research Section (2002–04), associate editor for the Journal of the RSS, Series B, Computational Statistics and Statistica Sinica and is currently an associate editor for ''[[Biometrika]]''.<ref>[http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/biomet/editorial_board.html Editorial Board],  ''[[Biometrika]]''. Accessed 5 September 2011 </ref>\n\n==Research==\nNason is best known for his work in the area of [[time series analysis]], especially [[wavelet]] approaches.<ref>G. P.

P. Nason ''Wavelet Methods in Statistics with R (Use R)'', Springer-Verlag, ISBN 0-387-75960-3</ref>\n\n==Book==\nNason's book ''Wavelet Methods in Statistics with R'' (Springer, 2008, ISBN 978-0-387-75960-9) describes methods of performing statistical analysis with wavelets using the [[R (programming language)|R]] software environment for statistical computing and the author's WaveThresh package for wavelet analysis within R. The book's topics include [[Shrinkage (statistics)|shrinkage]], [[smoothing]] and [[density estimation]], [[multiresolution analysis]] and [[time series analysis]], and [[Variance-stabilizing transformation|variance stabilization]]. R code interspersed throughout the text allows readers to try out the methods it describes, and to apply these methods to their own data.<ref>Review by Efstathios Paparoditis (2009), ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'', Series A (Statistics in Society) '''173''' (1): 273, {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-985X.2009.00624_7.x}}.</ref><ref>Review by C.
