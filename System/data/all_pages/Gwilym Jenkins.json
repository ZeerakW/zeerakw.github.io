After graduating, he married Margaret Bellingham and together they raised three children. His first job after university was junior fellow at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]]. He followed this by a series of visiting lecturer and professor positions at [[Imperial College London]], [[Stanford University]], [[Princeton University]], and the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], before settling in as a professor of [[Systems Engineering]] at [[Lancaster University]] in 1965. His initial work concerned discrete time domain models for [[Chemical Engineering]] applications.\n\nWhile at Lancaster, he founded and became managing director of ISCOL (International Systems Corporation of Lancaster). He remained in academia until 1974, when he left to start his own consulting company.\n\nHe served on the Research Section Committee and Council of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in the 1960s, founded the ''[[Journal of Systems Engineering]]'' in 1969, and briefly carried out public duties with the Royal Treasury in the mid-1970s. He was elected to the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]] and the [[Institute of Statisticians]].\n\nHe was a jazz and blues enthusiast and an accomplished pianist.\n\nHe succumbed to [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] in 1982.\n\n==Books by G.
