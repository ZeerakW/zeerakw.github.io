Dunn''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] (1896–1975) was the leading figure in establishing a national [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]] system in the United States and is known as the \"father of the [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] movement\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[New Paris, Ohio]], he attended the [[University of Minnesota]] where he earned his M.D. in 1922 and his Ph.D. in 1923. He served as an assistant in medicine at [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital|Presbyterian Hospital]] of [[New York City]] 1923-1924 and as fellow in medicine at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]] (1924–1925).\n\n==Work in statistics==\nIn 1929, he was the first [[biostatistics|biostatistician]] hired by the [[Mayo Clinic]] and established its computer coding system for deriving [[medical statistics]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He was Chief of the National Office of Vital Statistics from 1935 through 1960, first as part of the [[United States Census Bureau|Bureau of the Census]] and later under the [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]], where it eventually became the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] in 1960. In his final year with the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] he was Assistant Surgeon General for aging.\n\nHe was one of the founders of the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS) and of the Inter-American Statistics Institute (IASI).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He was Secretary General of the IASI from 1941 to 1952. The [[Halbert L. Dunn Award]], named in his honor, has been presented since 1981 by NAPHSIS in recognition of outstanding and lasting contributions to the field of [[vital statistics (government records)|vital and health statistics]].\n\n==Wellness==\nDr. Dunn introduced the concept of wellness (or [[high-level wellness]]) in a series of twenty-nine lectures he gave at the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Church in [[Arlington County, Virginia]] in the late 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Those lectures provided the basis for his book, ''High Level Wellness'', which was published in 1961. The book was reissued in a number of editions but did not have a great deal of immediate impact. It did, however, come into the hands of a number of the future leaders of wellness and [[holistic health]] movement that bloomed more than a decade later, such as [[Don B. Ardell]], [[Robert Russell (health educator)|Robert Russell]], [[John Travis (physician)|John Travis]], and [[Elizabeth Neilson]].\n\nFour events in the mid-1970s broadened the impact of Dunn's ideas. First, [[John Travis (physician)|John Travis]] opened the first US wellness center  (Mill Valley, CA, 1975). This center and other organizations were then described in Don Ardell's 1976 book, using Dunn's title (giving Dunn due credit for his origination of the title and concept). Then Elizabeth Neilson founded the journal ''Health Values: Achieving High Level Wellness'' (renamed the ''American Journal of Health Promotion'' in 1996), which was dedicated to Dunn and reprinted one of his papers in its first edition. Lastly, the publisher of ''Health Values'', Charles B. Slack, Inc., published a reprint edition of Dunn's ''High Level Wellness'' that achieved a wider distribution and impact.\n\n==References==\n\n{{No footnotes|date=March 2009}}\n* Ardell, D. B.
