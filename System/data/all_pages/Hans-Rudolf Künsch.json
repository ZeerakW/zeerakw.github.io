As of 2007, Künsch is the Chair of ETH Zürich's Department of Mathematics. He was a co-editor of the leading journal [[Annals of Statistics]] during the 1998–2000 period and has served on the Council of the worldwide organisation Institute of Mathematical Statistics.\n\nKünsch worked as a research student at the University of Tokyo with a scholarship grant from the Japanese government. After completing his PhD at ETH Zürich, with a dissertation project on ''Reellwertige Zufallsfelder auf einem Gitter: Interpolationsprobleme, Variationsprinzip und statistische Analyse'', he returned to research work in Japan, at the University of Tokyo and the Institute of Statistical Mathematics. Since 1983 he has held various academic positions with his Alma Mater ETH Zürich.\n\nProfessor Künsch's main research areas are [[spatial statistics]] and [[random field]]s (geostatistics, parameter estimation for Gibbs fields, [[image analysis]], space-time models); [[time series]] analysis ([[long range dependency|long range dependence]], [[bootstrap|bootstrap methods]] for dependent data, general state-space models); and [[robust statistics]] and [[model selection|statistical model selection]]. Among his most frequently cited contributions is the Annals of Statistics 1989 article on bootstrapping and jackknifing in stationary time series.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/~kuensch/ Künsch's home page]\n* [http://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/ Seminar für Statistik with the ETH]\n* [http://www.math.ethz.ch/ Department of Mathematics at the ETH]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Kunsch, Hans Rudolf\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Swiss mathematician and statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 17 October 1951\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kunsch, Hans Rudolf}}\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Swiss mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Swiss statisticians]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:ETH Zurich faculty]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Hans-Rudolf Künsch"}}}}
