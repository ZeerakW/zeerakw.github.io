He is universally known for his work in originating [[acceptance sampling]] plans for putting inspection operations on a scientific basis in terms of controllable risks.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1958 worked at quality assurance department at [[Bell Laboratories]] with [[Walter Shewhart]], [[George D. Edwards|George Edwards]], [[Harry Romig]], [[R. L. Jones]], [[Paul Olmstead]], [[E.G.D. Paterson]], and [[Mary N. Torrey]]. At that time the basic concepts of acceptance sampling was developed, such as :\n*[[Consumer's Risk]], \n*[[Producer's Risk]], \n*double sampling, \n*lot tolerance percent defective (LTPD), and \n*average outgoing quality limit (AOQL). \n\nAlso he originated several types of:\n*acceptance sampling schemes, \n*CSP type continuous sampling plans, \n*chain sampling plans, and \n*skip-lot sampling plans. \n\nDuring [[World War II]], Dodge served as a consultant to the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], and was [[chairman]] of the [[American Standards Association]] (now the [[American National Standards Institute]]) [[War Committee Z1]], which prepared the [[Z1.1]], [[Z1.2]], and [[Zl.3]] [[quality control standard]]s.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{No footnotes|date=March 2010}}\n*http://www.asq.org/about-asq/who-we-are/bio_dodge.html\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dodge-Romig tables]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Dodge, Harold F.\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = January 23, 1893\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = December 10, 1976\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dodge, Harold F.}}\n[[Category:Quality experts]]\n[[Category:1893 births]]\n[[Category:1976 deaths]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:Winners of the Shewhart Medal]]\n[[Category:Winners of the Wilks Memorial Award]]\n\n\n{{US-statistician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Harold F.
