(2008). The concise encyclopedia of statistics, Springer]</ref>\n\nHe was Associate Professor of Mathematics at [[Stanford University]] from 1927 until 1931, a member of the faculty of [[Columbia University]] from 1931 until 1946, and a Professor of Mathematical Statistics at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] from 1946 until his death. A street in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] bears his name. In 1972 he received the [[North Carolina Award]] for contributions to science.\n\n==Statistics==\nHotelling is known to statisticians because of [[Hotelling's T-squared distribution]] which is a generalization of the [[Student's t-distribution]] in multivariate setting, and its use in statistical [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] and confidence regions. He also introduced [[canonical correlation]] analysis.\n\nAt the beginning of his statistical career Hotelling came under the influence of [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]], whose ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]'' had \"revolutionary importance\", according to Hotelling's review. Hotelling was able to maintain professional relations with Fisher, despite the latter's temper tantrums and polemics. Hotelling suggested that Fisher use the English word \"[[cumulant]]s\" for the [[T. N. Thiele|Thiele]]'s Danish \"semi-invariants\". Fisher's emphasis on the sampling distribution of a statistic was extended by [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]] with greater precision and wider applications, which Hotelling recognized. Hotelling sponsored refugees from European anti-semitism and Nazism, welcoming [[Henry Mann]] and [[Abraham Wald]] to his research group at Columbia. While at Hotelling's group, Wald developed [[sequential analysis]] and [[statistical decision theory]], which Hotelling described as \"pragmatism in action\".\n\nIn the United States, Harold Hotelling is known for his leadership of the statistics profession, in particular for his vision of a statistics department at a university, which convinced many universities to start statistics departments. Hotelling was known for his leadership of departments at [[Columbia University]] and the [[University of North Carolina]].\n\n==Economics==\nHotelling has a crucial place in the growth of mathematical economics; several areas of active research were influenced by his economics papers. While at the [[University of Washington]], he was encouraged to switch from pure mathematics toward mathematical economics by the famous mathematician [[Eric Temple Bell]]. Later, at [[Columbia University]] (where during 1933-34 he taught [[Milton Friedman]] statistics) in the '40s, Hotelling in turn encouraged young [[Kenneth Arrow]] to switch from mathematics and statistics applied to actuarial studies towards more general applications of mathematics in general economic theory. Hotelling is the [[eponym]] of [[Hotelling's law]], [[Hotelling's lemma]], and [[Hotelling's rule]] in [[economics]].\n\n===Spatial economics===\n\nOne of Hotelling’s most important contributions to economics was his conception of “[[spatial economics]]” in his 1929 article.<ref>Hotelling, Harold (1929). Stability in Competition. Economic Journal 39(153):41-57</ref>  Space was not just a barrier to moving goods around, but rather a field upon which competitors jostled to be nearest to their customers.<ref>Palda, Filip (2013). The Apprentice Economist: Seven Steps to Mastery. Toronto. Cooper-Wolfling Press.</ref>\n\nHotteling considers a situation in which there are two sellers at point A and B in a [[line segment]] of size l. The buyers are [[uniform distribution (continuous)|distributed uniformly]] in this line segment and carry the merchandise to their home at cost c. Let p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub> be the prices charged by A and B, and let the line segment be divided in 3 parts of size a, x+y and b, where x+y is the size of the segment between A and B, a the portion of segment to the left of A and b the portion of segment to the right of B. Therefore a+x+y+b=l. Since the product being sold is a [[commodity]], the point of indifference to buying is given by p<sub>1</sub>+cx=p<sub>2</sub>+cy. Solving for x and y yields:\n\n<math>x=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( l-a-b+\\frac{p_{2}-p_{1}}{c} \\right)</math>\n\n<math>y=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( l-a-b+\\frac{p_{1}-p_{2}}{c} \\right)</math>\n\nLet q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub> indicate the quantities sold by A and B. The sellers profit are:\n\n<math>\\pi_{1}=p_{1}q_{1}=p_{1}\\left( a+x \\right)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( l+a-b \\right)p_{1}-\\frac{p_{1}^{2}}{2c}+\\frac{p_{1}p_{2}}{2c}</math>\n\n<math>\\pi_{2}=p_{2}q_{2}=p_{2}\\left( b+y \\right)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( l-a+b \\right)p_{2}-\\frac{p_{2}^{2}}{2c}+\\frac{p_{1}p_{2}}{2c}</math>\n\nBy imposing profit maximization:\n\n<math>\\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial p_{1}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( l+a-b \\right)-\\frac{p_{1}}{c}+\\frac{p_{2}}{2c}=0</math>\n\n<math>\\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial p_{2}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( l+a-b \\right)-\\frac{p_{1}}{2c}+\\frac{p_{2}}{c}=0</math>\n\nHotteling obtains the [[economic equilibrium]]. Hotteling argues this equilibrium is [[Lyapunov stability|stable]] even though the sellers may try to establish a price [[cartel]].\n\n===Non-convexities===\nHotelling made pioneering studies of [[non-convexity in economics]].\nIn [[economics]], ''non-convexity'' refers to violations of the [[convexity in economics|convexity assumptions of elementary economics]]. Basic economics textbooks concentrate on consumers with [[convex preferences]] and convex [[budget set]]s and on producers with convex [[production set]]s; for convex models, the predicted economic behavior is well understood.<ref name=\"MCNC\"/><ref name=\"GreenHeller\" >{{cite book|first1=Jerry|last1=Green|first2=Walter&nbsp;P.|last2=Heller|chapter=1 Mathematical&nbsp;analysis and&nbsp;convexity with applications to economics|pages=15–52|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B7P5Y-4FDF0FN-5/2/613440787037f7f62d65a05172503737|doi=10.1016/S1573-4382(81)01005-9|title=Handbook of mathematical&nbsp;economics, Volume&nbsp;'''I'''|editor1-link=Kenneth Arrow |editor1-first=Kenneth&nbsp;Joseph|editor1-last=Arrow|editor2-first=Michael&nbsp;D<!-- . -->|editor2-last=Intriligator|series=Handbooks in economics|volume=1|publisher=North-Holland Publishing&nbsp;Co.|location=Amsterdam|year=1981|isbn=0-444-86126-2|mr=634800|ref=harv}}</ref>  When convexity assumptions are violated, then many of the good properties of competitive markets need not hold: Thus, non-convexity is associated with [[market failure]]s,<ref name=\"MarketFailure\"/><ref name=\"SalanieDefinition\" >{{harvtxt|Salanié|2000|p=36|}}</ref> where [[supply and demand]] differ or where [[market equilibrium|market equilibria]] can be [[Pareto efficiency|inefficient]].<ref name=\"MCNC\"/><ref name=\"SalanieDefinition\"/><ref name=\"Laffont\"/><ref name=\"Starrett\"/><ref name=\"Baumol\"/><ref name=\"GuesnerieNonConvex\"/>\n\n====Producers with increasing returns to scale: Marginal cost pricing====\nIn \"[[oligopoly|oligopolies]]\" (markets dominated by a few producers<!-- with increasing [[returns to&nbsp;scale]] -->), especially in \"[[monopoly|monopolies]]\" (markets dominated by one&nbsp;producer), non-convexities remain important.<ref name=\"GuesnerieNonConvex\" ><!-- Guenserie discusses public economies a bit later, but he introduces \"indivisibilities\" on page 1, and economists would recognize that this synopsis is faithful and accessible to the public, imho -->Page 1: {{cite news|last=Guesnerie|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Guesnerie|title=Pareto optimality in non-convex economies|journal=Econometrica|volume=43|year=1975|pages=1–29|jstor=1913410|doi=10.2307/1913410|mr=443877|ref=harv}} ({{cite news|<!-- last=Guesnerie|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Guesnerie -->|title=Errata<!-- : \"Pareto optimality in non-convex economies\" (''Econometrica'' 43 (1975), 1–29) -->|journal=Econometrica |volume=43|year=1975|number=5–6|page=1010|doi=10.2307/1911353|mr=443878 | jstor = 1911353}})</ref> Concerns with large producers exploiting market power initiated the literature on non-convex sets, when [[Piero Sraffa]] wrote about firms with increasing [[returns to scale]] in&nbsp;1926,<ref>{{cite news|last=Sraffa|first=Piero|authorlink=Piero Sraffa|year=1926|title=The Laws of returns under competitive conditions|journal=Economic Journal|volume=36|number=144|pages=535–550|jstor=2959866|ref=harv}}</ref> after which Hotelling wrote about [[marginal&nbsp;cost pricing]] in&nbsp;1938.<ref>{{cite news|\nfirst=Harold|last=Hotelling|<!-- authorlink=Harold Hotelling -->|title=The General welfare in relation to problems of taxation and of railway and utility rates|title=Econometrica|volume=6|number=3|date=July 1938|pages=242–269|jstor=1907054}}</ref> Both Sraffa and Hotelling illuminated the [[market power]] of producers without competitors, clearly stimulating a literature on the supply-side of the economy.<ref>Pages 5–7: {{cite book|last=Quinzii|first=Martine|title=Increasing returns and efficiency|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|edition=Revised translation of (1988) ''Rendements croissants et efficacité economique''.

They can be detected only by the discontinuities that may occur in demand with variation in price-ratios, leading to an abrupt jumping of a point of tangency across a chasm when the straight line is rotated. But, while such discontinuities may reveal the existence of chasms, they can never measure their depth. The concave portions of the indifference curves and their many-dimensional generalizations, if they exist, must forever remain in\nunmeasurable obscurity.<ref>\n{{harvtxt|Hotelling|1935|p=74}}:\n{{cite news|first=Harold|last=Hotelling|<!-- authorlink=Harold Hotelling -->\n|title=Demand functions with limited budgets|journal=Econometrica|volume=3|number=1|date=January 1935|pages=66–78|jstor=1907346}}\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\naccording to&nbsp;Diewert.<ref name=\"Diewert\" >{{harvtxt|Diewert|1982|pp=552–553}}: {{cite book|first=W.&nbsp;E.|last=Diewert|chapter=12 Duality approaches to microeconomic theory\n|pages=535–599\n|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B7P5Y-4FDF0FN-R/2/dcc0f8c9352eb054c96b3ff481976ce7\n|doi=10.1016/S1573-4382(82)02007-4\n|title=Handbook of mathematical&nbsp;economics, Volume&nbsp;'''II'''|editor1-link=Kenneth Arrow |editor1-first=Kenneth&nbsp;Joseph|editor1-last=Arrow|editor2-first=Michael&nbsp;D<!-- . -->|editor2-last=Intriligator|series=Handbooks in economics|volume=1|publisher=North-Holland Publishing&nbsp;Co.|location=Amsterdam|year=1982|isbn=978-0-444-86127-6|mr=648778|ref=harv}}\n</ref>\n\nFollowing Hotelling's pioneering research on non-convexities in economics, research in economics has recognized non-convexity in new areas of economics.
