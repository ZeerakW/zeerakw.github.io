At the [[University of Cambridge]] he taught mathematics, then [[geophysics]] and finally became the [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy]].\n\nHe married another mathematician and physicist, [[Bertha Swirles]] (1903–1999), in 1940 and together they wrote ''Methods of Mathematical Physics''.\n\nOne of his major contributions was on the [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] approach to [[probability]] (also see [[Jeffreys prior]]), as well as the idea that the Earth's [[planetary core]] was liquid.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bolt | first1 = B.

Although the Schrödinger equation was developed two years later, Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin were apparently unaware of this earlier work, so Jeffreys is often neglected when credit is given for the [[WKB approximation]].<ref name=\"Andrianov_2004\">{{cite book | author = Igorʹ Vasilʹevich Andrianov, Jan Awrejcewicz, L.

In 1948, Jeffreys received the Prix Charles Lagrange from the [[Academie royale de Belgique|Académie royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique]].<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/vetlesen/recipients/1962/jeffreys_bio.html</ref>\n\nFrom 1939 to 1952 he was established as Director of the International Seismological Summary further known as [[International Seismological Centre]].\n\nThe textbook ''Probability Theory: The Logic of Science,'' written by the physicist and probability theorist [[Edwin T. Jaynes]], is dedicated to Jeffreys. The dedication reads, \"Dedicated to the memory of Sir Harold Jeffreys, who saw the truth and preserved it.\"\n\nIt is only through an appendix to the third edition of Jeffreys' book ''Scientific Inference'' that we know about [[Mary Cartwright]]'s [[Proof that pi is irrational#Cartwright.27s proof|method of proving that the number {{pi}}]] is [[irrational number|irrational]].\n\n==Opposition to continental drift==\nJeffreys was a strong opponent of [[continental drift]]. For him, continental drift was \"out of the question\" because no force even remotely strong enough to move the continents across the Earth's surface was evident.<ref name=CLewis2002>{{cite book |author=Lewis, Cherry |title=The dating game: one man's search for the age of the Earth |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |date=2002 |pages=159 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=d2AZZ3NXuogC&printsec=frontcover#PPA159,M1 |isbn=0-521-89312-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* Fellow, Royal Society, 1925<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n* Adams Prize, 1927 (Constitution of the Earth)\n* Gold Medal, Royal Astronomical Society, 1937\n* Buchan Prize, Royal Meteorological Society, 1929\n* [[Murchison Medal]] of Geological Society (Great Britain) 1939\n* Victoria Medal, Royal Geographical Society, 1941\n* Lagrange Prize, Brussels Academy, 1948\n* Royal Medal, 1948\n* [[William Bowie Medal]], American Geophysical Union, 1952\n* Knighted, 1953\n* Copley Medal, Royal Society, 1961\n* [[Vetlesen Prize]], 1962\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''The Earth, Its Origin, History and Physical Constitution'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1924; 5th edn. 1970; 6th edn. 1976\n* ''Operational Methods in Mathematical Physics'', Cambridge University Press, 1927<ref>{{cite journal|author=Uhler, Horace Scudder|title=Review: ''Operational methods in mathematical physics'', by H.
