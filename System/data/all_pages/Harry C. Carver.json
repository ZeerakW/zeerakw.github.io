He was a major influence in the development of [[mathematical statistics]] as an academic discipline.\n\nBorn in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]], Carver was educated at the University of Michigan, earning his B.S. degree in 1915, and the next year becoming an instructor in mathematics; he taught statistics in [[actuarial science|actuarial]] applications. At the time, the University of Michigan was only the second such institution in the United States to offer this type of course, after the pioneering [[Iowa State University]]. Carver was appointed assistant professor at Michigan in 1918, then associate professor (1921) and full professor (1936); during this period the University's program in mathematical statistics and [[probability]] underwent significant expansion.\n\nIn 1930 Carver founded the journal ''Annals of Mathematical Statistics'', which over time became an important periodical in the field. Financial support, however, was lacking in the midst of the [[Great Depression]]; in January 1934 Carver undertook financial responsibility for the Annals and maintained the existence of the journal at his own expense. In 1935 he helped to start the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]], which in 1938 assumed control over the journal; [[Samuel S. Wilks]] succeeded Carver as editor in the same year. The Institute has named its Harry C. Carver Medal after him.\n\nWith the coming of [[World War II]], Carver devoted his energies to solving problems in [[aerial navigation]], an interest he maintained for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn one lecture titled \"Let Us Own Data Science\" given by [[Bin Yu]] in 2014 at [[Peking University]], Carver was described as in the following formula: Turner<ref>[http://www.aaabg.org/aaabghome/HNTbiography.php Helen Newton Turner], [http://www.aaabg.org/aaabghome/ AAABG], accessed 2014-09-02.</ref> + Carver = \"Data Scientist\".<ref>[http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~wahba/binyu.on.datascience.pdf Let Us Own Data Science], retrieved 2014-09-02.</ref><ref>[http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNzY1MTk2OTY0.html Let Us Own Data Science], [[Youku]], retrieved 2014-09-02.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Craig, Cecil C. \"Harry C.
