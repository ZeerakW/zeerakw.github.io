He received his Ph.D. in 1956 at [[Cornell University]] under supervision of [[Mark Kac]].  He was an instructor at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Hebrew University]] before returning to Cornell where he is now professor [[emeritus]] of mathematics.\n\n== Mathematical work ==\nKesten's work includes a number of fundamental contributions, including the following.\n* Showing that amenability is equivalent to zero spectral gap and that a regular tree of degree <math>d</math> has spectral radius <math>2\\sqrt{d-1}</math><ref>Harry Kesten, Symmetric random walks on groups.
