After a postdoctoral position at [[Stanford University]], he taught at [[Utrecht University]].\n\nSince 1986, Barendregt has taught at [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], where he now holds the Chair of Foundations of Mathematics and Computer Science. His research group works on Constructive Interactive Mathematics. He is also Adjunct Professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], Pittsburgh, USA. He has been a visiting scholar at Darmstadt, [[ETH ZÃ¼rich]], Siena, and Kyoto.\n\nIn 1997 Barendregt was elected member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/nl/leden/leden/3833 |title=Henk Barendregt |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref> On 6 February 2003 Barendregt was awarded the [[Spinozapremie]] for 2002, the highest scientific award in the Netherlands.
