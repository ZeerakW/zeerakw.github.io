He attended the [[Lycée]] in [[Marseilles]] as a young child, and then the [[Lycée]] in [[Strasbourg]]. After graduating from the Lycée he entered the [[Academy]] in [[Strasbourg]] where he was prepared for the examination for entrance to the prestigious [[École Polytechnique]] in [[Paris]], to which he was accepted in 1865.<ref name=\"mainbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Printonly/Brocard.html|title=Pierre René Jean Baptiste Henri Brocard|first1=J.

He acted as a [[meteorologist]] in the [[French navy]], and general technician as well.\n\nBrocard soon saw active service, as [[Napoleon III]] declared [[war]] upon [[Prussia]]. Brocard was one of the 120,000 men under [[Marshal MacMahon]] led to [[Metz]] to free the [[French army]] of the [[Rhine river|Rhine]]. The French army, however, was defeated on 31 August at the [[Battle of Sedan]], and was taken prisoner along with approximately 83,000 other combatants.<ref name=\"mainbio\"/>\n\n===Middle years===\nAfter Brocard was freed, he returned to his military position and continued teaching, publishing his mathematical articles in the most popular mathematical journal of that time, {{lang|fr|''Nouvelles Correspondances Mathématiques''}} (also called ''Nouvelles annales mathématiques'').<ref>{{cite web|id={{hdl|2027/mdp.39015065163720}}|title=''Notes de bibliographie des courbes géométriques'' T. 1|first=Henri|last=Brocard|publisher=Comte-Jacquet|location=Bar Le Duc|year=1897}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/ABQ9972|title=''Notes de bibliographie des courbes géométriques'' T. 2|first=Henri|last=Brocard|year=1899}}</ref> He joined the [[Société Mathématique de France]] in 1873, just a year after its founding. In 1875 he was inducted into the French Association for the Advancement of Science as well as the French Meteorological Society. He was shortly after sent to northern [[Africa]], where he served as a military technician for the French forces stationed in [[Algiers]], the seat of French Africa.

He served with the Meteorological Commission in [[Montpellier]] before moving to [[Grenoble]] and lastly [[Bar-le-duc]]. He honorably retired from the French military in 1910 as a [[lieutenant colonel]].

He was offered the presidency of Bar-le-Duc's ''Letters, Sciences, and Arts Society'', of which he had been a longtime member and correspondent for several foreign academies of, but declined. He died on 16 January 1922 while on a trip to [[Kensington]], [[London]], [[England]].<ref name=\"mainbio\"/>\n\n==Contributions==\n\n===Brocard triangle, Brocard circle, and Brocard points===\n[[Image:Brocard point.svg|thumb|left|A diagram of the [[Brocard point]].]]\n{{main|Brocard points|Brocard circle|Brocard triangle}}\nBrocard's most well-known contributions to mathematics are the [[Brocard point]]s, the [[Brocard circle]], and the [[Brocard triangle]]. The positive Brocard point (sometimes known as the first Brocard point) of a [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] plane [[triangle]] is the interior [[Point (geometry)|point]] of the triangle for which the three angles formed by two of the vertices and the point are equal. Their common value is the Brocard angle of the triangle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Math Trek - Brocard points|url=http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_7_16_01.html}}</ref> The Brocard circle of the triangle is a [[circle]] having a [[diameter]] of the [[line segment]] between the [[circumcenter]] and [[symmedian]]. It contains the [[Brocard points]].<ref>{{mathworld|urlname=BrocardCircle|title=Brocard Circle}}</ref> The Brocard triangle of a [[triangle]] is a triangle formed by the [[Line-line intersection|intersection]] of [[Line (geometry)|line]] from a vertex to its corresponding [[Brocard point]] and a line from another vertex to its corresponding Brocard point and the other two points constructed using different combinations of vertices and Brocard points. The Brocard triangle is inscribed in the [[Brocard circle]].<ref>{{mathworld|urlname=FirstBrocardTriangle|title=First Brocard Triangle}}</ref>\n\n===Other mathematical contributions===\nBrocard published various other papers on [[mathematics]] during his time at [[Bar-le-duc]], none of which became as well known as ''Etudes d'un nouveau cercle du plan du triangle''. He also conjured up a famous unsolved problem thought to have no answers other than the three he provided. This problem is called [[Brocard's problem|Brocard's Problem]]. One other achievement of his is guessing at the meaning of the cryptic title of one of [[Girard Desargues]]' papers, ''DALG''. In his paper ''Analyse d'autographes et autres écrits de Girard Desargues'', he surmised that it stood for ''Des Argues, Lyonnais, Géometre'', which is the generally accepted title.<ref>{{cite web|title=Récréations Mathématiques (1624): A Study on its Authorship, Sources and Influence 2004|url=http://logica.rug.ac.be/albrecht/thesis/Etten-intro.pdf|first=Alfred|last=Heefer}}</ref>\n\n===Meteorology===\n[[Image:Algieruniversity.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Algiers]] administrates the Meteorological Society which Brocard founded. ]]\nThough Brocard made no major notable original discoveries in [[meteorology]], he founded the Meteorological Institute in [[Algiers]] and served as a meteorological technician during his time in the French military.
