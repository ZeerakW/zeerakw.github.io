In his research on the [[three-body problem]], Poincaré became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern [[chaos theory]]. He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of [[topology]].\n\nPoincaré made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the [[Lorentz transformations]] in their modern symmetrical form. Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1853–1928) in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of [[Maxwell's equations]], an important step in the formulation of the theory of [[special relativity]].\n\nThe [[Poincaré group]] used in physics and mathematics was named after him.\n\n==Life==\nPoincaré was born on 29 April 1854 in Cité Ducale neighborhood, [[Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle]] into an influential family.<ref>Belliver, 1956</ref> His father Leon Poincaré (1828–1892) was a professor of medicine at the [[University of Nancy]].<ref>Sagaret, 1911</ref> His adored younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher [[Emile Boutroux]]. Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, [[Raymond Poincaré]], who would become the President of France, 1913 to 1920, and a fellow member of the [[Académie française]].<ref name=\"IEP\">[http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/p/poincare.htm The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Jules Henri Poincaré article by Mauro Murzi&nbsp;– Retrieved November 2006.</ref> He was raised in the Roman Catholic faith.\n\n===Education===\n[[File:Henri Poincaré maison natale Nancy plaque.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Plaque on the birthplace of Henri Poincaré at house number 117 on the Grande Rue in the city of Nancy.]]\n\nDuring his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with [[diphtheria]] and received special instruction from his mother, Eugénie Launois (1830–1897).\n\nIn 1862, Henri entered the Lycée in [[Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Nancy]] (now renamed the Lycée Henri Poincaré in his honour, along with the University of Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lycée and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a \"monster of mathematics\" and he won first prizes in the [[concours général]], a competition between the top pupils from all the Lycées across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as \"average at best\".<ref>O'Connor et al., 2002</ref> However, poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties.<ref>Carl, 1968</ref> He graduated from the Lycée in 1871 with a bachelor's degree in letters and sciences.\n\nDuring the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, he served alongside his father in the Ambulance Corps.\n\nPoincaré entered the [[École Polytechnique]] in 1873 and graduated in 1875. There he studied mathematics as a student of [[Charles Hermite]], continuing to excel and publishing his first paper (''Démonstration nouvelle des propriétés de l'indicatrice d'une surface'') in 1874. From November 1875 to June 1878 he studied at the [[École des Mines]], while continuing the study of mathematics in addition to the mining engineering syllabus, and received the degree of ordinary mining engineer in March 1879.<ref>F. Verhulst</ref>\n\nAs a graduate of the École des Mines, he joined the [[Corps des Mines]] as an inspector for the [[Vesoul]] region in northeast France. He was on the scene of a mining disaster at [[Magny-lès-Jussey|Magny]] in August 1879 in which 18 miners died. He carried out the official investigation into the accident in a characteristically thorough and humane way.\n\nAt the same time, Poincaré was preparing for his doctorate in sciences in mathematics under the supervision of Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis was in the field of [[differential equations]]. It was named ''Sur les propriétés des fonctions définies par les équations différences''. Poincaré devised a new way of studying the properties of these equations. He not only faced the question of determining the integral of such equations, but also was the first person to study their general geometric properties. He realised that they could be used to model the behaviour of multiple bodies in free motion within the [[solar system]]. Poincaré graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1879.\n\n[[Image:Young Poincare.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The young Henri Poincaré]]\n\n===The first scientific achievements===\nAfter receiving his degree, Poincaré began teaching as junior lecturer in mathematics at the [[Caen University|University of Caen]] in Normandy (in December 1879). At the same time he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of [[automorphic function]]s.\n\nThere, in Caen, he met his future wife, Louise Poulin d'Andesi (Louise Poulain d'Andecy) and on 20 April 1881, they married. Together they had four children: Jeanne (born 1887), Yvonne (born 1889), Henriette (born 1891), and Léon (born 1893).\n\nPoincaré immediately established himself among the greatest mathematicians of Europe, attracting the attention of many prominent mathematicians. In 1881 Poincaré was invited to take a teaching position at the Faculty of Sciences of the [[University of Paris]]; he accepted the invitation. During the years of 1883 to 1897, he taught mathematical analysis in [[École Polytechnique]].\n\nIn 1881–1882, Poincaré created a new branch of mathematics: the qualitative theory of differential equations. He showed how it is possible to derive the most important information about the behavior of a family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in [[celestial mechanics]] and [[mathematical physics]].\n\n===Career===\nHe never fully abandoned his mining career to mathematics. He worked at the Ministry of Public Services as an engineer in charge of northern railway development from 1881 to 1885. He eventually became chief engineer of the Corps de Mines in 1893 and inspector general in 1910.\n\nBeginning in 1881 and for the rest of his career, he taught at the University of Paris (the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]). He was initially appointed as the ''maître de conférences d'analyse'' (associate professor of analysis).<ref>Sageret, 1911</ref> Eventually, he held the chairs of Physical and Experimental Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Theory of Probability, and Celestial Mechanics and Astronomy.\n\nIn 1887, at the young age of 32, Poincaré was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He became its president in 1906, and was elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1909.\n\nIn 1887, he won [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II, King of Sweden]]'s mathematical competition for a resolution of the [[three-body problem]] concerning the free motion of multiple orbiting bodies. (See [[#The three-body problem]] section below)\n\n[[File:Poincaré gravestone.jpg|upright|thumb|The Poincaré family grave at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]\nIn 1893, Poincaré joined the French [[Bureau des Longitudes]], which engaged him in the [[Clock synchronization|synchronisation of time]] around the world. In 1897 Poincaré backed an unsuccessful proposal for the [[Decimal degrees|decimalisation of circular measure]], and hence time and [[longitude]].<ref>see Galison 2003</ref> It was this post which led him to consider the question of establishing international time zones and the synchronisation of time between bodies in relative motion. (See [[#Work on relativity]] section below)\n\nIn 1899, and again more successfully in 1904, he intervened in the trials of [[Alfred Dreyfus]]. He attacked the spurious scientific claims of some of the evidence brought against Dreyfus, who was a Jewish officer in the French army charged with treason by colleagues.\n\nIn 1912, Poincaré underwent surgery for a [[prostate]] problem and subsequently died from an [[embolism]] on 17 July 1912, in Paris. He was 58 years of age. He is buried in the Poincaré family vault in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse|Cemetery of Montparnasse]], Paris.\n\nA former French Minister of Education, [[Claude Allègre]], has recently (2004) proposed that Poincaré be reburied in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] in Paris, which is reserved for French citizens only of the highest honour.<ref>[http://www.lexpress.fr/idees/tribunes/dossier/allegre/dossier.asp?ida=430274 Lorentz, Poincaré et Einstein]</ref>\n\n====Students====\nPoincaré had two notable doctoral students at the University of Paris, [[Louis Bachelier]] (1900) and [[Dimitrie Pompeiu]] (1905).<ref>[http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=34227 Mathematics Genealogy Project] North Dakota State University.

This was known originally as the three-body problem and later the [[n-body problem|''n''-body problem]], where ''n'' is any number of more than two orbiting bodies. The ''n''-body solution was considered very important and challenging at the close of the 19th century. Indeed, in 1887, in honour of his 60th birthday, [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II, King of Sweden]], advised by [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]], established a prize for anyone who could find the solution to the problem. The announcement was quite specific:\n\n<blockquote>Given a system of arbitrarily many mass points that attract each [[inverse-square law|according to Newton's law]], under the assumption that no two points ever collide, try to find a representation of the coordinates of each point as a series in a variable that is some known function of time and for all of whose values the series [[uniform convergence|converges uniformly]].</blockquote>\n\nIn case the problem could not be solved, any other important contribution to classical mechanics would then be considered to be prizeworthy. The prize was finally awarded to Poincaré, even though he did not solve the original problem.\nOne of the judges, the distinguished [[Karl Weierstrass]], said, ''\"This work cannot indeed be considered as furnishing the complete solution of the question proposed, but that it is nevertheless of such importance that its publication will inaugurate a new era in the history of celestial mechanics.\"''\n(The first version of his contribution even contained a serious error; for details see the article by Diacu<ref name=diacu>{{Citation\n| author=Diacu, F. | year=1996 | title=The solution of the ''n''-body Problem | journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer | volume =18  | pages =66–70\n| doi=10.1007/BF03024313\n| issue=3}}</ref>). The version finally printed contained many important ideas which led to the [[chaos theory|theory of chaos]]. The problem as stated originally was finally solved by [[Karl F. Sundman]] for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 in 1912 and was generalised to the case of ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;3 bodies by [[Qiudong Wang]] in the 1990s.\n\n===Work on relativity===\n[[Image:Curie and Poincare 1911 Solvay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marie Curie]] and Poincaré talk at the 1911 [[Solvay Conference]]]]\n{{main|Lorentz ether theory|History of special relativity}}\n\n====Local time====\nPoincaré's work at the Bureau des Longitudes on establishing international time zones led him to consider how clocks at rest on the Earth, which would be moving at different speeds relative to absolute space (or the \"[[luminiferous aether]]\"), could be synchronised. At the same time Dutch theorist [[Hendrik Lorentz]] was developing Maxwell's theory into a theory of the motion of charged particles (\"electrons\" or \"ions\"), and their interaction with radiation.

Thus he interpreted Lorentz's theory and in so doing he came up with many insights that are now associated with special relativity. In [[s:The Measure of Time|The Measure of Time]] (1898), Poincaré said, \"\nA little reflection is sufficient to understand that all these affirmations have by themselves no meaning. They can have one only as the result of a convention.\" He also argued that scientists have to set the constancy of the speed of light as a [[postulate]] to give physical theories the simplest form.<ref>{{Citation\n| author=Poincaré, H. | year=1898 | title=[[s:The Measure of Time|The Measure of Time]] | journal=Revue de métaphysique et de morale | volume =6 | pages =1–13}}</ref>\nBased on these assumptions he discussed in 1900 Lorentz's \"wonderful invention\" of local time and remarked that it arose when moving clocks are synchronised by exchanging light signals assumed to travel with the same speed in both directions in a moving frame.<ref name=action>{{Citation\n| author=Poincaré, H. | year=1900 | title=[[s:fr:La théorie de Lorentz et le principe de réaction|La théorie de Lorentz et le principe de réaction]] | journal=Archives néerlandaises des sciences exactes et naturelles | volume =5  | pages =252–278}}.

In the published version of that he wrote:<ref name=short>{{Citation | author=Poincaré, H. | year=1905 | title=[[s:fr:Sur la dynamique de l'électron (juin)|Sur la dynamique de l'électron]] ([[s:Translation:On the Dynamics of the Electron (June)|On the Dynamics of the Electron]]) | journal=Comptes Rendus | volume =140 | pages =1504–1508}} (Wikisource translation)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The essential point, established by Lorentz, is that the equations of the electromagnetic field are not altered by a certain transformation (which I will call by the name of Lorentz) of the form:\n::<math>x^\\prime = k\\ell\\left(x + \\varepsilon t\\right)\\!,\\;t^\\prime = k\\ell\\left(t + \\varepsilon x\\right)\\!,\\;y^\\prime = \\ell y,\\;z^\\prime = \\ell z,\\;k = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\varepsilon^2}.</math></blockquote>\n\nand showed that the arbitrary function <math>\\ell\\left(\\varepsilon\\right)</math> must be unity for all <math>\\varepsilon</math> (Lorentz had set <math>\\ell = 1</math> by a different argument) to make the transformations form a group. In an enlarged version of the paper that appeared in 1906 Poincaré pointed out that the combination <math>x^2+ y^2+ z^2- c^2t^2</math> is [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]].

While studying the conflict between the [[Newton's laws of motion|action/reaction principle]] and [[Lorentz ether theory]], he tried to determine whether the [[center of gravity]] still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included.<ref name=action /> He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincaré concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious [[fluid]] (\"fluide fictif\") with a mass density of ''E''/''c''<sup>2</sup>. If the [[center of mass frame]] is defined by both the mass of matter ''and'' the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible—it's neither created or destroyed—then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincaré assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincaré said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.\n\nHowever, Poincaré's resolution led to a paradox when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a [[recoil]] from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincaré performed a [[Lorentz boost]] (to order ''v''/''c'') to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow [[perpetual motion]], a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.\n\nPoincaré himself came back to this topic in his St. Louis lecture (1904).<ref name=louis /> This time (and later also in 1908) he rejected<ref>Miller 1981, Secondary sources on relativity</ref> the possibility that energy carries mass and criticized the ether solution to compensate the above-mentioned problems:\n\n{{quote|The apparatus will recoil as if it were a cannon and the projected energy a ball, and that contradicts the principle of Newton, since our present projectile has no mass; it is not matter, it is energy. [..] Shall we say that the space which separates the oscillator from the receiver and which the disturbance must traverse in passing from one to the other, is not empty, but is filled not only with ether, but with air, or even in inter-planetary space with some subtile, yet ponderable fluid; that this matter receives the shock, as does the receiver, at the moment the energy reaches it, and recoils, when the disturbance leaves it? That would save Newton's principle, but it is not true. If the energy during its propagation remained always attached to some material substratum, this matter would carry the light along with it and Fizeau has shown, at least for the air, that there is nothing of the kind. Michelson and Morley have since confirmed this. We might also suppose that the motions of matter proper were exactly compensated by those of the ether; but that would lead us to the same considerations as those made a moment ago. The principle, if thus interpreted, could explain anything, since whatever the visible motions we could imagine hypothetical motions to compensate them. But if it can explain anything, it will allow us to foretell nothing; it will not allow us to choose between the various possible hypotheses, since it explains everything in advance.

Poincaré never acknowledged Einstein's work on [[special relativity]]. However, Einstein expressed sympathy with Poincaré's outlook obliquely in a letter to [[Hans Vaihinger]] on 3 May 1919, when Einstein considered Vaihinger's general outlook to be close to his own and Poincaré's to be close to Vaihinger's.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein |url=http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol9-trans/52 |publisher=Princeton U.P. |accessdate=13 December 2014}}  See also this letter, with commentary, in {{cite journal |last=Sass |first=Hans-Martin |date=1979 |title=Einstein über \"wahre Kultur\" und die Stellung der Geometrie im Wissenschaftssystem:  Ein Brief Albert Einsteins an Hans Vaihinger vom Jahre 1919 |journal=Zeitschrift für allgemeine Wissenschaftstheorie/Journal for General Philosophy of Science |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=316–319 |jstor=25170513 |language=de |doi=10.1007/bf01802352}}</ref> In public, Einstein acknowledged Poincaré posthumously in the text of a lecture in 1921 called ''Geometrie und Erfahrung'' in connection with [[non-Euclidean geometry]], but not in connection with special relativity.

The term \"topology\" was introduced, as suggested by [[Johann Benedict Listing]], instead of previously used \"Analysis situs\". Some important concepts were introduced by [[Enrico Betti]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]]. But the foundation of this science, for a space of any dimension, was created by Poincaré. His first article on this topic appeared in 1894.<ref>D. Stillwell, Mathematics and its history. pages = 419–435</ref>\n\nHis research in geometry led to the abstract topological definition of [[homotopy]] and [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]]. He also first introduced the basic concepts and invariants of combinatorial topology, such as Betti numbers and the fundamental group. Poincaré proved a formula relating the number of edges, vertices and faces of ''n''-dimensional polyhedron (the Euler–Poincaré theorem) and gave the first precise formulation of the intuitive notion of dimension.<ref>PS Aleksandrov, Poincaré and topology. pages = 27–81</ref>\n\n===Astronomy and celestial mechanics===\n[[File:N-body problem (3).gif|frame|left|150px |  <center> Chaotic motion in three-body problem (computer simulation).]]\nPoincaré published two now classical monographs, \"New Methods of Celestial Mechanics\" (1892–1899) and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). They introduced the small parameter method, fixed points, integral invariants, variational equations, the convergence of the asymptotic expansions. Generalizing a theory of Bruns (1887), Poincaré showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area were the first major achievements in celestial mechanics since [[Isaac Newton]].<ref>D. Stillwell, Mathematics and its history. pages = 434</ref>\n\nThese include the idea of Poincaré, who later became the base for mathematical \"[[chaos theory]]\" (see, in particular, the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]]) and the general theory of [[dynamical system]]s.\nPoincaré authored important works on astronomy for the equilibrium figures gravitating rotating fluid. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points, proved the existence of equilibrium figures of non-ellipsoid, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, their stability. For this discovery, Poincaré received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).<ref>A. Kozenko, The theory of planetary figures, pages = 25–26</ref>\n\n===Differential equations and mathematical physics===\nAfter defending his doctoral thesis on the study of singular points of the system of differential equations, Poincaré wrote a series of memoirs under the title \"On curves defined by differential equations\" (1881–1882). In these articles, he built a new branch of mathematics, called \"qualitative theory of differential equations.\" Poincaré showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, yet from the very form of the equation, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found. In particular, Poincaré investigated the nature of the trajectories of the integral curves in the plane, gave a classification of singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introduced the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index, and showed that the number of limit cycles is always finite, except for some special cases. Poincaré also developed a general theory of integral invariants and solutions of the variational equations. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction – the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of [[mathematical physics]] and [[celestial mechanics]], and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.<ref>Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century Vol = 3. page = 283 ISBN 978-3764358457</ref><ref>Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century. pages = 162–174</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"The singular points of the integral curves\">\n   File: Phase Portrait Sadle.svg | Saddle\n   File: Phase Portrait Stable Focus.svg | Focus\n   File: Phase portrait center.svg | Center\n   File: Phase Portrait Stable Node.svg | Node\n</gallery>\n\n===Assessments===\n{{Further|History of special relativity|Relativity priority dispute}}\nPoincaré's work in the development of special relativity is well recognised,<ref name=darrigol /> though most historians stress that despite many similarities with Einstein's work, the two had very different research agendas and interpretations of the work.<ref>Galison 2003 and Kragh 1999, Secondary sources on relativity</ref> Poincaré developed a similar physical interpretation of local time and noticed the connection to signal velocity, but contrary to Einstein he continued to use the ether-concept in his papers and argued that clocks in the ether show the \"true\" time, and moving clocks show the local time.

Poincaré by Henri Manuel]]\nPoincaré's work habits have been compared to a bee flying from flower to flower. Poincaré was interested in the way his mind worked; he studied his habits and gave a talk about his observations in 1908 at the Institute of General Psychology in Paris. He linked his way of thinking to how he made several discoveries.\n\nThe mathematician Darboux claimed he was ''un intuitif'' (intuitive), arguing that this is demonstrated by the fact that he worked so often by visual representation. He did not care about being rigorous and disliked logic. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}} (Despite this opinion, [[Jacques Hadamard]] wrote that Poincaré's research demonstrated marvelous clarity.<ref>J. Hadamard. L'oeuvre de H. Poincaré. Acta Mathematica, 38 (1921), p. 208</ref> and Poincaré himself wrote that he  <!-- TODO: Add Poincaré's opinion on rigorousness, see http://www.forgottenbooks.org/readbook/American_Journal_of_Mathematics_1890_v12_1000084889#233 — Each time I can I'm absolute rigour --> believed that logic was not a way to invent but a way to structure ideas and that logic limits ideas.)\n\n===Toulouse's characterisation===\nPoincaré's mental organisation was not only interesting to Poincaré himself but also to Édouard Toulouse, a psychologist of the Psychology Laboratory of the School of Higher Studies in Paris. Toulouse wrote a book entitled ''Henri Poincaré'' (1910).<ref>Toulouse, E.,1910. Henri Poincaré</ref><ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Henri Poincare|author=Toulouse, E.|date=2013|publisher=MPublishing|isbn=9781418165062|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mpjWPQAACAAJ|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>  In it, he discussed Poincaré's regular schedule:\n* He worked during the same times each day in short periods of time. He undertook mathematical research for four hours a day, between 10&nbsp;a.m. and noon then again from 5&nbsp;p.m. to 7&nbsp;p.m.. He would read articles in journals later in the evening.\n* His normal work habit was to solve a problem completely in his head, then commit the completed problem to paper.\n* He was ambidextrous and nearsighted.\n* His ability to visualise what he heard proved particularly useful when he attended lectures, since his eyesight was so poor that he could not see properly what the lecturer wrote on the blackboard.\n\nThese abilities were offset to some extent by his shortcomings:\n* He was physically clumsy and artistically inept.\n* He was always in a rush and disliked going back for changes or corrections.\n* He never spent a long time on a problem since he believed that the subconscious would continue working on the problem while he consciously worked on another problem.\n\nIn addition, Toulouse stated that most mathematicians worked from principles already established while Poincaré started from basic principles each time (O'Connor et al., 2002).\n\nHis method of thinking is well summarised as:\n\n{{quote|text=''Habitué à négliger les détails et à ne regarder que les cimes, il passait de l'une à l'autre avec une promptitude surprenante et les faits qu'il découvrait se groupant d'eux-mêmes autour de leur centre étaient instantanément et automatiquement classés dans sa mémoire.''

Poincaré strongly disagreed, claiming that [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] was the life of mathematics. Poincaré gives an interesting point of view in his book ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|text=For a superficial observer, scientific truth is beyond the possibility of doubt; the logic of science is infallible, and if the scientists are sometimes mistaken, this is only from their mistaking its rule.}}\n\nPoincaré believed that [[arithmetic]] is a [[Analytic/synthetic distinction|synthetic]] science. He argued that [[Peano's axioms]] cannot be proven non-circularly with the principle of induction (Murzi, 1998), therefore concluding that arithmetic is ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' synthetic and not analytic. Poincaré then went on to say that mathematics cannot be deduced from logic since it is not analytic. His views were similar to those of [[Immanuel Kant]] (Kolak, 2001, Folina 1992). He strongly opposed Cantorian [[set theory]], objecting to its use of [[Impredicativity|impredicative]] definitions.\n\nHowever, Poincaré did not share Kantian views in all branches of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincaré believed that the structure of [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean space]] can be known analytically. Poincaré held that convention plays an important role in physics. His view (and some later, more extreme versions of it) came to be known as \"[[conventionalism]]\". Poincaré believed that [[Newton's first law]] was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012).<ref>{{Citation|author= Gargani Julien|title=Poincaré, le hasard et l’étude des systèmes complexes|publisher=L’Harmattan|year=2012|page=124\n|url=http://www.editions-harmattan.fr/index.asp?navig=catalogue&obj=livre&no=38754}}</ref> He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean space where the rulers are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincaré thought that we were so accustomed to [[Euclidean geometry]] that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to a non-Euclidean physical geometry.<ref>{{Citation|title=Science and Hypothesis|first1=Henri |last1=Poincaré |publisher=Cosimo, Inc.

A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious...
