He became the first president of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]].\n\n==Career==\nH. L. Rietz earned his B.S. from [[Ohio State University]] in 1889. In 1902 he received a Ph.D. from [[Cornell University]] under [[George Abram Miller|G. A. Miller]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=38458}}</ref> Rietz was a professor of mathematics and astronomy at [[Butler University]] in [[Indianapolis]] for one year, before becoming a mathematics instructor at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1903. As instructor and then professor, he stayed at the U. of Illinois until his departure in 1918. From 1918 until his retirement in 1942,<ref>[http://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~dzimmer/alphaseminar/iowahistory.pdf \"On the History of the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Iowa\" by Robert V. Hogg and Dale L. Zimmerman]</ref> he was a mathematics professor and chair of the mathematics department at the [[University of Iowa]].\n\nIn addition to being a professor, Rietz worked as an actuary and consultant. For the year 1924, he was a president of the [[Mathematical Association of America]],<ref>[http://www.maa.org/history/presidents/rietz.html MAA presidents: Henry Louis Rietz]</ref> and, for the year 1930, president of the [[Iowa Academy of Science]]. In 1935 he was a founding member of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and became its first president, serving until 1937.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hogg, Robert V.|authorlink=Robert V.
