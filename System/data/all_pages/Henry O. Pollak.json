He received his [[B.Sc.]] in [[Mathematics]] (1947) from [[Yale University]]. While at Yale, he participated in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition and was on the team representing Yale University (along with [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Murray Gerstenhaber]]) that won the second prize in 1947. He earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] (1951) degree in [[mathematics]] from [[Harvard University]], the latter on the thesis ''Some Estimates for Extremal Distance'' advised by [[Lars Ahlfors]].\n\nPollak then joined [[Bell Labs]] (1951), where he in the early 1960s became director of the Mathematics and Statistics Research Center. He authored near forty papers, many of these with [[David Slepian]] and [[Henry Landau]] on analysis, function theory, probability theory, and mathematics education. He has applied mathematics to  solve problems in  physics and networks, communication theory, discrete systems, statistics and data analysis, and economic analysis. Pollak also holds patents in the area of signalling.<ref>{{US Patent|3710026}}</ref> He has held teaching positions in the mathematics department at [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Awards==\n*[[Earle Raymond Hedrick]] lecturer (1973)\n*[[Mathematical Association of America]] chair of New Jersey section (1958–59), governor (1961–63) and president (1975–76).<ref>[http://www.maa.org/history/presidents/pollak.html MAA presidents: Henry Otto Pollak]</ref>\n*honorary ''Sc.D.'' at [[Bowdoin College]] (1977)<ref>[http://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/subject/bowdoin/honors/pollak77.pdf Henry Otto Pollak, honorary Sc.D.] announcement</ref>\n*honorary doctorate from [[Technische Universiteit Eindhoven]] (1981)\n*Dan Christie lecture on ''On the Addressing Problem in Loop Switching, or, How to Embed an Arbitrary  Graph in a Squashed Cube'' at [[Bowdoin College]] (1983)\n*[[Mathematical Association of America]] Meritorious Service Award (1990)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Pollak, Henry\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = December 13, 1927\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pollak, Henry}}\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:American information theorists]]\n[[Category:American people of Austrian descent]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Austrian emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Austrian information theorists]]\n[[Category:Austrian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Austrian statisticians]]\n[[Category:Columbia University faculty]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Mathematical Association of America]]\n[[Category:Scientists at Bell Labs]]\n[[Category:Scientists from Vienna]]\n[[Category:Yale University alumni]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Henry O.
