In a ministerial career spanning nearly half a century he notably served as [[Home Secretary]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and was three times [[Lord President of the Council]].\n\n==Background and education==\nLansdowne was the son of Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne]] (better known as the Earl of Shelburne) by his second marriage to Lady Louisa, daughter of [[John FitzPatrick, 1st Earl of Upper Ossory]]. He was educated at [[Westminster School]], the [[University of Edinburgh]], and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=FTSY798HP|name=Fitzmaurice, Lord Henry Petty}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nHe entered the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1802 as member for the family borough of [[Calne (UK Parliament constituency)|Calne]] and quickly showed his mettle as a politician. In February 1806 he became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville's]] [[Ministry of All the Talents]], being at this time member for the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|University of Cambridge]], but he lost both his seat and his office in 1807. In 1809 he became Marquess of Lansdowne, and in the [[House of Lords]] and in society he continued to play an active part as one of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] leaders. His chief interest was perhaps in the question of Roman Catholic emancipation, a cause which he consistently championed, but he sympathised also with the advocates of the abolition of the slave-trade and with the cause of popular education. Lansdowne, who had succeeded his cousin, Francis Thomas Fitzmaurice, as 4th Earl of Kerry in 1818, took office with [[George Canning|Canning]] in May 1827 and was [[Secretary of State for the Home Department]] from July of that year until January 1828. \n\nHe was [[Lord President of the Council]] under [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]] and then under [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] from November 1830 to August 1841, with the exception of the few months in 1835 when Sir [[Robert Peel]] was prime minister. He held the same office during the whole of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell's]] ministry (1846–1852), and, having declined to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], sat in the cabinets of [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] and of [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], but without office. In 1857 he refused the offer of a dukedom, and he died on 31 January 1863. Lansdowne's social influence and political moderation made him one of the most powerful Whig statesmen of the time; he was frequently consulted by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] on matters of moment, and his long official experience made his counsel invaluable to his party.\n\n==Other public appointments==\nLansdowne chaired the inaugural meeting of the [[Royal Statistical Society|London Statistical Society]], and was its first president (1834–1836). He later served a second term (1842–1844). (See ''The Times'' 15 and 17 March 1834, and John Bibby (1987) ''HOTS: History of Teaching Statistics''.)\n\n==Family==\nLord Lansdowne married Lady Louisa, daughter of the [[Henry Fox-Strangways, 2nd Earl of Ilchester|2nd Earl of Ilchester]], in 1808. She died in April 1851, aged 65. Lord Lansdowne died in January 1863, aged 82. His eldest son, the [[William Petty-FitzMaurice, Earl of Kerry|Earl of Kerry]], had predeceased him and he was succeeded in the marquessate by his eldest surviving son [[Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 4th Marquess of Lansdowne|Henry]]. The latter was the father of [[Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne]], who also became a distinguished statesman.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[[Image:A great stream from a petty-fountain.jpg|thumb|right|300px|In ''A Great Stream from a Petty-Fountain'' (1806), [[James Gillray]] caricatured the budget of Petty, then the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, as a stream from which his fellow Whigs fed.
