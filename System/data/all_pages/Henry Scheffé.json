The family moved to [[Islip, New York]], where Scheffé went to high school. He graduated in 1924, took night classes at [[Cooper Union]], and a year later entered the [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University|Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn]]. He transferred to the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1928, and earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics there in 1931.<ref name=\"annals\"/> Staying at Wisconsin, he married his wife Miriam in 1934 and finished his Ph.D. in 1935, on the subject of [[differential equation]]s, under the supervision of [[Rudolf Ernest Langer]].<ref name=\"mactutor\"/><ref name=\"annals\"/><ref>{{MathGenealogy|title=Henry Scheffé |id=8054}}</ref>\n\nAfter teaching mathematics at Wisconsin, [[Oregon State University]], and [[Reed College]], Scheffé moved to [[Princeton University]] in 1941. At Princeton, he began working in statistics instead of in pure mathematics, and assisted the U.S. war effort as a consultant with the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]]. Scheffé moved several more times, to [[Syracuse University]] in 1944, the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1946, and [[Columbia University]] in 1948, where he chaired the statistics department. He settled at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1953 until he retired in 1974; he took a turn as department chair there as well, from 1965 to 1968. After retiring from Berkeley, he spent more years on the faculty of the [[University of Indiana]].<ref name=\"mactutor\"/><ref name=\"annals\"/>\n\nScheffé was president of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]] in 1954, and also served as vice president of the [[American Statistical Association]].<ref name=\"annals\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Scheffe, Henry\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 11 April 1907\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 5 June 1977\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scheffe, Henry}}\n[[Category:1907 births]]\n[[Category:1977 deaths]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]\n[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n\n\n{{US-statistician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Henry Scheffé"}}}}
