His family moved to [[New York City]] in the [[United States]]. Schultz completed his primary education, as well as undergraduate studies at the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]], receiving a BA in 1916. For graduate work, Henry Schultz enrolled at [[Columbia University]], but had to interrupt studies in 1917 because of [[World War I]]. After the war he received a scholarship which enabled him to spend 1919 at the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[Galton Laboratory]] of [[University College London]], where he had the opportunity to attend [[Karl Pearson]]'s lectures on statistics.\n\nAfter returning to the US, in 1920 Schultz married to Bertha Greenstein. In the future years, the couple had two daughters, Ruth and Jean. Schultz continued studying for his doctoral degree at Columbia, while at the same time conducting statistical work for the War Trade Board, the [[United States Census Bureau]] and the [[United States Department of Labor]]. He was awarded a PhD in economics from Columbia in 1925 with a thesis on the estimation of [[demand curve]]s written under the supervision of [[Henry L. Moore]].\n\nIn 1926, Schultz went to the [[University of Chicago]], where he spent the rest of his career teaching and doing research. In 1930, he was one of the sixteen founding members of the [[Econometric Society]]. Henry Schultz died on November 26, 1938, near [[San Diego, California]], in a car accident that also killed his wife and his two daughters.\n\n==Work==\nLed by his belief that economics needs rigorous quantitative study to become a science,<ref>Hotelling (1939).</ref> Henry Schultz was one of the founders of mathematical and statistical economics. His research was centered around a large program dedicated to the theory and estimation of private [[Supply and demand|demand]] for goods functions, a project which started in the early 1920s, during his studies at the University of Chicago, and was completed shortly before his death with the publication of his book, ''The Theory and Measurement of Demand''.\n\n===Selected publications===\n*{{cite journal | author=Schultz, Henry | title=The Statistical Law of Demand as Illustrated by the Demand for Sugar| journal=Journal of Political Economy| year=1925 | volume=XXXIII| issue=5 | pages=481–504 | doi=10.1086/253706}} and '''XXXIII''' (6): 577-637.

This prompted the University to invite the [[Cowles Commission]], which had a research agenda focused on empirical economics, to move its headquarters there. As a result, the Commission moved to the University of Chicago in 1939 and Theodore O. Yntema, one of Schultz's students, was named as its new president.<ref>Cowles Commission, [http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/reports/1932-52a.htm \"Economic Theory and Measurement.
