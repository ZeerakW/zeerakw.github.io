He did research in [[topology]], [[measure theory]], [[statistics]], and a variety of other fields.  \n \nHe was the co-author, with [[Richard Courant]], of ''[[What is Mathematics?]]'', a popularization that is still ({{As of|2012|lc=on}}) in print.  The [[Robbins lemma]], used in [[empirical Bayes method]]s, is named after him.  [[Robbins algebra]]s are named after him because of a conjecture (since proved) that he posed concerning [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]]. The [[Robbins theorem]], in [[graph theory]], is also named after him, as is the [[Ear decomposition|Whitney–Robbins synthesis]], a tool he introduced to prove this theorem. The well-known unsolved problem of minimizing in sequential selection the expected rank of the selected item under full information, sometimes referred to as the fourth [[secretary problem]], also bears his name: [[Robbins' problem (of optimal stopping)]].\n\n==Biography==\nRobbins was born in [[New Castle, Pennsylvania|New Castle]], [[Pennsylvania]].\n\nAs an undergraduate, Robbins attended [[Harvard University]], where [[Marston Morse]] influenced him to become interested in mathematics.  Robbins received a [[doctorate]] from Harvard in 1938 under the supervision of [[Hassler Whitney]] and was an instructor at [[New York University]] from 1939 to 1941.  After [[World War II]], Robbins taught at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] from 1946 to 1952, where he was one of the original members of the department of mathematical statistics, then spent a year at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].  In 1953, he became a professor of mathematical statistics at [[Columbia University]].  He retired from full-time activity at Columbia in 1985 and was then a professor at [[Rutgers University]] until his retirement in 1997.  He has  567 descendants listed at the  [http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=7781 Mathematics Genealogy Project].\n\nIn 1955, Robbins introduced [[empirical Bayes method]]s at the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability.  Robbins was also one of the inventors of the first [[stochastic approximation]] algorithm, the Robbins-Monro method,  and worked on the theory of [[power-one test]]s and [[optimal stopping]]. In 1985, in the paper   \"Asymptotically efficient adaptive allocation rules\", with TL Lai,  he constructed uniformly convergent population selection policies for the [[Multi-armed bandit]] problem that possess the fastest rate of convergence to the population with highest mean, for the case that the population reward distributions are the one-parameter exponential family. These policies were simplified  in \nthe 1995 paper \"Sequential choice from several populations\", with MN Katehakis.\n\nHe was a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and was past president of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]].\n\n==Selected writings==\n;Books by Herbert Robbins\n* ''What is Mathematics?
