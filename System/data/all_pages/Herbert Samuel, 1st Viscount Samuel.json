The building now houses part of [[the Belvedere Academy]]. He was the brother of Sir [[Stuart Samuel]]. He was educated at [[University College School]] in [[Hampstead]], London and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He had a religious [[Jew]]ish upbringing but in 1892 while at Oxford he renounced all religious belief, and wrote to his Jewish mother to inform her. He had been influenced by the work of [[Charles Darwin]] and the book ''On Compromise'' by senior Liberal politician [[John Morley]].<ref>Memoirs by Viscount Samuel (1945)</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2014}} However, he remained a member of the Jewish community to please his wife,<ref>{{cite web|last=Wasserstein|first=Bernard|title=Samuel, Herbert Louis|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35928?docPos=1|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=22 March 2014}}</ref> and kept kosher and the Sabbath \"for hygienic reasons.\"<ref>Wasserstein, Bernard, ''\"Herbert Samuel: A Political Life\"'' 1992, p.9. Cited by Huneidi, Sahar \"A Broken Trust, Herbert Samuel, Zionism and the Palestinians\", 2001. p.80</ref>\n\nSamuel unsuccessfully fought two general elections before being elected a [[Member of Parliament]] at the [[Cleveland by-election, 1902]], as a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. He was appointed to the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] in 1909 by Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith|Herbert Henry Asquith]], first as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], and then later as [[Postmaster General]], [[President of the Local Government Board]], and eventually [[Home Secretary]]. He put forward the idea of establishing a British [[Protectorate]] over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1915 and his ideas influenced the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]]. As Home Secretary, Samuel faced a shortage of manpower needed to fight in [[World War I]], and initiated legislation which offered thousands of Russian refugees (many of them young Jews) a choice between conscription into the [[British Army]], or returning to Russia for military service.<ref>Modern British Jewry, Geoffrey Alderman, Oxford University Press p.237-238</ref>\n\nIn December 1916 Asquith was replaced as Prime Minister by [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]]. Lloyd George asked Samuel to continue as Home Secretary, but Samuel chose to resign instead.<ref>Memoirs by Viscount Samuel (1945)</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2014}} He attempted to strike a balance between giving support to the new government while remaining loyal to Asquith. At the end of the war he sought election at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|general election of 1918]] as a Liberal in support of the Coalition government. However, the government's endorsement was given to his Unionist opponent and he was defeated.\n\n===Women's rights===\nInitially he had not been a supporter of [[women's suffrage]] but changed his position. In 1917 a Speakers Conference was charged with looking into giving women the vote but did not have as its terms of reference, consideration to women standing as candidates for parliament. However, Samuel moved a separate motion on 23 October 1918 to allow women to be eligible as Members of Parliament. The vote was passed by 274 to 25 and the government rushed through a Bill to make it law in time for the 1918 General Election.<ref>Memoirs, Viscount Samuel (1950) p131</ref>\n\n==Appointment as High Commissioner of Palestine==\n\nTwo months after Britain's declaration of war on the [[Ottoman Empire]] in November 1914, Samuel circulated a memorandum entitled ''[[s:The Future of Palestine|The Future of Palestine]]'' to his cabinet colleagues, suggesting that Palestine become a home for the [[Jews|Jewish people]] under British rule.<ref>C.D. Smith, 2001, 'Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict', 4th ed., ISBN 0-312-20828-6, p. 60,112</ref> The memorandum stated that \"I am assured that the solution of the problem of Palestine which would be much the most welcome to the leaders and supporters of the Zionist movement throughout the world would be the annexation of the country to the [[British Empire]]\".\n\nIn 1917, Britain occupied Palestine (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]) during the course of the First World War. Samuel lost his seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|election of 1918]] and became a candidate to represent British interests in the territory. He was appointed to the position of [[High Commissioner]] in 1920, before the Council of the [[League of Nations]] approved a British mandate for Palestine. Nonetheless, the military government withdrew to [[Cairo]] in preparation for the expected British [[League of Nations mandate|Mandate]], which was finally granted 2 years later by the [[League of Nations]]. He served as High Commissioner until 1925 {{ref|govpal}}. Samuel was the first Jew to govern the historic land of [[Israel]] in 2,000 years.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/samuel.html Jewish Virtual Library] Herbert Louis Samuel (1870 - 1963)</ref> He recognised [[Hebrew]] as one of the three official languages of the Mandate territory. He was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]] (GBE) on 11 June 1920.\n\nSamuel's appointment to High Commissioner of Palestine was controversial. While the Zionists welcomed the appointment of a [[Zionism|Zionist Jew]] to the post, the military government, headed by [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]] and [[Louis Bols|Bols]], called Samuel's appointment \"highly dangerous\".<ref>Vital, ''Zionism'', p. 83. Also Knox, ''The Making of a New Eastern Question'', p. 153, and Ingrams, ''Palestine Papers'', p. 105.</ref> Technically, Allenby noted, the appointment was illegal, in that a civil administration that would compel the inhabitants of an occupied country to express their allegiance to it before a formal peace treaty (with [[Turkey]]) was signed, was in violation of both [[military law]] and the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]].<ref>Henry Laurens, ''La Question de Palestine'', Fayard, Paris 1999 vol.1 p.523</ref> Bols said the news was received with '(c)onsternation, despondency and exasperation' by the Moslem [and] Christian population ... They are convinced that he will be a partisan Zionist and that he represents a Jewish and not a British Government.'<ref>Ingrams, ''Palestine Papers'', p. 106.</ref> Allenby said that the Arabs would see it \"as handing country over at once to a permanent Zionist Administration\" and predicted numerous degrees of violence. Lord Curzon read this last message to Samuel and asked him to reconsider accepting the post. (Samuel took advice from a delegation representing the Zionists which was in London at the time, who told him that these 'alarmist' reports were not justified.<ref>Samuel, Memoirs, p.&nbsp;152.</ref> The [[Muslim-Christian Associations|Muslim-Christian Association]] had sent a telegram to Bols: <blockquote>'Sir Herbert Samuel regarded as a Zionist leader, and his appointment as first step in formation of Zionist national home in the midst of Arab people contrary to their wishes. Inhabitants cannot recognise him, and Muslim-Christian Society cannot accept responsibility for riots or other disturbances of peace'.</blockquote> The wisdom of appointing Samuel was debated in the [[House of Lords]] a day before he arrived in Palestine. [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] said that no 'disparaging' remarks had been made during the debate, but that 'very grave doubts have been expressed as to the wisdom of sending a Jewish Administrator to the country at this moment'. Questions in the House of Commons of the period also show much concern about the choice of Samuel, asking amongst other things 'what action has been taken to placate the Arab population ... and thereby put an end to racial tension'. Three months after his arrival, the Morning Post wrote that 'Sir Herbert Samuel's appointment as High Commissioner was regarded by everyone, except Jews, as a serious mistake.'\n\n[[File:Jerusalem King George plaque.jpg|thumb|250px|Historic plaque on King George Street, [[Jerusalem]], affixed in 1924 by Herbert Samuel during his term as High Commissioner of Palestine]]\n[[File:Flickr - …trialsanderrors - On the Aerodrome at Amman, T.E.

He hoped to gain Arab participation in mandate affairs and to guard their civil and economic rights, while at the same time refusing them any authority that could be used to stop Jewish immigration and land purchase.<ref>C.D. Smith, 2001, 'Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict', 4th ed., ISBN 0-312-20828-6, p. 110-112</ref> According to Wasserstein his policy was \"subtly designed to reconcile Arabs to the [...] pro-Zionist policy\" of the British.<ref>B. Wasserstein, 1978, 'British in Palestine', p.92</ref> [[Islam]]ic custom at the time was that the chief Islamic spiritual leader, the [[Grand Mufti]] of Jerusalem, was to be chosen by the temporal ruler, the Ottoman [[Sultan]] in [[Constantinople]], from a group of [[clerics]] that were nominated by the indigenous clerics. After the British conquered Palestine, Samuel chose [[Amin al-Husayni|Hajj Amin Al Husseini]], who later proved a thorn in the side of the British administration in Palestine. At the same time, he enjoyed the respect of the Jewish community, and was honored by being called to the [[Torah reading|Torah]] at the [[Hurva synagogue]] in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]].<ref>[Horovitz, Ahron. ''Jerusalem, Footsteps Through Time'', pp.171-174, [[Feldheim Publishers|Feldheim]], 2000. ISBN 1583303987]</ref>\n\nDuring Samuel’s administration the [[Churchill White Paper|White Paper of 1922]] was published, supporting Jewish immigration within the absorptive capacity of the country and defining the Jewish national homeland as “not the imposition of a Jewish nationality upon the inhabitants of Palestine as a whole, but the further development of the existing Jewish community, with the assistance of Jews in other parts of the world, in order that it may become a centre in which the Jewish people as a whole may take, on grounds of religion and race, an interest and a pride.”<ref>[http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Palestine_Correspondence_with_the_Palestine_Arab_Delegation_and_the_Zionist_Organization_%28Cmd._1700%29_%28White_Paper_of_1922%29_%E2%80%93_June_1%2C_1922.

Frantzman|author2=Ruth Kark|page=16|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nSamuel's role in Palestine is still debated. According to Wasserstein, \"He is remembered kindly neither by the majority of Zionist historians, who tend to regard him as one of the originators of the process whereby the Balfour Declaration in favour of Zionism was gradually diluted and ultimately betrayed by Great Britain, nor by Arab nationalists who regard him as a personification of the alliance between Zionism and British imperialism and as one of those responsible for the displacement of the Palestinian Arabs from their homeland. In fact, both are mistaken.\"<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bernard Wasserstein | title = Herbert Samuel and the Palestine Problem | journal = The English Historical Review | volume = 91 | year = 1976 | pages=753–775 | doi=10.1093/ehr/xci.ccclxi.753}}</ref>\n\n==Return to Britain==\nOn his return to Britain in 1925, Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] asked Samuel to look into the problems of the mining industry. The Samuel Commission published its report in March 1926 recommending that the industry be reorganised but rejecting the suggestion of [[nationalization|nationalisation]]. The report also recommended that the Government subsidy should be withdrawn and the miners' wages should be reduced. The report was one of the leading factors that led to the [[UK General Strike 1926|1926 General Strike]].\n\n[[File:Vera & Chaim Weizmann, Herbert Samuel, Lloyd George, Ethel Snowden, Philip Snowden.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Vera Weizmann]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], Herbert Samuel, [[Lloyd George]], [[Ethel Snowden]] and [[Philip Snowden]]]]\nSamuel returned to the House of Commons following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 General Election]]. Two years later he became deputy leader of the Liberal Party and acted as leader in the summer of 1931 when Lloyd George was ill. Under Samuel the party served in the first [[National Government (UK)|National Government]] of Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed in August 1931, with Samuel himself serving as [[Home Secretary]]. However the government's willingness to consider the introduction of [[protectionism|protectionist tariffs]] and to call a general election to seek a mandate led to the Liberal Party fragmenting into three distinct groups. [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] had already led a breakaway group of MPs to form the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal National party]].\n\nThe Liberal leader, Lloyd George, led a small group of [[Independent Liberals (UK, 1931)|Independent Liberals]] who decided to oppose the National Government. This left Samuel effectively as leader of the parliamentary party and in control of party headquarters. The government's moves to introduce tariffs caused further friction for the Liberals and Samuel withdrew the party from the government in stages, first obtaining the suspension of [[cabinet collective responsibility]] on the matter to allow Liberal members of the government to oppose tariffs, then in October 1932 the Liberal ministers resigned their ministerial posts but continued to support the National Government in Parliament, and finally in November 1933 Samuel and the bulk of the Liberal MPs [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] of the House of Commons to now oppose the government outright. He remained leader of the Liberal Party until he again lost his seat in 1935.\n\nIn 1937, he was granted the title [[Viscount Samuel]]; later that year, Samuel, despite being born into a Jewish family, aligned himself with Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s appeasement policy towards [[Adolf Hitler]] and urged that Germany be cleared of its 1914 war guilt and recommending the return of [[German colonies]] lost after the war. He declined a later offer by Chamberlain to return to government. In 1938, he supported the [[Kindertransport]] movement for refugee children from Europe with an appeal for homes for them.\n\nSamuel later became the leader of the Liberal Party in the [[House of Lords]] (1944-1955). During the 1951 general election, on 15 October 1951, Samuel became the first British politician to deliver a party political broadcast on television.<ref>Wasserstein, Bernard, \"Herbert Samuel: A Political Life\" 1992,p.396</ref>\n\nHis son, [[Edwin Herbert Samuel, 2nd Viscount Samuel|Edwin]], served in the [[Jewish Legion]].\n\n==Literary career==\nIn his later years, he remained concerned over the future of humanity and of science, writing three books: \"Essays in Physics\" (1951), \"In Search of Reality\" (1957) and a collaborative work, \"A Threefold Cord: Philosophy, Science, Religion\" (1961). The three works tended to conflict with the beliefs of the scientific establishment, especially as his collaborator and friend in the last work was [[Herbert Dingle]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n*{{cite book|author=[[John Edward Bowle]]|title=Viscount Samuel: A Biography|publisher=Victor Gollancz|date=1957}}\n*{{cite book|first=Viscount Herbert|last=Samuel|title=Memoirs|publisher=London|date=1945}}\n*{{cite book|first=Sahar|last=Huneidi|title=A Broken Trust, Herbert Samuel, Zionism and the Palestinians|place=London|date=2001}}\n*{{cite book|first=Tom|last=Segev|title=One Palestine, complete: Jews and Arabs under the British mandate|place=London|publisher=Little, Brown|date=2000|isbn=0-316-64859-0}}\n*{{cite journal|first=Bernard|last=Wasserstein|title=Herbert Samuel and the Palestin Problem|journal=English Historical Review|volume=91|issue=361|date=Oct 1976|ref=pp.753-75}}\n*{{cite book|first=Bernard|last=Wasserstein|title=Herbert Samuel: A Political Life|publisher=Clarendon Press|date=1992}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Herbert Samuel}}\n*[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/searches/PIdocs.asp?P=P25269 National Register of Archives: Herbert Samuel]\n*[http://www.portcullis.parliament.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=3&dsqSearch=(RefNo='SAM') Papers of Herbert Samuel] at the UK Parliamentary Archives\n*[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp05729 National Portrait Gallery: Herbert Samuel]\n*[http://www.spartacus-educational.com/PRsamuel.htm Spartacus Educational: Herbert Samuel]\n*[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~macculloch/p134.htm#i7225 Family History of Margaret Macculloch and David Hall covering dates c1150-2004 Person Page 134]{{clarify|date=January 2013}}\n*[http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=16&item=biography Biography of Samuel at the website of the Liberal Democrat History Group]\n* Album MIZPAH: Publication of an album which was given to Herbert Samuel by the members of the American Colony in 1925.
