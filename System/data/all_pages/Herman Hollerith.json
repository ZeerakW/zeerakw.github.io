He was the founder of ''[[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company#The Tabulating Machine Company|The Tabulating Machine Company]]'' that was [[Holding company|consolidated]] in 1911 with three other companies to form the [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company]], later renamed [[IBM]].

A key idea was that data could be encoded by the locations of holes in a card.  Hollerith determined that data punched in specified locations on a card, in the now-familiar rows and columns, could be counted or sorted mechanically. A description of this system, ''An Electric Tabulating System (1889)'', was submitted by Hollerith to Columbia University as his doctoral thesis, and is reprinted in Randell's book.<ref>{{cite book | last = Randell (ed.) | first = Brian | title = The Origins of Digital Computers, Selected Papers |edition=3rd | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-387-11319-3}}</ref> On January 8, 1889, Hollerith was issued U.S. Patent 395,782,<ref>{{Cite patent|country=US|number=395782|status=patent|title=Art of compiling statistics|inventor=Herman Hollerith|pridate=1884-09-23|gdate=1889-01-08}}</ref> claim 2 of which reads:\n\n[[File:HollerithMachine.CHM.jpg|thumb|left|Hollerith tabulating machine and sorting box.<ref>The \"sorting box\" was controlled by the tabulator.

That census, using the tabulators, required only six years; the previous [[United States Census, 1880|1880 census]] had taken eight years.<ref>Report of the Commissioner of Labor  \nIn Charge of The Eleventh Census to the  \nSecretary of the Interior  \nfor the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1895    \nWashington, D.C., July 29 1895    \nPage 9:    \n{{You may confidently look for the rapid reduction of the force of this office after the 1st of October, and the entire cessation of clerical work during the present calendar year. ...

Wright  \nCommissioner of Labor in Charge</ref>\n<ref>Wright's \"Two years earlier\" is not simply the result of using the Hollerith tabulators; the time to complete a census is also dependent on details such as: headcount, items to be tabulated/reported, and the publication schedule.</ref>\nIn 1896 Hollerith started his own business when he founded ''The Tabulating Machine Company''. Many major census bureaus around the world leased his equipment and purchased his cards, as did major insurance companies. Hollerith's machines were used for censuses in England, Italy, Germany, Russia, Austria, Canada, France, Norway, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines, and again in the [[United States Census, 1900|1900 census]].<ref name=\"Cruz\"/> To make his system work, he invented the first automatic card-feed mechanism and the first [[keypunch]] (that is, a punch operated by a [[Keyboard technology|keyboard]]); a skilled operator could punch 200–300 cards per hour. He also invented a [[Tabulating machine|tabulator]]. The 1890 Tabulator was [[hardwired]] to operate only on 1890 Census cards. A [[plugboard]] control panel in his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to do different jobs without being rewired. These inventions were among the foundations of the data processing industry and Hollerith's punched cards (later used for recording machine-readable computer programs) continued in use for almost a century.\n\nIn 1911 four corporations, including Hollerith's firm, were consolidated to form the [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company]] (CTR).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/documents/pdf/faq.pdf|format=PDF| title=IBM Archives: Frequently Asked Questions}} Some accounts of the consolidation forming CTR state that only three corporations were included. This reference notes that only three of the four corporations are represented in the CTR name. That may be the reason for the differing accounts.</ref> Under the presidency of [[Thomas J. Watson]], it was renamed [[International Business Machines|International Business Machines Corporation]] (IBM) in 1924.\n\n==Death and legacy==\nHollerith is buried at [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]] in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C.,<ref>http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=14503488</ref> as is his son, Herman Hollerith Jr.\n\n[[Hollerith card]]s were named after the elder Herman Hollerith, as were [[Hollerith constant]]s (also sometimes called Hollerith strings), an early type of string constant declaration (in computer programming).\n\nHis great-grandson, the Rt.
