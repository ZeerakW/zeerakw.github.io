He created and developed the [[geometry of numbers]] and used geometrical methods to solve problems in [[number theory]], [[mathematical physics]], and the [[theory of relativity]].\n\nMinkowski is perhaps best known for his work in relativity, in which he showed in 1907 that his former student [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]] (1905), could  be understood geometrically as a theory of four-dimensional space–time, since known as the \"[[Minkowski spacetime]]\".\n\n==Personal life and family==\nHermann Minkowski was born in [[Aleksotas]], a village in the [[Kovno Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now incorporated into the city of [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]]) to Lewin Boruch Minkowski, a merchant who subsidized the building of [[Kaunas Synagogue|The Choral synagogue in Kovno]],<ref>[http://www.berkovich-zametki.com/Nomer16/Chaesh1.htm А.

He married Auguste Adler in 1897 with whom he had two daughters; the electrical engineer and inventor [[Reinhold Rudenberg]] was his son-in-law.\n\nMinkowski died suddenly of [[appendicitis]] in Göttingen on 12 January 1909. [[David Hilbert]]'s obituary of Minkowski illustrates the deep friendship between the two mathematicians (translated):\n:Since my student years Minkowski was my best, most dependable friend who supported me with all the depth and loyalty that was so characteristic of him.  Our science, which we loved above all else, brought us together; it seemed to us a garden full of flowers.  In it, we enjoyed looking for hidden pathways and discovered many a new perspective that appealed to our sense of beauty, and when one of us showed it to the other and we marveled over it together, our joy was complete.  He was for me a rare gift from heaven and I must be grateful to have possessed that gift for so long.  Now death has suddenly torn him from our midst.  However, what death cannot take away is his noble image in our hearts and the knowledge that his spirit continues to be active in us.\n\nThe [[asteroid]] [[12493 Minkowski]] and [[M-matrix|M-matrices]] are named in Minkowski's honor.\n\n==Education and career==\nMinkowski was educated in Germany at the ''Albertina'' [[University of Königsberg]], where he earned his doctorate in 1885 under the direction of [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]]. In 1883, while still a student at Königsberg, he was awarded the Mathematics Prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] for his manuscript on the theory of [[quadratic form]]s. He also became a friend of another renowned mathematician, [[David Hilbert]]. His brother, [[Oskar Minkowski]] (1858–1931), was a well-known physician and researcher.\n\nMinkowski taught at the universities of [[Bonn]], [[Göttingen]], [[Königsberg]] and [[Zürich]]. At the [[Federal Polytechnic Institute|''Eidgenössische Polytechnikum'']], today the [[ETH Zurich]], he was one of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s teachers.\n\nMinkowski explored the arithmetic of [[quadratic form]]s, especially concerning ''n'' variables, and his research into that topic led him to consider certain geometric properties in a space of ''n'' [[dimension]]s. In 1896, he presented his ''[[geometry of numbers]]'', a geometrical method that solved problems in [[number theory]]. He is also the creator of the Minkowski Sausage and the Minkowski cover of a curve.<ref>[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=minkowski+sausage&a=*C.minkowski+sausage-_*MathWorld-&f2=3&f=MinkowskiSausage.n%5Cu005f3 \"Minkowski Sausage\"], ''[[WolframAlpha]]''</ref>\n\nIn 1902, he joined the Mathematics Department of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and became a close colleague of [[David Hilbert]], whom he first met at university in Königsberg.  [[Constantin Carathéodory]] was one of his students there.\n\n== Work on relativity ==\n{{Further|History of special relativity|Minkowski space|Minkowski diagram}}\n\nBy 1907 Minkowski realized that the [[special theory of relativity]], introduced by  his former student [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905 and based on the previous work of [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], could best be understood in a four-dimensional space, since known as the \"[[Minkowski spacetime]]\", in which [[time]] and [[space]] are not separated entities but intermingled in a four dimensional [[space–time]], and in which the [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz geometry]] of special relativity can be effectively represented. The beginning part of his address delivered at the 80th ''Assembly of German Natural Scientists and Physicians'' (21 September 1908) is now famous:\n\n<blockquote>'''''\"The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.\"'''''</blockquote>\n\nNotice of Minkowski's death was communicated to the [[Quaternion Society]] in 1910 by its President who had explored [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s as the \"Algebra of Space\":\n:He devoted what proved to be the last years of his life to the scientific statement of fundamental equations of electrodynamics, a work which he accomplished by development of the Algebra of Space, or as he would prefer to call it, the Algebra of Space and Time.<ref>[[Alexander Macfarlane]] (1910) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=335 Bulletin of the Quaternion Society]</ref>\n\nEinstein at first viewed Minkowski's treatment as a mere mathematical trick, before eventually realizing that a geometrical view of space–time would be necessary in order to complete his own later work in [[general relativity]] (1915).<ref>http://www.fisica.net/relatividade/the_non_euclidean_style_of_minkowskian_relativity_by_scott_walter.pdf  (Einstein also had need of a third theory and technique, elaborated by his former mathematics professor, Hermann Minkowski (1864–1909), although he did not recognize this for several years.)</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n;Relativity papers\n* {{Cite journal\n|doi=10.1002/andp.19153521505\n|author=Minkowski, Hermann\n|origyear=1907|year=1915\n|title=[[s:de:Das Relativitätsprinzip (Minkowski)|Das Relativitätsprinzip]]\n|journal=Annalen der Physik\n|volume=352\n|issue=15\n|pages=927–938|bibcode = 1915AnP...352..927M }}\n\n* {{Cite journal\n|author=Minkowski, Hermann\n|year=1908\n|title=[[s:de:Die Grundgleichungen für die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Körpern|Die Grundgleichungen für die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Körpern]]\n|journal=Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse\n|pages=53–111}}\n**English translation: [[s:Translation:The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies|The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies]].
