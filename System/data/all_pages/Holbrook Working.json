Working earned his Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1921. He taught at [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of Minnesota]] before he joined Stanford's Food Research Institute in 1925. His younger brother [[Elmer Working]] made a major contribution on the [[parameter identification problem|identification problem for demand curves]] in econometrics, with which Holbrook Working was also involved.\n\nWorking disagreed with [[Keynes]]’s [[backwardation]] theory of futures prices, which argued that short hedgers (farmers) drive down futures prices because of their demand for ''price insurance''. Working argued that there could be hedgers on both sides of the market and that hedging was essentially not a risk reduction technique, but \"speculation in the basis\" which allows informed traders and commodity dealers to profit from their knowledge of future changes in the difference between futures and spot prices.\n\nHe was a founding member of the [[Econometric Society]] and was elected a Fellow of the American Agricultural Economics Association, the [[American Statistical Association]], and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].<ref>[http://histsoc.stanford.edu/pdfmem/WorkingH.pdf Stanford Historical Society] accessed 4/24/07.</ref>  In 1981 he was awarded the [[Wilks Memorial Award]] by the American Statistical Association.\n\n== Notable papers ==\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Working | first1 = Holbrook | title = The statistical determination of demand curves | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics|The Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 503–543 | publisher = Oxford Journals | doi = 10.2307/1883264 | date = August 1925 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1883264 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Working | first1 = Holbrook | title = ''Business cycles: the problem and its setting'', by Wesley C.
