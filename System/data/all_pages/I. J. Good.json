After World War II, Good continued to work with Turing on the design of computers and [[Bayesian statistics]] at the [[University of Manchester]]. Good moved to the United States where he was professor at [[Virginia Tech]].\n\nHe was born '''Isadore Jacob Gudak''' to a Polish Jewish family in London. He later anglicised his name to Irving John Good and signed his publications \"'''I. J. Good'''.\"\n\nAn originator of the concept now known as \"[[intelligence explosion]],\" Good served as consultant on supercomputers to [[Stanley Kubrick]], director of the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref name = GuardianObit/>\n\n==Life==\nGood was born Isadore Jacob Gudak to Polish Jewish parents in London. His father was a watchmaker, who later managed and owned a successful fashionable jewellery shop, and was also a notable Yiddish writer writing under the pen-name of Moshe Oved. Good was educated at [[the Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]], at the time in [[Hampstead]] in north west London, where, [[Dan van der Vat]] writes, Good effortlessly outpaced the mathematics curriculum.<ref name = GuardianObit>{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/apr/29/jack-good-codebreaker-obituary\n|author=Dan van der Vat\n|title=\"Jack Good\" (obituary)\n|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''\n|date=29 April 2009, p. 32.\n|accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nGood studied mathematics at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1938 and winning the [[Smith's Prize]] in 1940. He did research under [[G.H. Hardy]] and [[Besicovitch]] before moving to Bletchley Park in 1941 on completing his doctorate.\n\n===Bletchley Park===\nOn 27 May 1941, having just obtained his doctorate at Cambridge, Good walked into [[Hut 8]], Bletchley's facility for breaking German naval ciphers, for his first shift.  This was the day that Britain's [[Royal Navy]] destroyed the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||6}} after it had sunk the Royal Navy's {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}. Bletchley had contributed to ''Bismarck''{{'}}s destruction by discovering, through wireless-traffic analysis, that the German flagship was sailing for [[Brest, France]], rather than [[Wilhelmshaven]], from which she had set out.<ref name = GuardianObit />\nHut 8 had not, however, been able to decrypt on a current basis the 22 German Naval [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages that had been sent to ''Bismarck''.  The German Navy's Enigma ciphers were considerably more secure than those of the German Army or Air Force, which had been well penetrated by 1940. Naval messages were taking three to seven days to decrypt, which usually made them operationally useless for the British. This was about to change, however, with Good's help.<ref name = GuardianObit />\n\n{{blockquote|[[Alan Turing]]... had caught Good sleeping on the floor while on duty during his first night shift.  At first, Turing thought Good was ill, but he was cross when Good explained that he was just taking a short nap because he was tired.  For days afterwards, Turing would not deign to speak to Good, and he left the room if Good walked in.  The new recruit only won Turing's respect after he solved the bigram tables problem. During a subsequent night shift, when there was no more work to be done, it dawned on Good that there might be another chink in the German indicating system.  The German telegraphists had to add dummy letters to the trigrams which they selected out of the ''kenngruppenbuch''... Good wondered if their choice of dummy letters was random, or whether there was a bias towards particular letters. After inspecting some messages which had been broken, he discovered that there was a tendency to use some letters more than others. That being the case, all the codebreakers had to do, was to work back from the indicators given at the beginning of each message, and apply each bigram table in turn in the same way as [[Joan Clarke]] had done before. The bigram table which produced one of the popular dummy letters was probably the correct one.  When Good mentioned his discovery to Alan Turing, Turing was very embarrassed, and said, 'I could have sworn that I tried that.' It quickly became an important part of the [[Banburismus]] procedure.\n\nJack Good's refusal to go on working when tired was vindicated by a subsequent incident.  During another long night shift, he had been baffled by his failure to break a doubly enciphered ''Offizier'' message. This was one of the messages which was supposed to be enciphered initially with the Enigma set up in accordance with the ''Offizier'' settings, and subsequently with the general Enigma settings in place. However, while he was sleeping before returning for another shift, he dreamed that the order had been reversed; the general settings had been applied before the ''Offizier'' settings. Next day he found that the message had yet to be read, so he applied the theory which had come to him during the night. It worked; he had broken the code in his sleep.<ref>[[Hugh Sebag-Montefiore]], ''Enigma: The Battle for the Code'', p. 189.</ref>}}\n\nGood served with Turing for nearly two years.<ref name = GuardianObit />\n  \nSubsequently he worked with [[Donald Michie]] in [[Max Newman]]'s group on the [[FISH (cryptography)|Fish]] [[cipher]]s, leading to the development of the [[Colossus computer]].\n\nGood was a member of the Bletchley Chess Club which defeated the [[Oxford University Chess Club]] 8–4 in a twelve-board team match held on 2 December 1944.  Good played fourth board for Bletchley Park, with [[C.H.O'D. Alexander]], [[Harry Golombek]], and [[James Macrae Aitken]] in the top three spots.<ref>[http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter16.html#4032._The_Polish_Defence_C.N._4014 Chess Notes 4034.

There for three years Good lectured in mathematics and researched computers, including the [[Manchester Mark 1]].<ref name = GuardianObit />\n\nIn 1948 Good was recruited by the Government Communications Headquarters ([[GCHQ]]), successor to [[Bletchley Park]]. He remained there until 1959, while also taking up a brief associate professorship at [[Princeton University]] and a short consultancy with [[IBM]].<ref name = GuardianObit />\n\nFrom 1959 until he moved to the US in 1967, Good held government-funded positions and from 1964 a senior research fellowship at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], and the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]], where he continued his interests in computing, statistics and chess.<ref name=\"The Times\"/> He later left Oxford, declaring it \"a little stiff\".\n\n===United States===\nIn 1967 Good moved to the United States, where he was appointed a research professor of statistics at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]]. In 1969 he was appointed a University Distinguished Professor at Virginia Tech, and in 1994 Emeritus University Distinguished Professor.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Good, Irving John | work = CV | publisher = [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] | date =  24 4 July | url = http://www.stat.vt.edu/facstaff/IJGoodVitae.pdf | accessdate = 4 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\nHe later said about his arrival in Virginia (from England) in 1967 to start teaching at VPI, where he taught from 1967 to 1994:\n\n{{quote|\"I arrived in Blacksburg in the seventh hour of the seventh day of the seventh month of the year seven in the seventh decade, and I was put in Apartment 7 of Block 7...all by chance.\"<ref>{{citation|title=The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century|first=David|last=Salsburg|publisher=Macmillan|year=2002|isbn=9781466801783|page=222|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VCw_RxBrJc8C&pg=PA222}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Research and publications==\nGood's published work ran to over three million words.<ref name = GuardianObit />\nHe was known for his work on [[Bayesian statistics]].
