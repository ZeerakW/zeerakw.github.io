He built on the legacy of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] generalizing his [[least squares]] method. He contributed to the fields of [[probability]] and [[statistics]], and to their application to [[finance]], [[demography]] and [[social science]]s. In particular, he formulated the [[Bienaymé–Chebyshev inequality]] concerning the law of large numbers and the [[Variance#Sum of uncorrelated variables (Bienaymé formula)|Bienaymé formula]] for the [[variance]] of a sum of uncorrelated random variables.\n\n==Biography==\nWith Irénée-Jules Bienaymé ends the line of great French probability thinkers{{says who?|date=August 2015}} that began with [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]], then continued with [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] and [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]]. After Bienaymé, progress in statistics took place in the [[UK]] and [[Russia]].\n\nHis personal life was marked by bad fortune. He studied at the Lycée de Bruges and then at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris. After participating in the defense of Paris in 1814, he attended the [[École Polytechnique]] in 1815. Unfortunately that year's class was excluded in the following year by [[Louis XVIII]] because of their sympathy for [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Bonapartists]].\n\nIn 1818, he lectured on mathematics at the [[Saint-Cyr Military Academy|Académie militaire de Saint-Cyr]] but, two years later, he entered the Finance Ministry. He was rapidly promoted, first to inspector, then to inspector general. But the new Republican administration removed him in 1848 for his lack of support for the Republican regime.\n\nHe became professor of probability at the [[Sorbonne]], but he lost his position in 1851. He then became a consultant as an expert statistician for the government of [[Napoléon III]].\n\nIn 1852 he was admitted  to the [[Académie des sciences (France)|Académie des sciences]]. After 23 years, Bienaymé became the examiner for the attribution of the academy's prize in statistics. He was also a founding member of the [[Société Mathématique de France]], holding its presidency in 1875.\n\n==Contributions to mathematics==\nBienaymé published only 23 articles, half of which appeared in obscure conditions. His first works concerned demographics and [[Life table|actuarial tables]]. In particular he studied the extinction of closed families (aristocratic families for instance) which declined even as the general population was growing.\n\nAs a disciple of Laplace and under the influence of Laplace's ''Théorie analytique des probabilités'' (1812), he defended the latter's conceptions in a debate with [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]] on the size of [[juries]] and on the necessary majority for obtaining a conviction.\n\nHe translated into French the works of his friend the [[Russia]]n mathematician [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]], and published the [[Bienaymé–Chebyshev inequality]] which gives a simple demonstration of the [[law of large numbers]]. He corresponded with [[Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quételet|Quételet]], and also had links with [[Gabriel Lamé|Lamé]].\n\nBienaymé criticized Poisson's \"law of large numbers\" and was involved in a controversy with [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]].  Both Bienaymè and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] published regression methods at about the same time.  Bienaymé had generalized the [[Ordinary Least Squares|method of ordinary least squares.]]  The dispute within the literature was over the superiority of one method over the other.  It is now known that [[ordinary least squares]] is the [[Gauss–Markov theorem|best linear unbiased estimator]] provided errors are [[uncorrelated]] and [[Homoscedasticity|homoscedastic]].  At the time, this was not known.  [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] developed the [[Cauchy distribution]] to show a case where the method of [[ordinary least squares]] resulted in a  perfectly [[Efficiency (statistics)|inefficient]] [[estimator]].  This is due to the fact that the [[Cauchy distribution]] has no defined variance to minimize.  This is the first direct appearance of  the [[Cauchy distribution]] in the academic literature.  The curve had been previously studied by others, though in the English language as the [[Witch of Agnesi]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Stigler | first1 = S.
