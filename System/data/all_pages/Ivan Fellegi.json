He arrived in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], that year and soon began working for [[Statistics Canada]] (then known as the [[Dominion Bureau of Statistics]]), which is widely regarded as one of the best statistical agencies in the world.\n\nHe completed his studies with night courses at [[Carleton University]]. In 1958 he was the first Carleton University student to receive a [[Master's degree|Master of Science]] degree. Upon completing his doctoral studies in mathematical statistics in 1961 he became Carleton's first [[Ph.D.]] graduate.\n\nIn 1961 he was appointed Director of Sampling Research and Consultation staff, and Director General of the Methodology and systems Branch in 1971. He was promoted to Assistant Chief Statistician in 1973, and became Deputy Chief Statistician in 1984. On September 1, 1985, with close to 30 years experience, Ivan Fellegi was appointed [[Chief Statistician of Canada]].  He announced his retirement as Chief Statistician on February 15, 2008.\n\nIn 1992, he was made a Member of the [[Order of Canada]] and was promoted to Officer in 1998. He is an honorary member of the [[International Statistical Institute]] and an honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society]]. He provided advice on statistical matters to his native Hungary following its transition to democracy, and in 2004 he was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary]].\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.statcan.ca/english/kits/issues/issue6.htm A newspaper profile from the Statistics Canada website]\n* [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/goodprac/bpform.asp?DocId=190&KeyId=25 Characteristics of an Effective Statistical System]\n* [http://alumni.carleton.ca/alumni/greatgrads_profile.cfm?gradid=151 Carleton University Alumni]\n* [http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=210f44d8-7cf2-48c2-941c-7bc9a738df99 Ottawa Citizen, February 16, 2008:  A few less surveys, a few more poems]\n*[http://www.utpress.utoronto.ca/cgi-bin/cw2w3.cgi?p=faucher&t=48660&d=1661 Canadian Who's Who 1997]\n* {{cite book | author=Statistics Canada | title=75 Years and Counting: A History of Statistics Canada| location=Ottawa | publisher=Minister Responsible for Statistics Canada| year=1993 |id=(Statistics Canada Catalogue no. 11-531)}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Fellegi, Ivan\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = June 22, 1935\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Szeged]], [[Hungary]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fellegi, Ivan}}\n[[Category:1935 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Canadian civil servants]]\n[[Category:Hungarian emigrants to Canada]]\n[[Category:Officers of the Order of Canada]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Canadian statisticians]]\n[[Category:Hungarian statisticians]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Hungarian descent]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Statistical Society of Canada]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the International Statistical Institute]]\n[[Category:Carleton University alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Szeged]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Ivan Fellegi"}}}}
