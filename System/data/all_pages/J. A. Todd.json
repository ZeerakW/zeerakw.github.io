He did research under [[H.F. Baker]], and in 1931 took a position at the [[University of Manchester]]. He became a lecturer at Cambridge in 1937.

It used the methods of the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. The [[Todd–Coxeter process]] for [[coset enumeration]] is a major method of computational algebra, and dates from a collaboration with [[H.S.M. Coxeter]] in 1936. In 1953 he and Coxeter discovered the [[Coxeter–Todd lattice]]. In 1954 he and G. C. Shephard classified the finite [[complex reflection group]]s.\n\n==Honours==\nIn March 1948 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=2&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27todd%27%29 |title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher= Royal Society| accessdate= 28 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Todd.html Todd's Mactutor biography]\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata\n|NAME= Todd, John Arthur\n|ALTERNATIVE NAMES=\n|SHORT DESCRIPTION= [[England|English]] [[Mathematician]] \t \n|DATE OF BIRTH= 23 August 1908 \t \n|PLACE OF BIRTH= [[Liverpool]], [[England]] \t \n|DATE OF DEATH= 22 December 1994 \t \n|PLACE OF DEATH= [[Croydon]], [[England]] \t \n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Todd, J.
