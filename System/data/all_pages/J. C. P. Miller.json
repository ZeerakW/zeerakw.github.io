He worked in [[number theory]] and on [[geometry]], particularly [[polyhedra]], where '''Miller's monster''' refers to the [[great dirhombicosidodecahedron]].\n\nHe was an early member of the Computing Laboratory of the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/conference/EDSAC99/history.html A brief informal history of the Computer Laboratory]</ref> He contributed in computation to the construction and documentation of [[mathematical tables]],<ref>A. Fletcher, J. C. P. Miller and L. Rosenhead, ''An index of mathematical tables''; this work is mentioned in Diana H. Hook, Jeremy M. Norman, Michael R. Williams, ''Origins of Cyberspace: A Library on the History of Computing, Networking, and Telecommunications'' (2002), p. 362, as compiled in 1943, and remaining useful until the 1960s.</ref> and by the proposal of certain [[algorithm]]s. Miller's recurrence algorithm is mentioned in the ''[[Abramowitz and Stegun|Handbook of Mathematical Functions]]''.<ref>Milton Abramowitz, Irene A. Stegun, ''Handbook of Mathematical Functions: With Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables'' (1965), p. xiii.</ref>\n\n{{cquote| What Miller perceived was that in a second-order linear recurrence which has solutions sufficiently differentiated asymptotically, there is a solution that may be uniquely characterized by one initial value and a knowledge of its growth. This led to an algorithm for computing certain solutions of the equation which required only a scant knowledge of their pointwise values.<ref>[http://booklists.narod.ru/M_Mathematics/MN_Numerical_methods/Wimp_J._Computation_with_recurrence_relations__Pitman__1984__L__T__ISBN_0273085085__162s_.1.htm  ''Wimp J. Computation with recurrence relations'']</ref>}}\n\nAs the reference says, this technique was subsequently much developed and applied, and was enunciated rather casually by Miller in a 1952 book of tables of [[Bessel function]]s.\n\nIn volume 2 of ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'', [[Donald Knuth]] attributes to Miller a basic technique on [[formal power series]], for recursive evaluation of coefficients of powers or more general functions.<ref>P. 507 of the second edition.</ref>\n\nIn the theory of [[stellation]] of polyhedra, he made some influential suggestions to [[H. S. M. Coxeter]]. These became known as ''Miller's rules''. The 1938 book  on [[the fifty-nine icosahedra]] resulted, written by Coxeter and [[Patrick du Val]].<ref>[http://www.steelpillow.com/polyhedra/StelFacet/history.html ''Stellation and facetting - a brief history'']</ref> In the 1930s, Coxeter and Miller found 12 new [[uniform polyhedra]], a step in the process of their complete classification in the 1950s.<ref>Peter R. Cromwell, ''Polyhedra: \"One of the Most Charming Chapters of Geometry\"'' (1999), p. 178.</ref> Miller also made an early investigation into what is now known as the [[Rule 90]] [[cellular automaton]].<ref>{{citation|first=J.
