During his studies he joined the [[social democratic]] [[Menshevik Party]], becoming a member of the Menshevik International Caucus. In 1918 he was the labor minister in the [[Terek Soviet Republic]]. In 1919 he emigrated to [[Germany]], where he studied at the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]].\n\nIn 1922–1926 he was a journalist, and in 1928 he joined the new [[Kiel]] ''[[Institut für Weltwirtschaft]]''. Since he could not become a full professor because of his Jewish origin, he emigrated again to [[England]], where he went to [[Oxford]] to teach at the Oxford Institute of Statistics, which was funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], allowing him to emigrate in 1940 to the [[USA]]. After teaching at the [[New School for Social Research]], in 1943 he went to [[University of Chicago]], where he led the [[Cowles Commission]]. He followed the Commission's move to [[Yale University]], then became [[emeritus]] at [[UCLA]].\n\nIn 1972 he co-founded [[Team Theory]] with [[Roy Radner]].\n\nMarschak was fluent in approximately one dozen languages.  Shortly before he was due to become president of the [[American Economic Association]], he died from a stroke.\n\nUCLA sponsors the recurring [http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/x1094.xml Jacob Marschak
