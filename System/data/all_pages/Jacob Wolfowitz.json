Shannon Award|Shannon Award]]-winning [[information theory|information theorist]].  He was the father of former [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]] and [[World Bank Group]] President [[Paul Wolfowitz]].\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] in 1910, he emigrated with his parents to the [[United States]] in 1920. In the mid-1930s, Wolfowitz began his career as high school mathematics teacher and continued teaching until 1942 when he received his Ph.D. degree in [[mathematics]] from [[New York University]]. While a part-time graduate student, Wolfowitz met [[Abraham Wald]], with whom he collaborated in numerous joint papers in the field of [[mathematical statistics]].  This collaboration continued until Wald's death in an airplane crash in 1950.  In 1951, Wolfowitz became a [[professor]] of mathematics at [[Cornell University]], where he stayed until 1970. From 1970 to 1978 he was at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. He died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Tampa]], [[Florida]], where he had become a professor at the [[University of South Florida]] after retiring from Illinois.\n\nWolfowitz's main contributions were in the fields of [[decision theory|statistical decision theory]],  [[non-parametric statistics]], [[sequential analysis]], and [[information theory]].\n\nOne of his results is the strong converse to Claude Shannon's coding theorem. While Shannon could prove only that the block error probability can not become arbitrarily small if the transmission rate is above the channel capacity, Wolfowitz proved that the block error rate actually converges to one. As a consequence, Shannon's original result is today termed \"the weak theorem\" (sometimes also Shannon's \"conjecture\" by some authors).\n\n==References==\n* [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer, J.]], ed.
