Originally named Jacob, he changed the spelling. He was a brother of [[Henrik Mohn|Henrik]] and [[Emanuel Mohn]]. On the maternal side, he was a grandson of bishop [[Jacob Neumann]]. In July 1866 he married Valeria Paasche (1843–1912). He was a granduncle of [[Frank Mohn|Frank]] and [[Albert Henrik Mohn]],<ref name=nbl>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2003|title=Jakob Mohn|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Einar|last=Lie|volume=6|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Jakob_Mohn/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=5 April 2009}}</ref> and since his daughter Hanna married physician and politician [[Nils Yngvar Ustvedt]], Mohn was a grandfather of [[Hans Jacob Ustvedt]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ustvedt, Nils Yngvar|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|edition=1st|year=1975|volume=14|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|editor=Jansen, Jonas; Anker, Øyvind|first=Carl Birger|last=van der Hagen|pages=430–432|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education at [[Bergen Cathedral School]] in 1855, and graduated from the [[University of Oslo|Royal Fredercik University]] with the [[cand.jur.]] degree already in 1859. He was soon hired in the Statistics Office, and together with [[Anders Nicolai Kiær]] he led its transition into an independent research directorate, renamed [[Statistics Norway|''Det statistiske Centralbureau'']] in 1876. Norway as a country implemented the use of large, quantitative statistics in politics quite early. The initiator was the priest and researcher [[Eilert Sundt]], and Mohn. Mohn was also involved in the workers' society [[Kristiania Arbeidersamfund|Christiania Arbeidersamfund]], and through his research on [[child labour]] among other things, he capacitated social reform. His last work was ''Norges Land og Folk'', requisitioned by the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] in 1874, and meant to be a grand reference work. However, he never finished a single volume, as he died in February 1882 in [[Oslo|Kristiania]]. His work was carried on by Anders Nicolai Kiær and [[Boye Strøm]].<ref name=nbl/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Mohn, Jakob\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Norwegian statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 31 May 1838\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 16 February 1882\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mohn, Jakob}}\n[[Category:1838 births]]\n[[Category:1882 deaths]]\n[[Category:Norwegian statisticians]]\n[[Category:University of Oslo alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Bergen]]\n[[Category:People educated at the Bergen Cathedral School]]\n\n{{Norway-scientist-stub}}\n{{europe-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Jakob Mohn"}}}}
