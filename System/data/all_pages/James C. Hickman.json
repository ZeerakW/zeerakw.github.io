His father (also named James C. Hickman) owned a small shop on the town's square. Hickman went to [[Simpson College]] where he earned his [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[mathematics]] with an emphasis in [[actuarial science]] in 1950. From there he went on to the [[University of Iowa]] to get his [[Master's degree]] in [[Mathematical statistics]] in 1952. He earned a [[Doctorate]] in 1961 from the [[University of Iowa]].\n\nIn 1952 Hickman married his wife Margaret, with whom he had three children, Charles, Don and Barbara. He loved the outdoors and completed a number of bicycle tours through [[Nova Scotia]], [[Colorado]], [[Alaska]] and [[California]].

During this time he was working in their [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]] department and was named a full professor in 1967. He left [[University of Iowa|UI]] after only five years as a full professor, and in 1972 he went to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].

He was dean until 1990 and left the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] faculty in 1993.\n\nIn 2006, then UW Business School Dean Michael Knetter said, \"While research and academic work was Jim's passion, he also provided great leadership for the School of Business at a critical period when our alumni became more engaged and supportive of our efforts.\"  He went on to say, \"As dean, Jim was instrumental in the effort to develop, design and build Grainger Hall. He was a great role model for many of us and will be missed by the entire community.\"\n\nWhile serving as dean Hickman raised $40 million in support of a new building, Granger Hall which was named after businessman David Grainger.
