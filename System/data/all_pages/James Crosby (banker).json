Moore had predicted that HBOS's rapid growth left it vulnerable to a large number of borrower [[default (finance)|default]]s.

The FSA released a statement late on 11 February 2009 that it had concerns about HBOS before the Moore resignation, a statement which raises yet more questions about the regulation of HBOS. A central problem concerns [[conflict of interest]]s between board members of the FSA and the companies it is trying to regulate. However, Moore has received support from a former member of his team at HBOS, Anthony Smith, who on 17 February 2009, accused HBOS of \"dumbing down\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Reuben |first=Anthony |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7892079.stm |title=Business &#124; HBOS risk control 'dumbed down' |publisher=BBC News |date= 2009-02-17|accessdate=2009-02-18}}</ref>\nCrosby was further criticised when, following the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds, HBOS was responsible for annual losses of £10 billion, in part due to write-downs made because Lloyds' accounting standards are much more conservative than those of HBOS.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Peston |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2009/02/lloyds_and_hbos_humbled.html |title=Robert Peston &#124; Lloyds and HBOS Humbled |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2009-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/lloyds-warns-of-16310bn-loss-at-hbos-after-hefty-writeoffs-1609252.html |title=£10billion loss |publisher=The Independent |date=2009-02-14 |accessdate=2009-02-18 | location=London | first=Sarah | last=Arnott}}</ref> Conservative Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said that the government's bank bailout money had been wiped out by the HBOS losses, saying that \"HBOS bankers like James Crosby bear a heavy responsibility\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article5728797.ece |title=The Times Online &#124; Crosby |publisher=Business.timesonline.co.uk |date= 2009-02-14|accessdate=2009-02-18 | location=London | first1=Patrick | last1=Hosking | first2=Philip | last2=Webster}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/politics/Shares-plunge-puts-Lloyds-39on.4980753.jp |title=Scotsman &#124; Sharles plunge |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= 2009-02-14|accessdate=2009-02-18 |location=Edinburgh |first=Gerri |last=Peev}}</ref>\n\n==Links with HM Treasury==\nOn 11 July 2006, Crosby was appointed by the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Gordon Brown]], to lead the Government's Public Private Forum on Identity Management, a scheme designed to counter problems such as [[identity fraud]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_51_06.htm |title=Chancellor appoints Sir James Crosby to lead Public Private Forum on Identity |publisher=HM Treasury |date=2006-07-11 |accessdate=2009-02-18}}</ref> Also in 2006, Crosby  received a [[knight bachelor|knighthood]] for services to the financial industry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5087482.stm |title=Business &#124; Easyjet founder Stelios knighted |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-06-16 |accessdate=2009-02-18}}</ref> \n\nIn April 2008, Crosby was appointed by [[Chancellor]] [[Alastair Darling]] to head up a Working Group of mortgage industry experts to advise the Government on how to improve the functioning of the [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] market.\n\n==Other roles==\nIn 2006, Crosby was appointed to lead Gordon Brown's Identity Assurance review.<ref>http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/identity_management/identity_management_index.cfm</ref>\n\nCrosby is a non-executive director of television company [[ITV plc|ITV]], and a trustee of charity [[Cancer Research UK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/news/archive/pressreleases/2008/january/402363 |title=Cancer Research UK : Sir James Crosby joins Cancer Research UK's Governing Council |publisher=Info.cancerresearchuk.org |date=2008-01-31 |accessdate=2009-02-18}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2009, it was reported that James Crosby would become the Chairman of [[Misys]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-1132752/Sir-James-Crosby-named-Misys-new-chairman.html |title=Sir James Crosby named as Misys' new chairman &#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2009-02-18 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n== Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards==\nOn 3 December 2012 Crosby was required to appear before the British Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards over his role as Chief Executive during the Collapse of HBOS. Britain's ''Daily Mail'' reported:\n\n<blockquote>Crosby, chief executive of Halifax Bank of Scotland from 2001 to the Summer of 2006, said: 'I'm very sorry about what happened.'\nAsked what he was apologising for, he responded: 'I'm apologising for the fact that I played a major part in building a  business that failed.'\nHe added: 'I wasn't there for the last few years but it would be wrong to disassociate myself from what happened… I was horrified and deeply upset by what happened – it was hugely distressing to see what happened to shareholders, colleagues and taxpayers.'\nPat McFadden MP asked if Crosby understood the public's anger towards the former bosses at HBOS. He added: 'Is it fair that one knight is stripped of his knighthood and others carry on regardless?'\nCrosby said: 'I am in no doubt that my reputation and achievements will ever again be seen in the same light.'<ref>Daily Mail 4 December 2012</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritain's ''Financial Times'' reported:\n\n<blockquote>Sir James was evasive on whether he would consider giving up his knighthood, saying that it was a 'huge honour' at the time but added: 'I am in no doubt that my reputation and achievement will never again be seen in the same light.'\nFred Goodwin, former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, was stripped of his knighthood this year.\nThe former HBOS manager also said he did not think he would be granted permission to run a bank again. His successor Andy Hornby, who was at the helm of HBOS when it nearly collapsed in 2008, reiterated in a separate testimony at the commission his 'heartfelt apologies for what had happened at HBOS'.\nThe two former chief executives’ grilling came as Andy Haldane, the Bank of England’s executive director in charge of financial stability, said the impact of the banking crisis was 'as bad as a world war'.\n'If we are fortunate, the cost of the crisis will be paid for by our children. More likely it will still be being paid for by our grandchildren,' he told BBC Radio 4. 'There is every reason why the general public ought to be deeply upset by what has happened – and angry.'<ref>The Financial Times 4 December 2012</ref></blockquote>\n\n'Whitehall’s honours forfeiture committee met in recent days and accepted Mr Crosby’s request for him to lose his knighthood.' <ref>The Telegraph 11 June 2013</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Andy Hornby]]\n*[[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Crosby, James\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = British businessman\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1956-03-14\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crosby, James}}\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople from Leeds]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:People educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]\n[[Category:British actuaries]]\n[[Category:English bankers]]\n[[Category:British businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n[[Category:People stripped of a British Commonwealth honour]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "James Crosby (banker)"}}}}
