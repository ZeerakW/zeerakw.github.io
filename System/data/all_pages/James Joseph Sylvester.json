He made fundamental contributions to [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix theory]], [[invariant theory]], [[number theory]], [[Integer partition|partition theory]] and [[combinatorics]].  He played a leadership role in American mathematics in the later half of the 19th century as a professor at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] and as founder of the [[American Journal of Mathematics]].  At his death, he was professor at [[Oxford University|Oxford]].\n\n== Biography ==\nSylvester was born '''James Joseph''' in London, England. His father, Abraham Joseph, was a merchant.  James adopted the surname '''Sylvester''' when his older brother did so upon emigration to the United States—a country which at that time required all immigrants to have a given name, a middle name, and a surname. At the age of 14, Sylvester was a student of [[Augustus De Morgan]] at the [[University of London]]. His family withdrew him from the University after he was accused of stabbing a fellow student with a knife. Subsequently he attended the [[Liverpool Royal Institution]].\n\nSylvester began his study of mathematics at [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1831,<ref name=\"ACAD\">{{acad|id=SLVR831JJ|name=Sylvester, James Joseph}}</ref> where his tutor was [[John Hymers]]. Although his studies were interrupted for almost two years due to a prolonged illness, he nevertheless ranked second in Cambridge's famous mathematical examination, the [[tripos]], for which he sat in 1837. However, Sylvester was not issued a degree, because graduates at that time were required to state their acceptance of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]], and Sylvester, being an adherent of [[Jewish|Judaism]], refused to do so. For the same reason, he was unable to compete for a Fellowship or obtain a [[Smith's prize]].<ref name=\"MenofMathematics\">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Men_of_Mathematics.html? | title=Men of Mathematics | publisher=Simon Schuster | author=Bell, Eric Temple | year=1986}}</ref> In 1838 Sylvester became professor of natural philosophy at [[University College London]]. In 1841, he was awarded a BA and an [[Master's degree|MA]] by [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. In the same year he moved to the United States to become a professor at the [[University of Virginia]] for about six months, and returned to England in November 1843.\n\nOn his return to England he studied law, alongside fellow British lawyer/mathematician [[Arthur Cayley]], with whom he made significant contributions to [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix theory]] while working as an [[actuary]].  One of his private pupils was [[Florence Nightingale]]. He did not obtain a position teaching university mathematics until 1855, when he was appointed professor of mathematics at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], from which he retired in 1869, because the compulsory retirement age was 55. The Woolwich academy initially refused to pay Sylvester his full pension, and only relented after a prolonged public controversy, during which Sylvester took his case to the letters page of ''[[The Times]]''.\n\nOne of Sylvester's lifelong passions was for poetry; he read and translated works from the original French, German, Italian, [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and many of his mathematical papers contain illustrative quotes from classical poetry. Following his early retirement, {{harvtxt|Sylvester|1870}} published a book entitled ''[[The Laws of Verse]]'' in which he attempted to codify a set of laws for [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]] in poetry.\n\nIn 1872, he finally received his B.A. and M.A. from Cambridge, having been denied the degrees due to him being a Jew.<ref name=\"ACAD\" />\n\nIn 1876<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Preliminary Outline of Instructions for the Session Beginning October 3, 1876|last = |first = |date = September 1876|journal = Johns Hopkins University.

His salary was $5,000 (quite generous for the time), which he demanded be paid in gold.  After negotiation, agreement was reached on a salary that was not paid in gold.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Pioneer: A History of the Johns Hopkins University, 1874-1889|last = Hawkins|first = Hugh|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 1960|isbn = |location = Ithaca, NY|pages = 41–43}}</ref>  In 1878 he founded the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]''.  The only other mathematical journal in the US at that time was the ''Analyst'', which eventually became the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''.\n\nIn 1883, he returned to England to take up the [[Savilian chair of geometry|Savilian Professor of Geometry]] at [[Oxford University]]. He held this chair until his death, although in 1892 the University appointed a deputy professor to the same chair.\n\nSylvester invented a great number of mathematical terms such as \"[[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]\",<ref>[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Matrices_and_determinants.html Matrices and determinants], The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive</ref> \"[[graph (mathematics)|graph]]\" (combinatorics)<ref>See:\n*  J.

In 1880, the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] awarded Sylvester the [[Copley Medal]], its highest award for scientific achievement; in 1901, it instituted the [[Sylvester Medal]] in his memory, to encourage mathematical research after his death in [[Oxford]]. In [[Discrete geometry]] he is remembered for [[Sylvester–Gallai theorem|Sylvester's Problem]] and a result on the [[orchard problem]].\n\nSylvester House, a portion of an undergraduate dormitory at [[Johns Hopkins University]], is named in his honor. Several professorships there are named in his honor also.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of things named after James Joseph Sylvester]]\n\n== Publications ==\n*{{Citation | last1=Sylvester | first1=James Joseph | title=The Laws of Verse Or Principles of Versification Exemplified in Metrical Translations: together with an annotated reprint of the inaugural presidential address to the mathematical and physical section of the British Association at Exeter | year=1870 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TxNIAAAAIAAJ | publisher=London: Longmans, Green and Co | isbn=978-1-177-91141-2}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Sylvester | first1=James Joseph | editor1-link=H.
