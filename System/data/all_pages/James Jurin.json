He was a staunch proponent of the work of Sir [[Isaac Newton]] and often used his gift for satire in Newton's defence.\n\n==Early life==\nJurin's father was John Jurin, a London [[Dyeing|dyer]]. His mother was John's wife Dorcas Cotesworth. He was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]] where he won a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating BA in 1705, and being elected [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellow]] the following year.<ref>{{acad|id=JRN702J|name=Jurin, James}}</ref> Becoming the ''protégé'' of the master of Trinity, [[Richard Bentley]], Jurin became tutor to [[Mordecai Cary]], travelling with him internationally. Jurin achieved his [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1709 and became [[headteacher]] of the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle]]. Jurin became a frequent public speaker on mathematics and the work of Sir [[Isaac Newton]].<ref name=\"ODNB\">Rusnock (2004)</ref> Jurin returned to [[Cambridge]] in 1715 to study medicine, becoming MD the following year and establishing a successful practice in London and [[Tunbridge Wells]]. In 1722, he lectured on [[anatomy]] to the [[Company of Surgeons]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> From 1725 to 1732 he worked as a physician at [[Guy's Hospital]], thereafter becoming a governor of the hospital. In 1724, Jurin married Mary Douglas, ''née'' Harris (died 1784), wealthy widow of [[Oley Douglas]], and they had five daughters and one son.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==Medical practice==\nJurin rose to a position of some eminence in medicine and science. He is described as \"witty, satirical, ambitious, and professionally and financially successful\".<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He was a powerful advocate of the smallpox [[variolation]], a procedure involving scratching pus or material from the scabs of smallpox sores into the veins of a non-immune person to create a mild case of the disease that would confer lifelong immunity.  Jurin used an early statistical study to compare the [[risk]]s of variolation with those from contracting the disease naturally. He studied [[Death|mortality]] statistics for London for the fourteen years prior to 1723 and concluded that one fourteenth of the population had died from smallpox, up to 40 percent during epidemics.<ref name=\"porter\">Porter (1997) ''p.''275</ref> He advertised in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]'' for readers to report their personal and professional experiences and received over sixty replies, most from other physicians or surgeons<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> but most significantly from [[Thomas Nettleton]] who reported his own calculations from his experience in several communities in [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=\"porter\"/> Jurin's analysis concluded that the [[probability]] of death from variolation was roughly 1 in 50, while the probability of death from naturally contracted smallpox was 1 in 7 or 8. He published his results in a series of annual pamphlets, ''An Account of the Success of Inoculating the Small-Pox'' (1723–1727). His work was very influential in establishing smallpox variolation in England some seventy years before Edward Jenner introduced the more effective method of \"vaccination\" using cowpox material in place of human smallpox.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Jurin claimed that he had given \"plain Proof from Experience and Matters of Fact that the Small Pox procured by inoculation ... is far less Dangerous than the same Distemper has been for many Years in the Natural Way.\"<ref name=\"porter\"/>\n\n==Newtonian scientist==\nJurin was an \"ardent Newtonian\". He had studied under [[Roger Cotes]] and [[William Whiston]] at Cambridge but only came to know Newton at the [[Royal Society]], where Jurin was Secretary towards the end of Newton's [[President of the Royal Society|Presidency]]. Always advocating the Newtonian position, he was a keen controversialist, corresponding with [[Voltaire]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] and [[Émilie du Châtelet]]. He took an active part in defending Newton and attacking [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in [[Conservation of Energy#History|the debate over ''vis viva'']],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> opposing the views of [[Benjamin Robins]] and [[Pietro Antonio Michelotti]].<ref name=\"munk\">Munk (1878)</ref> Jurin fostered international observational research into weather and [[meteorology]]<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and studied the phenomenon of [[capillary action]], deriving the rule that the height of liquid in a capillary tube is inversely proportional to the [[diameter]] of the tube at the surface of the liquid only, a law sometimes known as [[Jurin's law]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Jurin rule | work=McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms | year=2003 | publisher=McGraw-Hill on Answers.com | accessdate=5 September 2007 | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/jurin-rule?cat=technology }}</ref><ref>Jurin (1717/ 1719)</ref> He published on [[hydrodynamics]] and was critical of [[Jean Bernoulli|Jean]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s work.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Jurin worked on [[iatrophysics]], investigating the mechanical behaviour of the [[heart]] and the [[specific gravity]] of blood, debating the heart with [[James Keill]] and [[Jean-Baptiste de Sénac]]. He wrote an addendum (1738) ''On Distinct and Indistinct Vision'' to [[Robert Smith (mathematician)|Robert Smith]]'s ''Opticks'' and engaged in a lively epistollary exchange with Robins on the topic.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==Controversy with Berkeley==\nIn 1734, [[George Berkeley]] published ''[[The Analyst]]'' in which he attacked the [[calculus]] as flawed and ultimately absurd. Between 1734 and 1742, Jurin published over three hundred pages in robust rebuttal of Berkeley, many of them employing his favourite weapon of satire. The publications, some under the pseudonym ''Philalethes Cantabrigensis'', included ''Geometry no Friend to Infidelity'', or ''A Defence of Sir Isaac Newton & the British Mathematicians'' (1734)<ref name=\"defence\">{{cite web | title=Geometry No Friend to Infidelity | work=The 'Analyst' Controversy | publisher=D.

Jurin had used a similar prescription for himself but Walpole died and Jurin was blamed for his death, again necessitating an energetic pamphlet campaign to defend his practice.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Jurin died in London and was buried at [[St James Garlickhythe]]. His [[estate (law)|estate]] was valued at £35,000 (£4.9 million at 2003 prices<ref>{{cite journal | title=Consumer Price Inflation since 1750 | author=O'Donoghue, J.| journal=Economic Trends | volume=604 | year=2004 | pages=38–46, March | url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/article.asp?ID=726 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>)\n.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==Offices and honours==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n!
