Vaupel''' (born May 2, 1945), is an American scientist in the fields of [[aging research]], [[biodemography]], and formal [[demography]]. He has been instrumental in developing and advancing the idea of the plasticity of [[longevity]], and pioneered research on the heterogeneity of mortality risks and on the deceleration of [[death rates]] at the highest ages.<ref name=pmid12004104>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1069675 |title=DEMOGRAPHY: Enhanced: Broken Limits to Life Expectancy |year=2002 |last1=Oeppen |first1=J. |journal=Science |volume=296 |issue=5570 |pages=1029–31 |pmid=12004104 |last2=Vaupel |first2=JW}}{{psc|date=October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.855 |title=Biodemographic Trajectories of Longevity |year=1998 |last1=Vaupel |first1=J.

He is also a research professor at [[Duke University]] and the director of its Population, Policy, Aging and Research Center.  Vaupel is a member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]], a regular scientific member of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] and fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=bio>{{cite web | url = http://user.demogr.mpg.de/jwv | title = Prof. Dr. James W.

In 2001 he was awarded by the Population Association of America the Irene B. Taeuber Award for his lifetime research achievements.<ref>{{cite web | title = Irene B.Taeuber Awardees | url = http://www.popassoc.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3306 | publisher = Population Association of America}}</ref> In 2008 he received the Mindel C.

Vaupel’s research shows that life expectancy is likely to increase well beyond the purported limit of 85 years.<ref>{{cite news | title = Hell No, We Won't Go!

Jay Olshansky]] have had a disagreement about what this means in terms of future projections of the human life span.<ref>{{cite magazine | title = Staying Alive | magazine = Discover | section = Health & Medicine / Aging | url = http://discovermagazine.com/2003/nov/cover | first = Karen | last = Wright | date = November 2003}}</ref> \n\nVaupel’s work also focuses on the nascent field of evolutionary demography.  His research activities here strive to understand age-specific mortality in terms of the evolutionary processes that shape it.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=3401355 |pages=258–269 |last1=Vaupel |first1=J.
