Hoem''' (born 17 April 1939) is a distinguished scientist in population studies.\n\nHe was born in [[Kristiansund]], [[Norway]], studied [[actuarial science]] and [[mathematical statistics]] in [[Oslo]], and was awarded a [[Dr.philos.]] in 1969.  He became a lecturer at the [[University of Oslo]] and later moved on to found and head the Socio-Demographic Research Unit at [[Statistics Norway]].  From 1974 to 1981 he was Professor at the Laboratory of Insurance Mathematics at the [[University of Copenhagen]], followed by a professorship in [[Demometry]] at [[Stockholm University]].  In 1999 he was appointed Director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]] in [[Rostock]], [[Germany]], a position he held until he retired in 2007.<ref>[http://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/staff/hoem/default.htm Jan Hoem's Homepage at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]</ref> Currently he is working as Professor Emeritus at the Stockholm University Demography Unit<ref>[http://people.su.se/~jhoem/ Jan Hoem's Homepage at the Stockholm University Demography Unit]</ref>\n\nBefore he took his Dr.philos degree, he published a book called “Basic Concepts of Formal Demography”,<ref>Oslo University Press (1967)</ref> which became the standard introductory text in demography in Norway. His article on [[Markov chain]] models <ref>Markov Chain Models in life insurance, ''Blätter Deutsch. Gesellsch.Versich.math.'' [http://www.springerlink.com/content/273515345614634w/fulltext.pdf]</ref> has been named one of the four most significant papers in modern actuarial science. Hoem also made contributions to stochastic stable population theory,<ref>Stochastic stable population theory with continuous time,(with Niels Keiding). ''Scand. Act. J''. 1976 (3), 150-175 (1976)</ref> demographic incidence rates,<ref>Demographic incidence rates. ''Theor. Popul. Biol''. 14 (3), 329-337. Bibliographic Note, 18 (2), 195 (1978)</ref> and the statistical analysis of multiplicative models. He is best known for his work on event-history analysis - contributions that have helped shape demographic methodology.<ref>Purged and Partial Markov chains.''Scand. Act.

In his papers on the impact of social policies on fertility, Hoem showed that the stringent application of appropriate methods to individual-level data greatly improve our understanding of the link between public policies, demographic behavior, and demographic outcomes.<ref>Public policy as the fuel of fertility: effects of a policy reform on the pace of childbearing in Sweden in the 1980s\".

''Population and Development Review'' 16 (4), 735-748 (1990)</ref>\n\nIn 2006 he was awarded the IUSSP [[Laureate]] [[Award]] in recognition of his achievements in scientific research.<ref>[http://www.iussp.org/Awards/12-hoem.php IUSSP Laureate Award]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/default_rframe.htm Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]\n*[http://user.demogr.mpg.de/hoem/03.htm Publications by Jan Hoem]\n*[http://www.suda.su.se/ Stockholm University Demography Unit]\n*[http://www.iussp.org/ Webpage of IUSSP]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n|NAME=Hoem, Jan\n|ALTERNATIVE NAMES=\n|SHORT DESCRIPTION=Scientist in population studies\n|DATE OF BIRTH=17 April 1939\n|PLACE OF BIRTH=[[Kristiansund]], [[Norway]]\n|DATE OF DEATH=\n|PLACE OF DEATH=\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hoem, Jan}}\n[[Category:1939 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Norwegian demographers]]\n[[Category:University of Oslo faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Copenhagen faculty]]\n[[Category:Stockholm University academics]]\n[[Category:Norwegian expatriates in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Norwegian expatriates in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Norwegian expatriates in Germany]]\n[[Category:People from Kristiansund]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Jan Hoem"}}}}
