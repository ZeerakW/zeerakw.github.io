The family was well off and later Jarl Waldemar would prefer to be a reader than a full professor. Lindeberg's career centred on the [[University of Helsinki]]. His early interests were in [[partial differential equation]]s and the [[calculus of variations]] but from 1920 he worked in [[probability]] and [[statistics]]. In 1920 he published his first paper on the [[central limit theorem]]. His result was similar to that obtained earlier by [[Aleksandr Lyapunov|Lyapunov]] whose work he did not then know. However, their approaches were quite different; Lindeberg's was based on a [[convolution]] argument while Lyapunov used the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]]. Two years later Lindeberg used his method to obtain a stronger result: the so-called ''[[Central limit theorem#Lindeberg condition|Lindeberg condition]]''. His work on probability led to him becoming involved in applied fields. He developed what we know as [[Kendall's tau]] and he found the first two moments of its sampling distribution. Lindeberg used [[line transect method]]s in [[forestry]], and when in 1926 determining the necessary number of transects to obtain a sufficiently precise [[confidence interval]], he seems to have rediscovered [[Student's t-distribution]].\n\nThe Swedish mathematician [[Harald Cramér]] met Lindeberg in 1922. He later recalled this story about Lindeberg and the beautiful farm he owned. \"When he was reproached for not being sufficiently active in his scientific work, he said 'Well, I am really a farmer.' And if somebody happened to say that his farm was not properly cultivated, his answer was 'Of course my real job is to be a professor.'  I was very fond of him and saw him often during the following years.\"\n\nLindeberg's work wasn't known by [[Alan Turing]], who proved the central limit theorem in his disseration in 1935.<ref>See Section 3 of John Aldrich, \"England and Continental Probability in the Inter-War Years\", Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique, vol. 5/2 [http://www.jehps.net/decembre2009.html Decembre 2009] Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique</ref>\n\n==Writing available on the web==\n*J.
