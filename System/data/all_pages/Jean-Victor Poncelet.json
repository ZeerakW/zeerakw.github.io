He is considered a reviver of [[projective geometry]], and his work ''Traité des propriétés projectives des figures'' is considered the first definitive text on the subject since [[Gérard Desargues]]' work on it in the 17th century. He later wrote an introduction to it; ''Applications d’analyse et de géométrie''.<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Jean-Victor Poncelet|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469548/Jean-Victor-Poncelet|accessdate=2008-04-19|year=2008|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc}}</ref>\n\nAs a mathematician, his most notable work was in [[projective geometry]]<!-- That has already been said, basically -->, although an early collaboration with [[Charles Julien Brianchon]] provided a significant contribution to [[Feuerbach's theorem]]. He also made discoveries about [[projective harmonic conjugates]]; relating these to the poles and polar lines associated with [[conic section]]s. He developed the concept of parallel lines meeting at a [[point at infinity]] and defined the [[circular points at infinity]] that are on every circle of the plane. These discoveries led to the [[duality (projective geometry)|principle of duality]], and the [[principle of continuity]] and also aided in the development of [[complex number]]s.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nAs a military engineer, he served in [[Napoleon]]'s campaign against the [[Russian Empire]] in 1812, in which he was captured and held prisoner until 1814. Later, he served as a [[professor]] of [[mechanics]] at the École d’application in his home town of [[Metz]], during which time he published ''Introduction à la mécanique industrielle'', a work he is famous for, and improved the design of [[turbine]]s and [[water wheel]]s. After this, he served as professor at the [[Faculté des Sciences de Paris|Faculté des Sciences]] at the [[University of Paris]], and finally as the commandant general of his ''alma mater'', the École polytechnique.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> He is honoured by having his name listed among notable French engineers and scientists displayed around the first stage of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|Eiffel tower]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Birth, education, and capture (1788–1814)===\n[[File:Cloître sainte Constance (lycée Fabert de Metz).JPG|thumb|left|The Fabert School in [[Metz]], where Poncelet was fellow student.]] \nPoncelet was born in [[Metz]], France, on July 1, 1788, the [[Legitimacy (law)|illegitimate]] then legitimated <ref>Poncelet was legitimated by his father in 1825 (from ''Baptism certificate'' — Archives Municipales of Metz).

Poncelet, however, could not publish it until after his release in 1814.<ref name=\"brit1911\">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Jean-Victor Poncelet|accessdate=2008-04-19|year=1911|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|volume=22|page=59}}</ref>\n\n===Release and later employment (1822–1848)===\nIn 1815, the year after his release, Poncelet was employed a military engineer at his hometown of Metz. In 1822, while at this position, he published ''Traité des propriétés projectives des figures''. This work was the first major to discuss projective geometry since Desargues', though [[Gaspard Monge]] had written a few minor works about it previously. It is considered the founding work of modern projective geometry.<ref name=\"mactutor\"/> [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne]] also wrote about this branch of geometry at approximately the same time, beginning in 1810. Poncelet published several papers about the subject in Gergonne's mathematical [[scientific journal|journal]] ''Annales de Gergonne'' (officially known as ''Annales de mathématiques pures et appliquées'').<ref name=\"brit1911\"/> However, Poncelet and Gergonne ultimately engaged in a bitter priority dispute over the Principle of Duality.<ref name=\"mactutor\" />\n\nIn 1825, he became the professor of [[mechanics]] at the École d'Application in Metz, a position he held until 1835. During his tenure at this school, he improved the design of [[turbine]]s and [[water wheel]]s, deriving his work from the mechanics of the [[Provence|Provençal]] mill from southern France.<ref>{{cite web|author=James B.
