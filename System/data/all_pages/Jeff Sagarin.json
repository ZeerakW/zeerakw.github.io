His ratings have been a regular feature in the [[USA Today]] sports section since 1985,<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/sagarin.htm USA Today Jeff Sagarin's page]</ref> have been used by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Tournament Selection Committee to help determine the participants in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] tournament since 1984,<ref>[http://www.bepress.com/jqas/vol4/iss2/8/ West, Brady T. (2008) \"A Simple and Flexible Rating Method for Predicting Success in the NCAA Basketball Tournament: Updated Results from 2007,\" Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports: Vol. 4 : Iss. 2, Article 8. {{doi|10.2202/1559-0410.1099}} (Sec. 2.2)]</ref> and were part of the [[college football]] [[Bowl Championship Series]] throughout its history from 1998 to 2014.<ref>[http://www.bcsfootball.org/news/story?id=4819686 Official BCS Website: Standings]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSagarin earned a  [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[mathematics]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1970.<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/12999/?a=f Computing Athletics - Technology Review]. ''technologyreview''. Retrieved July 21, 2011.</ref> He grew up outside [[New York City]] in [[Westchester County]] in [[New Rochelle, New York]].  In 1977 he moved to [[Bloomington, Indiana]].\n\n==Method==\nSagarin, like the developers of many other [[sports rating system]]s, does not divulge the exact methods behind his system.  He offers two rating systems, each of which gives each team a certain number of points.  One system, \"Elo chess,\" is presumably based on the [[Elo rating system]] used internationally to rank chess players.  This system uses only wins and losses with no reference to the victory margin.  The other system, \"Predictor,\" takes victory margin into account.  For that system the difference in two teams' rating scores is meant to predict the margin of victory for the stronger team at a neutral venue.  For both systems teams gain higher ratings within the Sagarin system by winning games against stronger opponents, factoring in such things as home-venue advantage.  For the Predictor system, margin of victory (or defeat) factors in also, but a [[Diminishing returns|law of diminishing returns]] is applied. Therefore, a [[American football|football]] team that wins a game by a margin of 7-6 is rewarded less than a team that defeats the same opponent under the same circumstances 21-7, but a team that wins a game by a margin of 35-0 receives similar ratings to a team that defeats the same opponent 70-0. This characteristic has the effect of recognizing \"comfortable\" victories, while limiting the reward for running up the score.\n\nAt the beginning of a season, when only a few games have been played, a [[Bayesian network]] weighted by starting rankings is used as long as there are whole groups of teams that have not played one another, but once the [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] is well-connected, the weights are no longer needed.  Sagarin claims that from that point, the rankings are unbiased. [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/sagarin/bkt0809.htm]\n\n==Justification==\nSagarin's ratings are particularly relevant in the world of [[United States|American]] college [[American football|football]] and [[basketball]], where, with hundreds of teams in [[NCAA Division I]] competition, there is no way a team can play against more than a small fraction of its competitors. Therefore, in determining the participants in championship games and tournaments, it is necessary to distinguish between teams that have compiled impressive win-loss records against strong competition and teams that have defeated weaker opponents. \n\nIn addition, sports rating systems are generally of great interest to [[gambler]]s.  Gamblers use Sagarin's ratings as a source of \"Power Rankings,\" traditionally used as a way to determine the spread between two teams.\n\n==Winval==\nAlong with his former [[MIT]] classmate Wayne L. Winston, a professor of decision sciences at [[Indiana University]], Sagarin advises the [[Dallas Mavericks]] about which lineups to use during games and which free agents to sign using a system called Winval.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E1DD123DF934A15757C0A9659C8B63 Leonhardt, David (2003, April 27).
