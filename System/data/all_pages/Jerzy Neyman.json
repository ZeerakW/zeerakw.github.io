Neyman first introduced the modern concept of a [[confidence interval]] into [[statistical hypothesis testing]]<ref name=\"tea\">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9Q0EDh43cxYC&pg=PA123&dq=Confidence+interval+Neyman&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5RpCUauFJabgyQG15ICoAg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Confidence%20interval%20Neyman&f=false | title=The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century | publisher=Macmillan | author=Salsburg, David | year=2002 | pages=122 | isbn=9780805071344}}</ref> and co-devised [[null hypothesis]] testing (in collaboration with [[Egon Pearson]]).\n\n==Life and career==\nHe was born into a [[Poles|Polish]] family in [[Bendery]], [[Bessarabia Governorate|Bessarabia]] in [[Imperial Russia]], the fourth of four children of Czesław Spława-Neyman and Kazimiera Lutosławska. His family was [[Roman Catholic]] and Neyman served as an altar boy during his early childhood. Later, Neyman would become an agnostic. Neyman's family descended from a long line of Polish nobles and military heroes. He graduated from the [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kamieniec Podolski]] gubernial gymnasium for boys in 1909 under the name ''Yuri Cheslavovich Neyman''.<ref>[http://zhurnal.lib.ru/k/kitlinskij_a_a/gimnazij.shtml Выпускники Каменец-Подольской гимназии 1883-1920]</ref> He began studies at [[Kharkov University]] in 1912, where he was taught by Russian probabilist [[Sergei Natanovich Bernstein]]. After he read 'Lessons on the integration and the research of the primitive functions' by [[Henri Lebesgue]], he was fascinated with measure and integration.\n\nIn 1921 he returned to [[Poland]] in a program of repatriation of [[POW]]s after the [[Polish-Soviet War]].\nHe earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree at [[University of Warsaw]] in 1924 for a dissertation titled \"On the Applications of the Theory of Probability to Agricultural Experiments\". He was examined by [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]], among others<!-- names to be moved to a trivia section with explication that his exams did not concerned statistics-->. He spent a couple of years in London and Paris on a fellowship to study [[statistics]] with [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Émile Borel]]. After his return to Poland he established the Biometric Laboratory at the [[Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology]] in Warsaw.\n\nHe published many books dealing with experiments and statistics, and devised the way which the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] tests medicines today.\n\nNeyman proposed and studied randomized experiments in 1923.<ref>Neyman, Jerzy. 1923 [1990]. “On the Application of Probability Theory to Agricultural Experiments. Essay on Principles. Section 9.” ''Statistical Science'' 5 (4): 465–472. Trans. Dorota M. Dabrowska and Terence P. Speed.\n</ref> Furthermore, his paper \"On the Two Different Aspects of the Representative Method: The Method of [[Stratified sampling|Stratified Sampling]] and the Method of [[Purposive selection|Purposive Selection]]\", given at the [[Royal Statistical Society]] on 19 June 1934,<ref>Neyman, J.(1934) \"On the two different aspects of the representative method: The method of stratified sampling and the method of purposive selection\", ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'', 97 (4), 557–625 {{jstor|2342192}}</ref> was the groundbreaking event leading to modern scientific sampling.

Thirty-nine students received their Ph.D's under his advisorship. In 1966 he was awarded the [[Guy Medal]] of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] and three years later the U.S.'s [[National Medal of Science]].
