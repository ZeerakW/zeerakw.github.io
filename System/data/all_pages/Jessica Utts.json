She is known for her textbooks on [[statistics]] and her investigation into [[remote viewing]].<ref>[http://archived.parapsych.org/members/j_m_utts.html Jessica Utts at the Parapsychological Association]</ref><ref name=\"Carroll2003\">[[Robert Todd Carroll]]. (2003). ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary|The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions]]''. Wiley. pp. 331-333. ISBN 0-471-27242-6</ref>\n\n== Statistics education ==\nIn 2003, Utts published an article in ''[[The American Statistician|American Statistician]]'', a journal published by the [[American Statistical Association]], calling for significant changes to collegiate level [[statistics]] education.<ref>[http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680Fa11/Shaughnessy/LS.STAT6070/Portfolio%20Reflections/Reflection%203.What%20Educated%20Citizens%20Should%20Know%20About%20Statistics%20and%20Probability.pdf What educated citizens should know about statistics and probability] by Jessica Utts. The American Statistician, 57(2), 74-79, 2003.</ref> In the article she argued that [[curricula]] do a fine job of covering the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] side of statistics, but do a poor job of teaching students the skills necessary to properly interpret statistical results in scientific studies.  The argument continues that common errors found in [[Article (publishing)|news article]]s, such as the common misinterpretation that [[correlative]] studies show [[Causality|causation]], would be reduced if there were significant changes made to standard statistics courses.\n\nUtts was elected to serve as the 111th president of the American Statistical Association, with her term as President-Elect to commence in January 2015, followed by her term as president in 2016.<ref>[http://www.amstat.org/newsroom/pressreleases/2014ASAElections.pdf Jessica Utts Elected 111th ASA President]. American Statistical Association.</ref>\n\n== Investigation of remote viewing ==\n\nIn 1995, the [[American Institutes for Research]] (AIR) appointed a panel consisting primarily of Utts and [[Ray Hyman]] to evaluate a project investigating [[remote viewing]] for [[espionage]] applications, the [[Stargate Project]], which was funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], and carried out initially by [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] and subsequently by [[Science Applications International Corporation|SAIC]].<ref name=\"Marks 2000\">[[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]]; Richard Kammann. (2000). ''[[The Psychology of the Psychic]]''. Prometheus Books. pp. 71-74. ISBN 1-57392-798-8</ref>\n\nA report by Utts claimed the results were evidence of psychic functioning, however Hyman in his report argued Utts' conclusion that ESP had been proven to exist, especially precognition, was premature and the findings had not been independently replicated.<ref>[http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/refs/science/air/hyman.html Evaluation of a Program on Anomalous Mental Phenomena] by [[Ray Hyman]].</ref> According to Hyman \"the overwhelming amount of data generated by the viewers is vague, general, and way off target. The few apparent hits are just what we would expect if nothing other than reasonable guessing and subjective validation are operating.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Ray Hyman]] |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/evidence_for_psychic_functioning_claims_vs._reality| year=2008 |title=The Evidence for Psychic Functioning: Claims vs. Reality |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref> Funding for the project was stopped after these reports were issued. Jessica Utts also co-authored papers with the parapsychologist Edwin May, who took over Stargate in 1985.<ref name=\"Carroll2003\"/> The psychologist [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] noted that as Utts has published papers with May \"she was not independent of the research team. Her appointment to the review panel is puzzling; an evaluation is likely to be less than partial when an evaluator is not independent of the program under investigation.\"<ref name=\"Marks 2000\"/>\n\nUtts is on the executive board of the International Remote Viewing Association (IRVA).<ref>[http://irva.org/About.html \"About IRVA\"].
