He has served as President of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]] (2006-2009), and as President of the [[International Chinese Statistical Association]] (2008-2010).\n\nAfter receiving his Ph.D. in Statistics from the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1989, he was appointed assistant, associate, and full professor at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (1989–2003), and as professor at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (1997–2000), Professor of Statistics and Chairman at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (2000–2003), and as professor at the Princeton University (2003-). He has directed the Committee of Statistical Studies at Princeton since 2006 and currently chairs Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering (since 2012).\n\nHe has coauthored two well-known books on ''Local Polynomial Modeling'' (1996) and ''Nonlinear time series: Parametric and Nonparametric Methods'' (2003) and authored or coauthored over 170 articles on finance, economics, computational biology, semiparametric and non-parametric modeling, statistical learning, nonlinear time series, survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis, and other aspects of theoretical and methodological statistics. He has been consistently ranked as a top 10 highly cited mathematical scientist since the existence of such a ranking. His published work on statistics, financial econometrics, and computational biology has been recognized by the 2000 COPSS Presidents' Award, given annually to an outstanding statistician under age 40, invited speaker at The 2006 International Congress for Mathematicians, The [[Humboldt Research Award]] for lifetime achievement in 2006, The Morningside Gold Medal of Applied Mathematics in 2007,<ref>[http://orfe.princeton.edu/news/fan-receives-medal Prof. Fan receives Morningside Gold Medal of Applied Mathematics]</ref> honoring triennially an outstanding applied mathematician of Chinese descent, [[Guggenheim Fellow]] in 2009,<ref>[http://orfe.princeton.edu/news/guggenheim-fellowship-fan Prof. Jianqing Fan receives Guggenheim Fellowship Award]</ref> Pao-Lu Hsu Prize (2013), presented every three years by the International Chinese Statistical Association to individuals under the age of 50, and Guy Medal in Silver (2014), presented once a year by Royal Statistical Society, and the election to the fellow of [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]], and [[American Statistical Association]]. He was elected to [[Academician]] from [[Academia Sinica]]  ({{zh|c=中央研究院院士}})  in 2012.\n\nFan has many affiliations within Princeton University and around worldwide. He has been on scientific advisory boards to many institutions.
