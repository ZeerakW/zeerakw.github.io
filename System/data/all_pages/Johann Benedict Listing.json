B. Listing was born in [[Frankfurt]] and died in [[Göttingen]]. He first introduced the term  \"[[topology]]\", in a famous article published in 1847, although he had used the term in correspondence some years earlier. He (independently) discovered the properties of the [[Möbius strip|half-twisted strip]] at the same time as [[August Ferdinand Möbius]], and  went further in exploring the properties of strips with higher-order twists ([[paradromic]] rings). He discovered topological invariants which came to be called [[Listing number]]s.<ref>[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce, C. S.]], 1992, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things: The Cambridge Conference Lectures of 1898]]'', edited with introduction by Kenneth Laine Ketner and with commentary by [[Hilary Putnam]], who discusses Listing numbers starting on page 99.
