On Sunday, 13 August 1741, the former field preacher gave his inaugural sermon as pastor of the community [[Ketzin|Etzin]].<ref Name=\"Süß-1\">[http://www.berlin-chronik.de/bms/bmstxt97/9709prob.htm Eckart Elsner: Süßmilchs time Etzin]</ref> Since 1742 he served as [[Provost (religion)|Provost]] in the St. Petri parish in Berlin-Cölln. He became a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in 1745. He discussed with [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].\n[[Image:Berlin GTafel Suessmilch.jpg| thumb | Berlin memorial plaque, [[Berlin-Mitte]] (Brüderstr. 10)]]\nSüßmilch's most important publication on ''The Divine order in the circumstances of the human sex, birth, death and reproduction'' which he wrote in 1741 is regarded as a seminal and pioneering work in [[demography]] and the history of [[population statistics]]. Süssmilch discovered that, on the long run, there is a constant sex ratio of 1,000 female births to 1,050 male births, which he saw as a proof of the Divine working in this World. Due to this work he can be regarded as one of the founding fathers of demography in Germany. However, he refers in his work to [[Caspar Neumann]]'s work, who calculated a monthly statistics of deaths by age and death cause already between 1687 and 1691 in [[Breslau]] (present-day [[Wrocław]]). Süssmilch also worked on [[life tables]].\n\n==Works==\n*''The Royal Residence of Berlin's Growth and Rapid Construction'', 1752 ([http://echo2.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/content/demography/demography/suessmilch_1752 Digitalisat])\n*''The Divine order in the changes in the human sex from birth, death and reproduction of the same'', 2 parts, 1761-1762 (Digitalisat [http://echo2.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/content/ demography/demography/suessmilch_1761 Part 1], [http://echo2.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/content/demography/demography/suessmilch_1762 Part 2])\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{DNB portal|118814834|TYP=}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n<!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Süssmilch, Johann Peter\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = \n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = German priest and statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = September 3, 1707\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Berlin-Zehlendorf|Zehlendorf]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = March 22, 1767\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Berlin]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sussmilch, Johann Peter}}\n[[Category:1707 births]]\n[[Category:1767 deaths]]\n[[Category:German statisticians]]\n[[Category:German Protestant clergy]]\n[[Category:Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Writers from Berlin]]\n[[Category:People from the Margraviate of Brandenburg]]\n[[Category:University of Jena alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Halle alumni]]\n[[Category:German military chaplains]]\n[[Category:Silesian Wars chaplains]]\n[[Category:German male writers]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Johann Peter Süssmilch"}}}}
