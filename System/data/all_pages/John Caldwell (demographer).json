He has researched extensively in Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia since 1959.  He has had a significant impact on demographic teaching, research and policy formulation.\n\n==Biography==\nCaldwell was born in Sydney, Australia and educated at [[Sydney University]] and Sydney Teachers College (1946–48), [[University of New England, Australia|University of New England]] (1955–1958), [[Australian National University]] (PhD, 1959–61).  In February 1948, he married Pat Caldwell née Barrett (12 January 1922 – 24 May 2008).  They raised four sons during their 60 years together, living in south east Asia, Africa, the United States, South Asia and Australia at various times.  Pat participated extensively in demographic research in Africa and Asia and co-authored two books and a considerable number of research papers.<ref>Death notice, [[The Canberra Times]], 26 May 2008</ref>\n\nCaldwell's first academic appointment was at the [[University of Ghana]] (1962–64), and he has been on the staff of the Department of Demography at the Australian National University since 1964 apart from two years leave working for the [[Population Council]] in New York City in 1968 and at the [[Obafemi Awolowo University|University of Ife]], [[Nigeria]] in 1969.  He has been a professor since 1970. In 1989 he helped start the National Centre for [[Epidemiology]] and Population Health at the Australian National University in [[Canberra]]. He remained there till 1998 as Director of its Health Transition Centre.  In 1991 the Health Transition Review was published from the Australian National University until 1997 with Caldwell as its editor.\n\nIn 1995, Caldwell retired as Professor at the Australian National University and Associate Director of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health. An international conference, ''The Continuing Demographic Transition John C Caldwell Seminar'' was held in his honour at the Australian National University. In 1996 he became [[Emeritus Professor]] of Demography at the Australian National University. In 1998 the John C Caldwell Chair in Population, Health and Development was established in his honour at the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health.\n\nCaldwell is a Fellow of the [[Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia]] and has been president of the ''International Union for the Scientific Study of Population'' and a member of the [[Population Council]]. He is the author of 25 books, 128 book chapters and 139 journal articles.\n\n==Influence in demographic research==\nAccording to the ''Encyclopedia of Population'', Caldwell's work on demographic and health transition is \"cited almost ''de rigueur'' by those in these fields\".  He is particularly noted for his \"wealth flows\" theory, which relates demographic transition to changes in intergenerational transfers within the family.  This theory has been criticised for its lack of testability, but it has \"captured the imagination of many researchers\" and stimulated micro-demographic research in the field.  He has worked on many areas of demographic theory, including the importance of education and the status of women in determining demographic change, and the study of the AIDS epidemic, particularly in Africa.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n  | title = Caldwell, John C.\n  | encyclopedia =Encyclopedia of Population\n  | volume = 1\n  | pages = 507\n  | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Reference]]\n  | year = 2003\n  | isbn = 0-02-865677-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  | work=HIVAN fellows\n  | title = Professor Jack Caldwell and Pat Caldwell: The African AIDS Epidemic\n  | publisher =Centre for HIV/AIDS Networking\n  | date = 2002–05\n  | url=http://www.hivan.org.za/gettoknowus/fellows.asp\n  | accessdate = 31 December 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060923001045/http://www.hivan.org.za/gettoknowus/fellows.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 23 September 2006}}</ref> The first global survey of demographers carried out in 2000 reported that John Caldwell and [[Ansley J.
