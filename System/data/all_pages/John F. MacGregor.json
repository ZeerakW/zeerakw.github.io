His pioneering work was in the area of [[latent variable]]/[[multivariate analysis]] (MVA) methods ([[principal components analysis]] and [[partial least squares]]) applied to industrial processes.\n\n==Contributions==\n* A [[latent variable]] framework for [[Model Predictive Control]] (MPC).\n* Latent variable modeling, monitoring and control of batch processes.\n* [[Differential Geometric]] control of polymer processes.\n* Introduction of [[Stochastic]] states in the [[Extended Kalman Filter]] for [[integral action]].\n* Multivariate image analysis\n* Model-based product development\n\n==Education==\nHe received his PhD degree in Statistics, and his M.S. degrees in both [[Statistics]] and in [[Chemical Engineering]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and his Bachelor of Engineering degree from [[McMaster University]] in Canada. At Wisconsin, he worked under the statistician [[George EP Box]].\n\n==Honours and Awards==\nMacGregor is a Fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]], and has received many awards for his work in applied statistics and chemometrics, among them, the prestigious [[Shewhart Medal]] and the [[W.G. Hunter Award]] from the [[American Society for Quality]], and the Herman Wold Medal<ref name=\"J CHEMOMETR Jan 2003\">{{cite journal|title=Professor John F.
