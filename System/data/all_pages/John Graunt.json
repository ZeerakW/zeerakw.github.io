His father was a draper who had moved to London from Hampshire.  In February 1641, Graunt married Mary Scott, with whom he had one son (Henry) and three daughters.\n\nHe worked in his father's shop until his father died in 1662, and became influential in the City. He was able to secure the post of professor of music for his friend [[William Petty]] in 1650. He served in various ward offices in Cornhill ward, becoming a common councilman about 1669–71, warden of the Drapers' Company in 1671 and a major in the trained band.{{sfn|Lewin|2004}}\n\nGraunt, along with William Petty, developed early human statistical and [[census]] methods that later provided a framework for modern demography. He is credited with producing the first [[life table]], giving probabilities of survival to each age. Graunt is also considered as one of the first experts in [[epidemiology]], since his famous book was concerned mostly with [[public health]] statistics.\n\nHis book ''Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality'' (1662 [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] or 1663 New Style) used analysis of the [[Mortality rate|mortality]] rolls in early modern [[London]] as [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and other officials attempted to create a system to warn of the onset and spread of [[bubonic plague]] in the city.  Though the system was never truly created, Graunt's work in studying the rolls resulted in the first statistically based estimation of the population of [[London]]. His work ran to five editions by 1676.\n\nThe erudition of the ''Observations'' led Graunt to the [[Royal Society]], where he presented his work and was subsequently elected a fellow in 1662 with the endorsement of the King.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fellow details|publisher=The Royal Society|url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=2&dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27john%20graunt%27%29|accessdate=2014-07-27}}</ref> He was chosen as a member of the council in November 1664 and represented the society at various meetings.\n\nHis house was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] and he encountered other financial problems leading eventually to bankruptcy. His daughter became a nun in a Belgian convent and Graunt decided to convert to [[Catholicism]] at a time when Catholics and Protestants were struggling for control of England and Europe, leading to prosecutions for recusancy.<ref>\n{{cite book|chapter=Graunt, John|first=C.
