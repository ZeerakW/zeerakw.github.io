In 1936 his parents left  [[Nazi Germany]], and placed him in a [[Quaker]] school in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] countryside while they arranged to settle in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1937, John was reunited with his parents in London, where he attended [[University College School]], [[Hampstead]].\n\nAt age 16, he entered [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He gained a first there in [[economics]], [[philosophy]] and [[politics]] in 1943. His skills in academic-level [[mathematics]] were mostly [[autodidactical]].\n\nAfter the war, Hajnal worked on demography for the   [[United Nations]] in New York, and later for the [[Office of Population Research]], [[Princeton University]].\n\nHe met Berlin-born Nina Lande in New York. They were married from 1950 until her death in 2008 and had three daughters and a son.\n\nReturning to the United Kingdom, he worked at [[Manchester University]] as a statistician from  1953. The family moved to London in 1956, when John was assured a lectureship at the [[London School of Economics]]. He was  Professor of Statistics at the London School of Economics from 1975 until his retirement in 1986.\n\n==Career==\nHajnal is best known for identifying, in a landmark 1965 paper,<ref>{{cite book |chapter=European Marriage Patterns in Perspective |editor-last=Glass |editor2-last=Eversley |title=Population in History, Essays in Historical Demography |year=1965 }}</ref> the historical pattern of marriage of northwest Europe in which people married late and many adults remained single. The geographical boundary of this unusual marriage pattern is now known as the [[Hajnal line]].\n\n* Royal Commission on Population, 1944–48\n* [[United Nations]], New York, 1948–51\n* [[Office of Population Research]], [[Princeton University]], 1951–53\n* [[Manchester University]], 1953–57\n* [[London School of Economics]], 1957–86.
