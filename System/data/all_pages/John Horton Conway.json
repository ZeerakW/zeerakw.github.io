By the age of eleven his ambition was to become a mathematician.\n\nAfter leaving secondary school, Conway entered [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]<ref name=\"whoswho\"/><ref>[http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/people/john-conway Professor John Conway MA PhD FRS]</ref> to study mathematics. Conway who was a \"terribly introverted adolescent\" in school interpreted his admission to Cambridge as an opportunity to transform himself into a new person: an \"extrovert\".<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Siobhan|title=John Horton Conway: the world’s most charismatic mathematician|url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/23/john-horton-conway-the-most-charismatic-mathematician-in-the-world|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Ronan2006\">{{cite book|author=[[Mark Ronan]]|title=Symmetry and the Monster: One of the greatest quests of mathematics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wDjD0PowhIwC&pg=PT163|date=18 May 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-157938-7|pages=163}}</ref>\n\nHe was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1959 and began to undertake research in number theory supervised by [[Harold Davenport]]. Having solved the open problem posed by Davenport on [[Waring's problem|writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers]], Conway began to become interested in infinite ordinals. It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]], where he became an avid [[backgammon]] player, spending hours playing the game in the common room. He was awarded his doctorate in 1964 and was appointed as College Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematics at Cambridge University.\n\nHe left Cambridge in 1986 to take up the appointment to the [[John von Neumann]] Chair of Mathematics at Princeton University.\n\nAccording to a 2015 biography, Conway has been thrice married and twice divorced, and has suffered two heart attacks, two strokes, and depression.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v523/n7561/full/523406a.html Review of ''Genius At Play: The Curious Mind of John Horton Conway'' (Siobhan Roberts Bloomsbury: 2015) by Michael Harris in ''Nature'' 523, 406–407 (23 July 2015) doi:10.1038/523406a]</ref> He resides with his current wife, Diana, in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].\n\n==Research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\n[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|thumb|right|A single [[Bill Gosper|Gosper]]'s [[Gun (cellular automaton)|Glider Gun]] creating \"[[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]]\" in [[Conway's Game of Life]]]]\nAmong amateur mathematicians, he is perhaps most widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]].  He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novel by [[Donald Knuth]]. He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\nHe is also known for the invention of [[Conway's Game of Life]], one of the early and still celebrated examples of a [[cellular automaton]]. His early experiments in that field were done with pen and paper, long before personal computers existed.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], son of [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], he established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nHe extensively investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and determined the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nConway's approach to computing the [[Alexander polynomial]] of knot theory involved [[skein relation]]s, by a variant now called the Alexander-Conway polynomial. After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s. Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings [Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118]\n\n===Group theory===\nHe worked on the [[classification of finite simple groups]] and discovered the [[Conway group]]s. He was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. He, along with collaborators, constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the Conway groups.\n\nWith [[Simon P. Norton]] he formulated the complex of conjectures relating the [[monster group]] with [[modular function]]s, which was named [[monstrous moonshine]] by them.\n\nHe introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>12</sub> to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved the [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]] that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before the work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nHe has also done work in algebra, particularly with [[quaternion]]s. Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)]</ref>\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor [[calculating the day of the week]], he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the '[[Hidden variable theory|no hidden variables]]' principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"\n\n==Books==\nHe has (co-)written several books including the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'', ''Regular Algebra and Finite Machines'', ''Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups'',<ref>{{cite journal|author=Guy, Richard K.|title=Review: ''Sphere packings, lattices and groups'', by J.
