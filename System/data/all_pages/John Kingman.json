He is famous for developing the mathematics of the [[coalescent theory|coalescent]], a theoretical model of inheritance, which is fundamental to modern population genetics.\n\n==Biography==\n\nThe grandson of a [[coal mining|coal miner]] and son of a government scientist with a PhD in chemistry, Kingman was born in [[Beckenham]], Kent and grew up in the outskirts of London, where he attended [[Christ's College, Finchley]], which was then a state [[grammar school]].

A year later, Whittle left Cambridge for the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]], and, rather than follow him there, Kingman moved instead to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] where he resumed his work under [[David George Kendall|David Kendall]]. After another year, Kendall was appointed to a professorship at Cambridge and so Kingman returned to the University.
