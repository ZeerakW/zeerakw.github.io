He helped establish archaeology as a scientific discipline, and was also influential in nineteenth-century debates concerning evolutionary theory.<ref name=Steven>{{cite book|last=Mithen|first=Steven|title=After the ice: a global human history, 20,000–5,000 BC|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-01570-3|pages=|edition=}}</ref>{{rp|514}}\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Lubbock was born in 1834, the son of [[Sir John Lubbock, 3rd Baronet]], a London banker, and was brought up in the family home of [[High Elms Country Park|High Elms Estate]], near [[Downe]] in Kent. During 1842 his father brought home a \"great piece of news\": the young Lubbock said later that he initially thought that the news might be of a new pony, and was disappointed to learn it was only that [[Charles Darwin]] was moving to [[Down House]] in the village.<ref>{{harvnb|Howarth|Howarth|1933|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A540&pageseq=85 72–73]}}</ref> The youth was soon a frequent visitor to Down House, and became the closest of Darwin’s younger friends.<ref name=F192>{{harvnb|Freeman|1978|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A27&pageseq=199 192]}}</ref> Their relationship stimulated young Lubbock’s passion for science and evolutionary theory.<ref name=Steven/>\n\nIn 1845, Lubbock began studies at [[Eton College]], and after graduation was employed by his father's bank (which later amalgamated with [[Coutts & Co]]), of which he became a partner at the age of twenty-two. In 1865 he succeeded to the [[baronetcy]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Avebury, John Lubbock, 1st Baron |volume=3}}</ref>\n\n==Business and politics==\nIn the early 1870s Lubbock became increasingly interested in politics. In 1870, and again in 1874, he was elected as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]]. He lost the seat at the election of 1880, but was at once elected member for [[University of London|London University]], of which he had been vice-chancellor since 1872.<ref name=EB1911/> As an MP, Lubbock had a distinguished political career, with four main political agendas: promotion of the study of science in primary and secondary schools; the national debt, free trade, and related economic issues; protection of ancient monuments; securing of additional holidays and shorter working hours for the working classes.<ref name=Steven/> He was successful with numerous enactments in parliament, including the [[Bank Holidays Act 1871|Bank Holidays Act of 1871]] and the [[Ancient Monuments Act of 1882]], along with another 28 acts of Parliament. When the Liberals split in 1886 on the issue of [[Irish Home Rule]], Lubbock joined the breakaway [[Liberal Unionist Party]] in opposition to Irish home rule. A prominent supporter of the [[Royal Statistical Society|Statistical Society]], he took an active part in criticizing the encroachment of municipal trading and the increase of the municipal debt.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1879 Lubbock was elected the first president of the [[Institute of Bankers]]. In 1881 he was president of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]], and from 1881 to 1886 president of the [[Linnean Society of London]].<ref name=EB1911/> In March 1883 he founded the Bank Clerks Orphanage, which in 1986 became the [http://www.bbfund.org.uk Bankers’ Benevolent Fund] – a charity for bank employees, past and present, and their dependants. In January 1884 he founded the Proportional Representation Society, later to become the [[Electoral Reform Society]].\n\n[[File:Kingsgate-castle.jpg|thumb|Kingsgate Castle in Kent was rebuilt by Lord Avebury.]]\n[[File:John lubbock cartoon.png|thumb|Caricature from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 1882]]\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to the sciences, Lubbock received honorary degrees from the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (where he was [[Rede lecturer]] in 1886), [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] and [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]]; and in 1878 was appointed a trustee of the [[British Museum]]. From 1888 to 1892 he was president of the London Chamber of Commerce; from 1889 to 1890 vice-chairman and from 1890 to 1892 chairman of the [[London County Council]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn February 1890 he was appointed a [[privy councillor]];<ref>[http://www.londongazette.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=26022&geotype=London&gpn=727&type=ArchivedIssuePage&all=&exact=&atleast=&similar= London Gazette issue 26022 11 February 1890]</ref> and was chairman of the committee of design for the new coinage in 1891. On 22 January 1900 he was raised to the [[peerage]] as '''Baron Avebury''', of [[Avebury, Wiltshire|Avebury]], in the county of [[Wiltshire]],<ref>{{LondonGazette| issue=27156 |supp= |startpage=427 |date=23 January 1900}}</ref> his title commemorating the largest Stone Age site in Britain, which he had helped to preserve.

This variation appears in his book ''The Pleasures of Life''.\n\n==Archaeology and biological science==\nIn addition to his work at his father’s bank, Lubbock took a keen interest in archaeology and evolutionary theory. A collection of Iron Age antiquities Lubbock and [[Sir John Evans]] excavated at the site of [[Hallstatt]] in Austria is now in the [[British Museum]]'s collection.<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=24732&plaA=24732-3-2 British Museum Collection]</ref><ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=24732&plaA=24732-3-1 British Museum Collection]</ref> He spoke in support of the evolutionist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] at the famous [[1860 Oxford evolution debate]].  During the 1860s, he published many articles in which he used archaeological evidence to support Darwin’s theory.<ref name=Steven/> In 1864, he became one of the founding members (along with [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and others) of the elite [[X Club]], a dining club composed of nine gentlemen to promote the theories of natural selection and academic liberalism. During the 1860s he held a number of influential academic positions, including President of the [[Ethnological Society of London|Ethnological Society]] from 1864–65, Vice-President of [[Linnean Society]] in 1865, and President of the [[International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences|International Congress of Prehistoric Archaeology]] in 1868. In 1865 he published ''Pre-Historic Times'', which became a standard archaeology textbook for the remainder of the century, with the seventh and final edition published in 1913.<ref name=Steven/>\n\nHis second book, ''On the Origin of Civilization'', was published in 1870. During 1871, he purchased part of the Avebury estate to protect its [[Avebury|prehistoric stone monuments]] from impending destruction. During the early 1870s, he held the position of President of the Royal Anthropological Society from 1871–73, as well as the position of Vice President of the Royal Society in 1871. During this period he worked with [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]], the other key figure in the establishment of the discipline of archaeology.<ref name=Steven/>\n\nIn 1865 Lubbock published what was possibly the most influential archaeological text book of the nineteenth century, ''Pre-historic times, as illustrated by ancient remains, and the manners and customs of modern savages''. He invented the terms \"[[Palaeolithic]]\" and \"[[Neolithic]]\" to denote the Old and New [[Stone Age]]s respectively.  More notably, he introduced a Darwinian-type theory of human nature and development. \"What was new was Lubbock’s ... insistence that, as a result of natural selection, human groups had become different from each other, not only culturally, but also in their biological capacities to utilize culture.\"\n<ref>Trigger, Bruce G. (1989) ''A History of Archaeological Thought'', Cambridge, p.173</ref>\n\nLubbock complained in the preface to ''Pre-Historic Times'' about [[Charles Lyell]]:\n:\"Note.—In his celebrated work on the ''Antiquity of Man'', he coined the term Neolithic in 1865. Sir Charles Lyell has made much use of my earlier articles in the ''Natural History Review'', frequently, indeed, extracting whole sentences verbatim, or nearly so. But as he has in these cases omitted to mention the source from which his quotations were derived, my readers might naturally think that I had taken very unjustifiable liberties with the work of the eminent geologist. A reference to the respective dates will, however, protect me from any such inference. The statement made by Sir Charles Lyell, in a note to page 11 of his work, that my article on the Danish Shell-mounds was published after his sheets were written, is an inadvertence, regretted, I have reason to believe, as much by its author as it is by me.\"<ref>Lubbock J. (1865) ''Pre-Historic Times'', Williams & Norgate, London</ref>\n\nLubbock was also an amateur biologist of some distinction, writing books on [[hymenoptera]] (''Ants, Bees and Wasps: a record of observations on the habits of the social hymenoptera.'' Kegan Paul, London; New York: Appleton, 1884), on insect sense organs and development, on the intelligence of animals, and on other natural history topics.\nHe discovered that ants were sensitive to light in the near [[ultraviolet]] range of the electromagnetic spectrum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lubbock|first=J.|year=1881|title=Observations on ants, bees, and wasps.
