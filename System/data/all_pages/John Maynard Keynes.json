Keynes's grandmother wrote to him saying that, since he was born in Cambridge, people will expect him to be clever.]]\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes was born in [[Cambridge]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[England]], to an upper-middle-class family. His father, [[John Neville Keynes]], was an economist and a lecturer in [[moral science]]s at the University of Cambridge and his mother [[Florence Ada Keynes]] a local social reformer. Keynes was the first born, and was followed by two more children – Margaret Neville Keynes in 1885 and [[Geoffrey Keynes]] in 1887. Geoffrey became a surgeon and Margaret married the Nobel Prize-winning physiologist [[Archibald Hill]].\n\nAccording to the economist and biographer [[Robert Skidelsky]], Keynes's parents were loving and attentive. They remained in the same house throughout their lives, where the children were always welcome to return. Keynes would receive considerable support from his father, including expert coaching to help him pass his scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when his assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of [[Great Depression]] in 1929. Keynes's mother made her children's interests her own, and according to Skidelsky, \"because she could grow up with her children, they never outgrew home\".<ref name=\"SkidelP1\" >\n{{cite book |last=Skidelsky |first=Robert |title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883–1946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman |year=2003 |isbn=0330488678 |pages= 14, 43–46, 456, 263, 834|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1889, at the age of five and a half, Keynes started at the Kindergarten of the [[Perse School for Girls]] for five mornings a week. He quickly showed a talent for arithmetic, but his health was poor leading to several long absences. He was tutored at home by a governess, Beatrice Mackintosh, and his mother.\n\nIn January 1892, at eight and a half, he started as a day pupil at [[St Faith's School|St Faith's]] preparatory school. By 1894, Keynes was top of his class and excelling at mathematics. In 1896, St Faith's headmaster, Ralph Goodchild, wrote that Keynes was \"head and shoulders above all the other boys in the school\" and was confident that Keynes could get a scholarship to Eton.<ref name=\"SkidelP1\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Deane|first=Phyllis|title=The Life and Times of J.

Like many members, Keynes retained a bond to the club after graduating and continued to attend occasional meetings throughout his life. Before leaving Cambridge, Keynes became the President of the [[Cambridge Union Society]] and [[Cambridge University Liberal Club]].\n\nIn May 1904, he received a first class B.A. in mathematics. Aside from a few months spent on holidays with family and friends, Keynes continued to involve himself with the university over the next two years. He took part in debates, further studied philosophy and attended economics lectures informally as a graduate student for one term, which constituted his only formal education in the subject. He also studied for [[Tripos]] in 1905 and, the following year took civil service exams.\n\nThe economist [[Harry Gordon Johnson|Harry Johnson]] wrote that the optimism imparted by Keynes's early life is a key to understanding his later thinking.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=31&item=biography\n|title= Biography of Baron John Maynard Keynes\n|publisher=LiberalHisotry.org\n|author=David Gowland\n|accessdate=29 May 2009}}\n</ref>\nKeynes was always confident he could find a solution to whatever problem he turned his attention to, and retained a lasting faith in the ability of government officials to do good.<ref name = \"Cunningham\" >\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Aschheim | first1 = J.\n| last2 = Tavlas | first2 = G.

According to [[Skidelsky]], the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of World War I provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation to each other and to life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.<ref name = \"SkidelP1\" />\n\n==Career==\nIn October 1906, Keynes's Civil Service career began as a clerk in the [[India Office]]. He enjoyed his work at first, but by 1908 had become bored and resigned his position to return to Cambridge and work on [[probability theory]], at first privately funded only by two [[University don|dons]] at the university – his father and the economist [[Arthur Cecil Pigou|Arthur Pigou]]. By 1909 Keynes had published his first professional economics article in the ''Economics Journal'', about the effect of a recent global economic downturn on India.<ref name = \"Minksky\" >\n{{cite book\n| url= https://books.google.com/?id=9eSu2F4CKNkC&dq=john+maynard+keynes+minsky&printsec=frontcover\n| title= ''John Maynard Keynes'' , chapter 1\n| publisher= and McGraw-Hill Professional\n| author=Hyman Minsky\n| isbn= 978-0-07-159301-4\n| date= 16 April 2008}}\n</ref>\nAlso in 1909, Keynes accepted a lectureship in economics funded personally by [[Alfred Marshall]]. Keynes's earnings rose further as he began to take on pupils for private tuition. On being elected a fellow in 1911 Keynes was made editor of ''[[The Economic Journal]]''. By 1913 he had published his first book, ''Indian Currency and Finance''.<ref>See {{Cite journal|last=Keynes|first=John Maynard|year=1913 |title=Indian Currency and Finance|publisher=Macmillan & Co.|place=London|url= https://archive.org/stream/indiancurrencyan014875mbp#page/n3/mode/2up |pages= }}</ref> He was then appointed to the [[Royal Commission]] on Indian Currency and Finance<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28711|startpage=2809|date=18 April 1913|accessdate=4 August 2009}}</ref> – the same topic as his book – where Keynes showed considerable talent at applying economic theory to practical problems. His written work was published under the name \"J M Keynes\", though to his family and friends he was known as Maynard.(His father, John Neville Keynes, was also always known by his middle name).<ref name = \"clarke\" />\n\n===World War I===\n\nThe British Government called on Keynes's expertise during the First World War. While he did not formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request a few days before hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of [[Hard money (policy)|specie]] payments – the [[convertibility]] of [[banknotes]] into gold – but with Keynes's help the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (then [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]]) was persuaded that this would be a bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before absolutely necessary.\n\nIn January 1915, Keynes took up an official government position at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. Among his responsibilities were the design of terms of credit between Britain and its continental allies during the war, and the acquisition of scarce currencies. According to economist [[Robert Lekachman]], Keynes's \"nerve and mastery became legendary\" because of his performance of these duties, as in the case where he managed to assemble – with difficulty – a small supply of Spanish [[peseta]]s. The secretary of the Treasury was delighted to hear Keynes had amassed enough to provide a temporary solution for the British Government. But Keynes did not hand the pesetas over, choosing instead to sell them all to break the market: his boldness paid off, as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last= Spiegel\n| first= Henry William\n| title= The Growth of Economic Thought\n| year= 1991\n| page= 602\n| isbn= 0-8223-0973-4\n| publisher=Duke University Press\n| location= Durham, UK\n}}\n</ref> In the 1917 King's [[Birthday Honours]], Keynes was appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] for his wartime work,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30111|supp=yes|startpage=5456|date=1 June 1917|accessdate=4 August 2009}}</ref> and his success led to the appointment that would have a huge effect on Keynes's life and career; Keynes was appointed financial representative for the Treasury to the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles peace conference]].

Keynes was initially wary of the \"Welsh Wizard,\" preferring his rival [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]], but was impressed with Lloyd George at Versailles; this did not prevent Keynes from painting a scathing picture of the then-Prime Minister in his ''[[Economic Consequences of the Peace]]''.]]\n\nKeynes's experience at [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] was influential in shaping his future outlook, yet it was not a successful one for him. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent [[World War I reparations|Germany's compensation payments]] being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany's own economy but that of the wider world. Unfortunately for Keynes, conservative powers in the coalition that emerged from the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 coupon election]] were able to ensure that both Keynes himself and the Treasury were largely excluded from formal high-level talks concerning reparations. Their place was taken by the [[Heavenly Twins (Sumner and Cunliffe)|Heavenly Twins]] – the judge [[John Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner|Lord Sumner]] and the banker [[Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe|Lord Cunliffe]] whose nickname derived from the \"astronomically\" high war compensation they wanted to demand from Germany. Keynes was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes.\n\nThe three principal players at Versailles were Britain's Lloyd George, France's [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] and America's [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]].<ref name = \"origins\">\n{{cite book\n|first = Frank\n|last= McDonough\n|pages = 43–46\n|title = The Origins of the First and Second World Wars\n|year=1997\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|isbn=1-4051-0664-6}}\n</ref>\nIt was only Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access; until the 1918 election he had some sympathy with Keynes's view but while campaigning had found his speeches were only well received by the public if he promised to harshly punish Germany, and had therefore committed to extracting high payments. Lloyd George did however win some loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by intervening against the French to ensure the dispatch of much-needed food supplies to German civilians. Clemenceau also pushed for high reparations; generally France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain. Wilson initially favoured relatively lenient treatment of Germany – he feared too harsh conditions could foment the rise of extremism, and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To Keynes's dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to very high repayments being imposed. Towards the end of the conference, Keynes came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole. It involved the writing down of war debts which would have the effect of increasing international trade all round. Lloyd George agreed it might be acceptable to the British electorate. However, America was against it; the US was then the largest creditor and by this time Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace as a warning to future aggressors. Hence despite his best efforts, the end result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" >\n{{cite book\n|last=Skidelsky\n|first=Robert\n|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883–1946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman\n|year=2003\n|isbn=0-330-48867-8\n|pages= 217–220, 245, 260–265, 283, 342–355\n|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn June 1919 he turned down an offer to become chairman of the [[British Bank of Northern Commerce]], a job that promised a salary of £2000 in return for a morning per week of work.\n\nKeynes's analysis on the predicted damaging effects of the treaty appeared in the highly influential book, ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]]'', published in 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policonomics.com/keynes/ |title=John Maynard Keynes |publisher=Policonomics |accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> This work has been described as Keynes's best book, where he was able to bring all his gifts to bear – his passion as well as his skill as an economist. In addition to economic analysis, the book contained pleas to the reader's sense of [[compassion]]:\n{{quote|I cannot leave this subject as though its just treatment wholly depended either on our own pledges or on economic facts. The policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of millions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness should be abhorrent and detestable, –abhorrent and detestable, even if it were possible, even if it enriched ourselves, even if it did not sow the decay of the whole civilised life of Europe.}}\n\nAlso present was striking imagery such as \"year by year Germany must be kept impoverished and her children starved and crippled\" along with bold predictions which were later justified by events:  <blockquote>If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for very long that final war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing.</blockquote>  Keynes's followers claim that his predictions of disaster were borne out when the German economy suffered the [[Inflation in the Weimar republic|hyperinflation of 1923]], and again by the collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the outbreak of World War II. However the historian [[Ruth Henig]] claims that \"most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out\".<ref>Ruth Henig, ''Versailles and After: 1919–1933'' (London: Routledge, 1995), p. 65.</ref><ref>[[Sally Marks]] similarly claims that \"For nearly forty years, historians of twentieth-century diplomacy have argued that the Versailles treaty was more reasonable than its reputation suggests and that it did not of itself cause the Depression, the rise of Hitler, or World War II\". ‘Mistakes and Myths: The Allies, Germany, and the Versailles Treaty, 1918–1921’, ''The Journal of Modern History'', Vol. 85, No. 3 (September 2013), p. 632. Marks also claims that the book is a \"brilliant but warped polemic\" (p. 636) that is \"long discredited by scholars\" and which Keynes regretted writing (p. 656).</ref> Only a fraction of reparations were ever paid. ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'' gained Keynes international fame, but also caused him to be regarded as anti-establishment – it was not until after the outbreak of World War II that Keynes was offered a directorship of a major British Bank, or an acceptable offer to return to government with a formal job. However, Keynes was still able to influence government policy making through his network of contacts, his published works and by serving on government committees; this included attending high-level policy meetings as a consultant.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" />\n\n===In the 1920s===\n[[Image:Gold Bars.jpg|thumb|right| Keynes argued against a return to the [[gold standard]] at parity with pre-war sterling valuation after the [[Great War]].]]\nKeynes had completed his ''[[A Treatise on Probability]]'' before the war, but published it in 1921.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> The work was a notable contribution to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of [[probability theory]], championing the important view that ''probabilities'' were no more or less than [[truth value]]s intermediate between simple truth and falsity. Keynes developed the first upper-lower probabilistic [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of this book, as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with his conventional coefficient of risk and weight, ''c'', in chapter 26. In addition to his academic work, the 1920s saw Keynes active as a journalist selling his work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant. In 1924 Keynes wrote an [[obituary]] for his former tutor\nAlfred Marshall which Schumpeter called \"the most brilliant life of a man of science I have ever read.\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last=Schumpeter\n|first=Joseph\n|title= Ten Great Economists\n|year=2003\n|page= 271\n|isbn=1-932512-09-8\n|publisher=Simon Publications\n}}\n</ref>\nMarshall's widow was \"entranced\" by the memorial, while Lytton Strachey rated it as one of Keynes's \"best works\".<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" />\n\nIn 1922 Keynes continued to advocate reduction of German reparations with ''A Revision of the Treaty''.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> He attacked the post World War I deflation policies with ''A Tract on Monetary Reform'' in 1923<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> – a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation even at the cost of allowing their currency to depreciate. Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of [[Pound sterling|sterling]] to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable. From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> During the 1920s Keynes's pro stimulus views had only limited effect on policy makers and mainstream academic opinion – according to Hyman Minsky one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was \"muddled\".<ref name = \"Minksky\" /> The ''Tract'' had also called for an end to the gold standard. Keynes advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the [[gold standard]], as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy. It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment. The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favour of the gold standard and in 1925 they were able to convince the then Chancellor [[Winston Churchill]] to re-establish it, which had a depressing effect on British industry. Keynes responded by writing ''The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill'' and continued to argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned it in 1931.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" />\n\n===During the Great Depression===\n[[Image:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Depression]] with its periods of worldwide economic hardship formed the backdrop against which Keynes's revolution took place. The image is [[Dorothea Lange]]'s ''[[Migrant Mother]]'' depiction of destitute [[pea-pickers]] in California, taken in March 1936.]]\n\nKeynes had begun a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.<ref name=\"50 greats\" /> The work, ''[[A Treatise on Money|Treatise on Money]]'', was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested – which can happen if interest rates are too high – then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial [[index (economics)|indices]] for representing an accurate – or indeed meaningful – indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular he criticised the justification of Britain's return to the [[Gold Standard]] in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the [[wholesale price index]]. He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and of labour.\n\nKeynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the Great Depression. He believed that budget deficits were a good thing, a product of recessions. He wrote, \"For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as to present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill.\"<ref name=\"Cassidy2011\">{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=John|title=The Demand Doctor|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=10 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAt the height of the [[Great Depression]], in 1933, Keynes published ''The Means to Prosperity'', which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. ''The Means to Prosperity'' contains one of the first mentions of the [[multiplier effect]]. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to Skidelsky, helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 [[London Economic Conference]] opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.<ref name = \"Skid30s\" >\n{{cite book\n|last=Skidelsky\n|first=Robert\n|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883–1946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman\n|year=2003\n|isbn=0-330-488678|pages= 494–500, 504, 509–510\n|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd\n}}</ref>\n\nKeynesian-like policies were adopted by Sweden and Germany, but Sweden was seen as too small to command much attention, and Keynes was deliberately silent about the [[Economy of Nazi Germany#Pre-war economy: 1933–1939|successful efforts of Germany]] as he was dismayed by their imperialist ambitions and their treatment of Jews.<ref name = \"Skid30s\" /> Apart from Great Britain, Keynes's attention was primarily focused on the United States.

It was researched and indexed by one of Keynes's favourite students, later the economist [[David Bensusan-Butt]].<ref>Keith Tribe, ''Economic careers: economics and economists in Britain, 1930–1970'' (1997), p. 61</ref> The work served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. The ''General Theory'' challenged the earlier [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic]] paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish [[full employment]] equilibrium. In doing so Keynes was partly setting himself against his former teachers Marshall and Pigou. Keynes believed the classical theory was a \"special case\" that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century, his own theory being the general one. Classical economists had believed in [[Say's law]], which, simply put, states that \"[[supply creates its own demand]]\", and that in a free market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [[Sticky (economics)|price stickiness]] – the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is [[rationality|rational]] for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of \"aggregate demand\" and \"aggregate supply\" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria – and in those cases, it is the state, and not the market, that economies must depend on for their salvation.\n\n[[File:Keynes caricature Low 1934.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature by [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], 1934]]\n\nThe ''General Theory'' argues that demand, not supply, is the key variable governing the overall level of economic activity. [[Aggregate demand]], which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, is defined by the sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can ''only'' enhance employment and total income by ''first'' increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low employment equilibrium – the demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.<ref name = \"SkidelP2\" >\n{{cite book\n|last=Skidelsky\n|first=Robert\n|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883–1946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman\n|year=2003\n|isbn=0-330-488678\n|pages= 530, 572, 586, 750, 789, 833|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd\n}}</ref>\nThe book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on [[public works]]. \"Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth,\" he wrote in 1928. \"With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments.

[[Hyman Minsky]] and other [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian economists]] have argued that as result of this, Keynes's ideas were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render his concepts with mathematical models like the [[IS/LM model]] (which, they argue, distort Keynes's ideas).<ref name=\"Minksky\"/><ref name=\"K rev. and critics\" /> Keynes began to recover in 1939, but for the rest of his life his professional energies were largely directed towards the practical side of economics – the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the War efforts, post-War negotiations with America, and the new international financial order that was presented at [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]].\n\nIn [[The General Theory]] and later, Keynes responded to the socialists and left-wing liberals who argued, especially during the Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed, domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that didn't pit the interests of countries against each other, and a high degree of freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at [[Bretton Woods Conference|Bretton Woods]] of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], and later to the creation of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and eventually the [[World Trade Organization]]) were aimed to give effect to this vision.<ref>See [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nAlthough Keynes has been widely criticised – especially by members of the [[Chicago School (economics)|Chicago School]] – for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Depression as an exceptional measure to meet the needs of exceptional circumstances.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Universal Man'' Richard Davenport-Hines Collins 2015</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[Image:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|thumb|right| Keynes (right) and the US representative [[Harry Dexter White]] at the inaugural meeting of the International Monetary Fund's Board of Governors in [[Savannah, Georgia]], 1946]]\nDuring World War II, Keynes argued in ''How to Pay for the War'', published in 1940, that the war effort should be largely financed by higher taxation and especially by compulsory saving (essentially workers lending money to the government), rather than [[deficit spending]], in order to avoid [[Inflation (economics)|inflation]]. Compulsory saving would act to dampen domestic demand, assist in channelling additional output towards the war efforts, would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw their savings. In September 1941 he was proposed to fill a vacancy in the Court of Directors of the [[Bank of England]], and subsequently carried out a full term from the following April.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35279|startpage=5489|date=19 September 1941|accessdate=4 August 2009}}<br />{{London Gazette|issue=35511|startpage=1540|date=3 April 1942|accessdate=4 August 2009}}</ref> In June 1942, Keynes was rewarded for his service with a [[hereditary peer]]age in the King's Birthday Honours.<ref name=\"TheLondon\" /> On 7 July his title was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] as \"<small>BARON KEYNES</small>, of Tilton, in the County of Sussex\" and he took his seat in the [[House of Lords]] on the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] benches.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35623|startpage=2987|date=7 July 1942|accessdate=4 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nAs the Allied victory began to look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, as leader of the British delegation and chairman of the [[World Bank]] commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the [[Bretton Woods system]]. The Keynes-plan, concerning an international clearing-union argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the [[bancor]], and new global institutions – a world [[central bank]] and the [[International Clearing Union]]. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses. The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the final outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of [[Harry Dexter White]]. According to US economist [[Brad Delong]], on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proved correct by events.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/reviews/skidelsky3.html\n|title= Review of Robert Skidelsky, John Maynard Keynes: Fighting for Britain 1937–1946\n|publisher=Brad Delong, Berkeley university\n|accessdate=14 June 2009\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe two new institutions, later known as the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), were founded as a compromise that primarily reflected the American vision. There would be no incentives for states to avoid a large [[trade surplus]]; instead, the burden for correcting a trade imbalance would continue to fall only on the deficit countries, which Keynes had argued were least able to address the problem without inflicting economic hardship on their populations.

Keynes had written against the folly of allowing \"decadent and selfish\" speculators and financiers the kind of influence they had enjoyed after World War I. For two decades after World War II public opinion was strongly against private speculators, the disparaging label [[Gnomes of Zürich]] being typical of how they were described during this period. International speculation was severely restricted by the capital controls in place after Bretton Woods. Journalists [[Larry Elliott]] and [[Dan Atkinson]] say 1968 was a pivotal year when power shifted in the favour of private agents such as currency speculators. They pick out a key 1968 event as being when America suspended the conversion of the dollar into gold except on request of foreign governments, which they identify as when the Bretton Woods system first began to break down.\n<ref name=\"failedgods\" >\n{{cite book\n|author1=Larry Elliott | author2 = Dan Atkinson\n|title=The Gods That Failed: How Blind Faith in Markets Has Cost Us Our Future\n|year=2008\n|isbn= 1-84792-030-6\n|page= 78\n|publisher=The Bodley Head Ltd\n}}\n</ref>\n\nCriticisms of Keynes's ideas had begun to gain significant acceptance by the early 1970s as they were able to make a credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself had included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory. For commentators such as economist [[Hyman Minsky]], Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the [[Phillips curve]] which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last=Friedman\n|first=Milton\n|date=March 1968\n|title=The Role of Monetary Policy\n|journal=[[American Economic Review]]\n}}\n</ref>\nFriedman suggested that sustained Keynesian policies could lead to both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as [[stagflation]]. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much of the general public with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other [[Monetarism|Monetarists]] trained in the [[Chicago school of economics]], by the [[Lucas critique]] and by criticisms from Hayek's [[Austrian School]].<ref name=\"K rev. and critics\" /> So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]] was saying economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.<ref name = \"Blinder\" >\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~blinder/papers/01WE.pdf\n|title= Keeping the Keynesian Faith\n|publisher=Princeton University\n|author=Alan Blinder\n|date = June 2001\n|accessdate=27 June 2009\n|authorlink= Alan Blinder\n}}\n</ref>\nKeynesian principles fared increasingly poorly on the practical side of economics – by 1979 they had been displaced by Monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy.<ref name=\"K rev. and critics\"/> However many officials on both sides of the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes, and in 1984 the Federal Reserve officially discarded monetarism, after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy making.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|title=The End of the Age of Milton Friedman\n|accessdate=13 November 2008\n|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-madrick/the-end-of-the-age-of-mil_b_94228.html\n|publisher=The Huffington Post\n|first=Jeff\n|last=Madrick\n|date=8 April 2008\n}}\n</ref>\nNot all academics accepted the criticism against Keynes – Minsky has argued that Keynesian economics had been debased by excessive mixing with neoclassical ideas from the 1950s, and that it was unfortunate the branch of economics had even continued to be called \"Keynesian\".<ref name = \"Minksky\" /> Writing in ''[[The American Prospect]]'', [[Robert Kuttner]] argued it was not so much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of [[capital controls]], which allowed [[capital flight]] from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to [[Gresham's Law]] (where weak currencies undermine strong currencies).<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://prospect.org/article/capital-rues\n|title= Capital Rues\n|publisher=The American Prospect\n|author=Robert Kuttner\n|authorlink=Robert Kuttner\n|date = 23 October 2008\n|accessdate=23 November 2011\n}} Reviewing ''Capital Rules: The Construction of Global Finance'', by [[Rawi Abdelal]], Harvard University Press, and ''The Bridge at the Edge of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing From Crisis to Sustainability'', by [[James Gustave Speth]], Yale University Press</ref>\nHistorian Peter Pugh has stated a key cause of the economic problems afflicting America in the 1970s was the refusal to raise taxes to finance the [[Vietnam War]], which was against Keynesian advice.<ref name = \"forBeginners\">\n{{cite book\n|author=Peter Pugh and Chris Garratt\n|title= Keynes for Beginners\n|year=1993\n|page= 155\n|isbn=1-874166-13-7\n|publisher=Icon\n}}\n</ref>\n\nA more typical response was to accept some elements of the criticisms while refining Keynesian economic theories to defend them against arguments that would invalidate the whole Keynesian framework – the resulting body of work largely composing [[New Keynesian economics]].

During the War as a member of CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts) Keynes helped secure government funds to maintain both companies while their venues were shut. Following the War Keynes was instrumental in establishing the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] and was the founding Chairman in 1946. Unsurprisingly, from the start the two organisations that received the largest grant from the new body were the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells.\n\nLike several other notable British authors of his time, Keynes was a member of the [[Bloomsbury Group]].

His assets were nearly wiped out following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], which he did not foresee, but he soon recouped. At Keynes's death, in 1946, his net worth stood just short of £500,000 – equivalent to about £11 million ($16.5 million) in 2009. The sum had been amassed despite lavish support for various good causes and his personal ethic which made him reluctant to sell on a falling market in cases where he saw such behaviour as likely to deepen a slump.<ref>See ''John Maynard Keynes'' by Skidelsky (2003), pp. 520–21, p. 563 and especially p. 565 where Keynes is quoted as \"It is the duty of a serious investor to accept the depreciation of his holding with equanimity ... any other policy is anti-social, destructive of confidence and incompatible with the working of the economic system.\"</ref>\n\nKeynes built up a substantial collection of [[fine art]], including works, not all of them minor, by [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Georges Seurat]] (some of which can now be seen at the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]).<ref name=\"ES\" /> He enjoyed collecting books: for example, he collected and protected many of [[Isaac Newton]]'s papers.

Keynes had helped campaign for the Liberals at elections from as early as 1906, yet he always refused to run for office himself, despite being asked to do so on three separate occasions in 1920. From 1926 when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, Keynes took a major role in defining the party's economics policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third party status by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]].<ref name = \"SkidelP1\" />\n\nIn 1939 Keynes had the option to enter Parliament as an independent MP with the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|University of Cambridge seat]]. A by-election for the seat was to be held due to the illness of an elderly Tory, and the master of [[Magdalene College]] had obtained agreement that none of the major parties would field a candidate if Keynes chose to stand. Keynes declined the invitation as he felt he would wield greater influence on events if he remained a free agent.<ref name = \"clarke\"/>\n\nKeynes was a proponent of [[eugenics]]. He served as Director of the [[British Eugenics Society]] from 1937 to 1944. As late as 1946, shortly before his death, Keynes declared eugenics to be \"the most important, significant and, I would add, genuine branch of sociology which exists.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Opening remarks: The Galton Lecture|journal=Eugenics Review|author=Keynes, John Maynard|volume=38|issue=1|year=1946|pages=39–40}}</ref>\n\nKeynes once remarked that \"the youth had no religion save Communism and this was worse than nothing.\"<ref name=\"bell177\"/> Marxism \"was founded upon nothing better than a misunderstanding of [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]]\", and, given time, he, Keynes, \"would deal thoroughly with the Marxists\" and other economists to solve the economic problems their theories \"threaten[ed] to cause\".<ref name=\"bell177\"/>\n\nIn 1931 Keynes went on to write the following on Marxism:<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author=Keynes, John Maynard\n|title=Essays in Persuasion\n|year=1931\n|isbn=0-393-00190-3\n}}\n</ref>\n{{quote|How can I accept the Communist doctrine, which sets up as its bible, above and beyond criticism, an obsolete textbook which I know not only to be scientifically erroneous but without interest or application to the modern world?

It is hard for an educated, decent, intelligent son of Western Europe to find his ideals here, unless he has first suffered some strange and horrid process of conversion which has changed all his values.}}\n\nKeynes was also a firm supporter of women's rights and in 1932 became vice-Chairman of the [[Marie Stopes International|Marie Stopes Society]] which provided birth control education. He also campaigned against job discrimination against women and unequal pay. He was an outspoken campaigner for reform of the law on homosexuality.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Death===\nThroughout his life, Keynes worked energetically for the benefit both of the public and his friends; even when his health was poor, he laboured to sort out the finances of his old college,<ref name=\"JMK Ind08Nov08\">\n{{cite news\n|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/john-maynard-keynes-can-the-great-economist-save-the-world-994416.html\n|title=John Maynard Keynes: Can the great economist save the world?\n|accessdate=20 November 2008\n|work=The Independent |location=UK | first=Nick\n| last=Fraser\n| date=8 November 2008\n}}\n</ref> and at [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] he worked to institute an [[International monetary systems|international monetary system]] that would be beneficial for the world economy.
