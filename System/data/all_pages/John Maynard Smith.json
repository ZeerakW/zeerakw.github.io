B. S. Haldane]]. Maynard Smith was instrumental in the application of [[game theory]] to evolution and theorised on other problems such as the [[evolution of sex]] and [[signalling theory]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nJohn Maynard Smith was born in London, the son of the surgeon [[Sidney Maynard Smith]], but following his father's death in 1928, the family moved to [[Exmoor]], where he became interested in [[natural history]]. Quite unhappy with the lack of formal science education at [[Eton College]], Maynard Smith took it upon himself to develop an interest in [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolutionary theory]] and mathematics, after having read the work of old Etonian [[J. B. S. Haldane]], whose books were in the school's library despite the bad reputation Haldane had at Eton for his communism.\n\nOn leaving school, Maynard Smith joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] and started studying engineering at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. When the [[Second World War]] broke out in 1939, he defied his party's line and volunteered for service. He was rejected, however, because of poor [[eyesight]] and was told to finish his [[Bachelor of Engineering|engineering degree]], which he did in 1941. He later quipped that \"under the circumstances, my poor eyesight was a selective advantage—it stopped me getting shot\". The year of his graduation, he married Sheila Matthew, and they later had two sons and one daughter (Tony, Carol, and [[Julian Maynard Smith|Julian]]). Between 1942 and 1947, he applied his degree to [[military aircraft]] design.\n\n===Second degree===\nMaynard Smith then took a change of career, entering [[University College London]] (UCL) to study [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] genetics under Haldane. After graduating he became a lecturer in Zoology at UCL between 1952 and 1965, where he directed the ''[[Drosophila]]'' lab and conducted research on population genetics. He published a popular Penguin book, ''[[The Theory of Evolution]]'', in 1958 (with subsequent editions in 1966, 1975, 1993).\n\nHe became gradually less attracted to communism and became a less active member, finally leaving the Party in 1956<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Charlesworth | first1 = B. \n| authorlink = Brian Charlesworth\n| title = Anecdotal, historical and critical commentaries on genetics.

He subsequently became a [[professor emeritus]]. Prior to his death the building housing much of Life Sciences at Sussex was renamed the John Maynard Smith Building, in his honour.\n\n===''Evolution and the Theory of Games''===\n\nIn 1973 Maynard Smith formalised a central concept in [[evolutionary game theory]] called the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS),<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Nanjundiah | first1 = V. | title = John Maynard Smith (1920–2004) | doi = 10.1007/BF02837646 | journal = Resonance | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = 70–78 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Nov2005/pdf/Nov2005p70-78.pdf| format = PDF}}</ref> based on a verbal argument by [[George R. Price]]. This area of research culminated in his 1982 book ''[[Evolution and the Theory of Games]]''. The [[Hawk-Dove game]] is arguably his single most influential game theoretical model.\n\nHe was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1977. In 1986 he was awarded the [[Darwin Medal]].\n\n===Evolution of sex and other major transitions in evolution===\nMaynard Smith published a book entitled ''The Evolution of Sex'' which explored in mathematical terms, the notion of the \"[[Evolution of sex#Two-fold cost of sex|two-fold cost of sex]]\". During the late 1980s he also became interested in the other major evolutionary transitions with the evolutionary biologist [[Eörs Szathmáry]]. Together they wrote an influential 1995 book ''[[The Major Transitions in Evolution]]'', a seminal work which continues to contribute to ongoing issues in evolutionary biology.<ref name=\"Sterelny\">{{cite book | last = Sterelny | first = Kim | authorlink = Kim Sterelny| title= [[Dawkins vs. Gould]]: Survival of the Fittest| year=2007 | publisher=Icon Books| location = Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=1-84046-780-0}} Also ISBN 978-1-84046-780-2</ref><ref name=\"evolutionthe1st4billionyears\">{{cite book|title= Evolution: The First Four Billion Years| last = Benton| first = Michael| authorlink = Michael J.

In 1995 he was awarded the [[Linnean Medal]] by The [[Linnean Society]] and in 1999 he was awarded the [[Crafoord Prize]] jointly with [[Ernst Mayr]] and [[George C. Williams]]. In 2001 he was awarded the [[Kyoto Prize]].\n\nIn his honour, the [[European Society for Evolutionary Biology]] has an award for extraordinary young evolutionary biology researchers named ''The [[John Maynard Smith Prize]]''.\n\n===''Animal Signals''===\nHis final book, ''Animal Signals'', co-authored with David Harper was published in 2003 on [[signalling theory]].\n\n===Death===\nHe died of [[mesothelioma]], sitting in a high-backed chair, surrounded by books—at his home in [[Lewes]], East Sussex, on 19 April 2004.
