Milnor is a distinguished professor at [[Stony Brook University]] and one of the four mathematicians to have won the [[Fields Medal]], the [[Wolf Prize]], and the [[Abel Prize]] (along with [[Pierre Deligne]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], and [[John G. Thompson]]).\n\n==Early life and career==\nMilnor was born on February 20, 1931 in [[Orange, New Jersey]].<ref>Staff.

He continued on to graduate school at Princeton under the direction of [[Ralph Fox]] and submitted his dissertation, entitled \"[[Regular isotopy|Isotopy]] of [[link (knot theory)|Link]]s\", which concerned [[link group]]s (a generalization of the classical knot group) and their associated link structure, in 1954. Upon completing his doctorate he went on to work at Princeton. He was a professor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] from 1970 to 1990.\n\nHis students have included [[Tadatoshi Akiba]], [[Jon Folkman]], [[John Mather (mathematician)|John Mather]], [[Laurent C. Siebenmann]], and [[Michael Spivak]]. His wife, [[Dusa McDuff]], is a professor of mathematics at [[Barnard College]].\n\n==Research==\nOne of his published works is his proof in 1956 of the existence of [[Seven-dimensional space|7-dimensional]] [[Hypersphere|spheres]] with nonstandard differential structure. Later with [[Michel Kervaire]], he showed that the 7-sphere has 15 [[differentiable structure]]s (28 if one considers orientation).<br/>An ''n''-sphere with nonstandard differential structure is called an [[exotic sphere]], a term coined by Milnor. [[Egbert Brieskorn]] found simple algebraic equations for 28 complex hypersurfaces in complex 5-space such that their intersection with a small sphere of dimension 9 around a [[Singular point of a curve|singular point]] is diffeomorphic to these exotic spheres. Subsequently Milnor worked on the [[topology]] of isolated [[Singular point of a curve|singular points]] of complex hypersurfaces in general, developing the theory of the [[Milnor fibration]] whose fiber has the [[homotopy]] type of a bouquet of μ spheres where μ is known as the [[Milnor number]]. Milnor's 1968 book on his theory inspired the growth of a huge and rich research area which continues to mature to this day.\n\nIn 1961 Milnor disproved the [[Hauptvermutung]] by illustrating two [[simplicial complex]]es which are [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] but [[Combinatorial topology|combinatorially]] distinct.\n\nMilnor's current interest is dynamics, especially holomorphic dynamics. His work in dynamics is summarized by Peter Makienko in his review of ''Topological Methods in Modern Mathematics'':-\n\n<blockquote>It is evident now that low-dimensional dynamics, to a large extent initiated by Milnor's work, is a fundamental part of general dynamical systems theory. Milnor cast his eye on dynamical systems theory in the mid-1970s. By that time the Smale program in dynamics had been completed. Milnor's approach was to start over from the very beginning, looking at the simplest nontrivial families of maps. The first choice, one-dimensional dynamics, became the subject of his joint paper with [[William Thurston|Thurston]]. Even the case of a unimodal map, that is, one with a single critical point, turns out to be extremely rich. This work may be compared with [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré's]] work on [[Diffeomorphism#Topology|circle diffeomorphisms]], which 100 years before had inaugurated the qualitative theory of dynamical systems. Milnor's work has opened several new directions in this field, and has given us many basic concepts, challenging problems and nice theorems.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lyubich|first=Mikhail|title=Holomorphic Dynamics and Renormalization: A Volume in Honour of John Milnor's 75th Birthday|year=1993|location=Houston, Texas|pages=85–92|authorlink=Milnor's Program in Dynamics|editor=Michael Yampolsky|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nHe was an editor of the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' for a number of years after 1962. He has written a number of books.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 1962 Milnor was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] for his work in differential topology.
