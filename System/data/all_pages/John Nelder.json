While leading research at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]], Nelder developed and supervised the updating of the [[statistical software]] packages [[GLIM (software)|GLIM]] and [[GenStat]]: Both packages are flexible [[high-level programming language]]s that allow statisticians to formulate [[linear models]] concisely.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/23/john-nelder-obituary | title=John Nelder obituary | publisher=The Guardian | date=23 September 2010 | accessdate=12 December 2013 | author=Payne, Roger; Senn, Stephen}}</ref> GLIM influenced later environments for [[computational statistics|statistical computing]] such as [[S-PLUS]] and [[R (programming language)|R]]. Both GLIM and GenStat have powerful facilities for the [[analysis of variance]] for [[randomized block design|block]] [[design of experiments|experiments]], an area where Nelder made many contributions.\n\nIn [[statistical theory]], Nelder and Wedderburn proposed the [[generalized linear model]]. Generalized linear models were formulated by John Nelder and [[Robert Wedderburn (statistician)|Robert Wedderburn]] as a way of unifying various other statistical models, including [[linear regression]], [[logistic regression]] and [[Poisson regression]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Nelder | first=John | first2=Robert |last2=Wedderburn |authorlink2 = Robert Wedderburn (statistician) | title=Generalized Linear Models | year=1972 | journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]].

W. F. Edwards]]) emphasized the importance of the [[likelihood function|likelihood]] in [[data analysis]], promoting this \"likelihood approach\" as an alternative to [[frequentist]] and [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] statistics.\n\nIn [[response surface methodology|response-surface]] [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], Nelder and Roger Mead proposed the [[Nelder–Mead method <!-- sic. it's a heuristic, as [[Michael J. D. Powell]] showed in 1973 -->|Nelder-Mead simplex heuristic]], widely used in engineering and statistics.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Brushford, Somerset|Brushford]], near [[Dulverton]], Somerset, Nelder was educated at [[Blundell's School]] and [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], where he read mathematics.\n\nNelder's appointments included Head of the Statistics Section at the [[Horticulture Research International|National Vegetable Research Station]], [[Wellesbourne]] from 1951 to 1968 and Head of the Statistics Department at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] from 1968 to 1984. During his time at Wellesbourne he spent a year (1965–1966) at the Waite Institute in Adelaide, South Australia, where he worked with Graham Wilkinson on Genstat. He held an appointment as Visiting Professor at [[Imperial College London]] from 1972 onwards.\n\nHe was responsible, with [[Max Nicholson]] and [[James Ferguson-Lees]], for debunking the [[Hastings Rarities]] – sightings of a series of rare birds, preserved by a [[taxidermy|taxidermist]] and provided with bogus histories.<ref name=\"BBAug62\">Nelder, J.A. (1962). A statistical examination of the Hastings Rarities. ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]'', August 1962.</ref>\n\nNelder died on 7 August 2010 in [[Luton and Dunstable Hospital]], taken there after a fall at home, which was incidental to the cause of death.<ref>{{cite web|last=Payne|first=Roger|title=John Ashworth Nelder|url=http://www.vsni.co.uk/featured/john-nelder/|publisher=VSN International|accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and distinctions==\n\nNelder was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1976<ref>[http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqSearch=RefNo=='EC/1981/28'&dsqDb=Catalog Royal Society citation]</ref> and received the [[Royal Statistical Society]]'s [[Guy Medal]] in Gold in 2005. He was also the recipient of the inaugural Karl Pearson Prize of the [[International Statistical Institute]], with [[Peter McCullagh]], \"for their monograph Generalized Linear Models (1983)\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The inaugural Karl Pearson Prize|url=http://www.isi-web.org/8736|publisher=The International Statistical Institute|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs tribute on his eightieth birthday, a [[festschrift]] ''Methods and Models in Statistics: In Honour of Professor John Nelder, FRS'' was edited by Niall Adams, Martin Crowder, David J Hand & Dave Stephens, Imperial College Press (2004).<ref>[http://www.icpress.co.uk/profiles/newsletter04.shtml Imperial College Press Newsletter]</ref>\n\nThe first annual John Nelder memorial lecture was help at Imperial College London, on 8 March 2012, as part of the Mathematics department Colloquium series.  The lecture was given by John's long term co-author, Prof [[Peter McCullagh]]. An interview<ref>[http://stats.ma.ic.ac.uk/~nadams/podcast/podcast6.mp3]</ref> with Peter McCullagh, about statistical modelling, includes some reminiscences about John.\n\n==Selected publications==\n\n* JN and R.
