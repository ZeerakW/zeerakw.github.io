Elizabeth was the sister and heiress of Sir John Pakington, the 8th and last Baronet Pakington of Ailesbury. John Somerset was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Oriel College, Oxford]] and assumed in 1830 by Royal License the surname of Pakington in lieu of his patronymic on inheriting the estates of his maternal uncle. These included [[Westwood House, Worcestershire|Westwood House in Worcestershire]] and Pakington moved in there with his first wife in 1832.\n\n==Political career==\nPakington was elected at the fourth attempt as the Tory [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Droitwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Droitwich]] in 1837, a seat he held until 1874. He was given office by Sir [[Robert Peel]] in 1841 and created in 1846 first Baronet Pakington of the second creation, of Westwood in the County of Worcester. He next served under [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] as [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] in 1852 and was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] the same year. The government lasted only a year and in opposition he developed an interest in education reform, introducing in 1855 an unsuccessful Education Bill which foreshadowed the 1870 Act. \n\nWith the Tories back in power he again held office under Lord Derby as [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] from 1858 to 1859 and from 1866 to 1867. As First Lord he commissioned the first ironclad warship, HMS ''Warrior'', launched in 1860. Under Derby and his successor [[Benjamin Disraeli]] he was [[Secretary of State for War]] from 1867 to 1868. He was appointed a [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] in 1859.\n\nHe lost his seat in the Commons in the 1874 election and was raised to the peerage as '''Baron Hampton''', of [[Hampton Lovett]] and of Westwood in the County of Worcester.\n\n[[File:John Somerset Pakington, Vanity Fair, 1870-02-12.jpg|left|thumb|Pakington caricatured by \"ATn\" in ''Vanity Fair'', 1870]]\n==Other public appointments==\nHe served for many years as chairman of the Worcestershire Quarter Sessions. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in Jun, 1858.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/Lists-of-Royal-Society-Fellows-1660-2007/ |title=Lists of Royal Society Fellows 1660-2007 |publisher=The Royal Society |accessdate=4 August 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100324095152/http://royalsociety.org:80/Lists-of-Royal-Society-Fellows-1660-2007/ |archivedate=24 March 2010 }}</ref> He was also President of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] from 1861 to 1863 and [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Chief Civil Service]] [[Commissioner]] from 1875 until his death.\n\n==Family==\nLord Hampton married firstly Mary, daughter of  Moreton Aglionby Slaney, on 14 August 1822.
