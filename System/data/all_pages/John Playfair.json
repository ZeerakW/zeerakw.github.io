He is perhaps best known for his book ''Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth'' (1802), which summarised the work of [[James Hutton]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/NHM104643 {{cite book | author = Playfair, John | title = Illustration of the Huttonian Theory  | year = 1802 | publisher = Cadell & Davies | location = Edinburgh }}] at [http://archive.org archive.org]</ref> It was through this book that Hutton's principle of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], later taken up by [[Charles Lyell]], first reached a wide audience. Playfair's textbook ''Elements of Geometry'' made a brief expression of [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]] known now as [[Playfair's axiom]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn at Benvie, near [[Dundee]], where his father, Rev James Playfair (d.1772), was a [[kirk minister]].<ref>http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf</ref>\n\nPlayfair was educated at home until the age of fourteen, when he entered the [[University of St Andrews]]. In 1766, when only eighteen, he was a candidate for the chair of mathematics in [[Marischal College]] (now part of the [[University of Aberdeen]]), and, although he was unsuccessful, his claims were admitted to be high.\n\nSix years later he applied for the chair of natural philosophy in his own university, but again without success, and in 1773 he was offered and accepted the [[benefice]] of the united parishes of [[Liff, Scotland|Liff]] and Benvie, vacant by the death of his father. Playfair continued, however, his mathematical and physical studies, and in 1782 he resigned his charge to become the tutor of [[Ferguson of Raith]]. By this arrangement, Playfair was able to be frequently in [[Edinburgh]] and to cultivate the [[Scottish literature|literary]] and scientific society for which it was at that time specially distinguished. In particular, he attended the natural history course of [[John Walker (naturalist)|John Walker]].  Through [[Nevil Maskelyne]], whose acquaintance he had first made in the course of the celebrated [[Schiehallion experiment]]s in 1774, he also gained access to the scientific circles of London. In 1785 when [[Dugald Stewart]] succeeded Ferguson in the Edinburgh chair of [[moral philosophy]], Playfair succeeded the former in that of mathematics.\n\n==Mature work==\n[[File:Memorial to John Playfair, Old Calton Burial Ground.jpg|thumb|250px|Memorial to John Playfair, Old Calton Burial Ground]]\n[[File:John Playfair Monument.jpg|thumb|250px|Monument to John Playfair on [[Calton Hill]], Edinburgh]]\nIn 1795 Playfair published an alternative, more stringent formulation of Euclid's parallel postulate, which is now called [[Playfair's axiom]]. Although the axiom bears Playfair's name, he did not create it, but credited others, in particular [[William Ludlam]], with its prior use.<ref>J. Playfair and Euclid, ''Elements of geometry; containing the first six books of Euclid, with two books on the geometry of solids. To which are added, elements of plane and spherical trigonometry'', J.B. Lippincott & Co, 1860, p. 291.  Available online from [[Google Books]]. See also Cajori's [http://books.google.com/books?id=eO0gAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA302 ''A History of Mathematics''].</ref>\n\nIn 1802, Playfair published his celebrated volume entitled ''Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth.'' The influence exerted by [[James Hutton]] on the development of geology is thought to be largely due to its publication. In 1805 Playfair exchanged the chair of mathematics for that of natural philosophy in succession to [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]], whom also he succeeded as general secretary to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. He took a prominent part, on the liberal side, in the [[ecclesiastical]] controversy that arose in connection with Sir [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]]'s appointment to the post he had vacated, and published a [[satirical]] letter (1806).\n\nPlayfair was an opponent of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s ''[[vis viva]]'' principle, an early version of the [[conservation of energy]]. In 1808, he launched an attack<ref>''Edinburgh Review'', '''12''', 1808, 120–130</ref> on [[John Smeaton]] and [[William Hyde Wollaston]]'s work championing the theory.\n\n==Family==\nJohn's brothers were architect [[James Playfair]], solicitor [[Robert Playfair]] and engineer [[William Playfair]]. His nephew, [[William Henry Playfair]] (1790–1857) was an eminent architect in Scotland.\nAlthough an eminent man, Playfair was buried in an unmarked grave in [[Old Calton Burial Ground]], on Waterloo Place in Edinburgh. His, and his brother, James's graves were marked by a plaque unveiled in 2011 following a local campaign.<ref>http://www.ewht.org.uk/news/183/102/Fitting-tribute-to-a-distinguished-man</ref> The monument to his memory by William Henry Playfair, on [[Calton Hill]],<ref>''Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen'' (1856), reproduced in ''[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/playfair_john.htm Significant Scots]''</ref> is visible from the spot. In later life he admired and proposed to the wealthy widow [[Jane Davy|Jane Apreece]].

Playfair, appeared at Edinburgh in 1822.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/worksjohnplayfa04playgoog See the Collected Works of John Playfair on the Internet Archive (www.archive.org)]</ref>\n\nHis writings include a number of essays contributed to the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' from 1804 onwards, various papers in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' (including his earliest publication, \"On the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities\", 1779, and an \"Account of the Lithological Survey of Schehallion\", 1811) and in the ''[[Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]'' (\"On the Causes which Affect the Accuracy of Barometrical Measurements\" and others), the articles \"Aepinus\" and \"Physical Astronomy\", and a \"Dissertation on the Progress of Mathematical and Physical Science since the Revival of Learning in Europe\" in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (Supplement to fourth, fifth and sixth editions).\n\nHis ''[[Elements of Geometry (Playfair)|Elements of Geometry]]'' first appeared in 1795 and has passed through many editions; his ''[[Outlines of Natural Philosophy]]'' (2 vols., 1812–1816) consist of the propositions and [[formulae]] which were the basis of his class lectures. Playfair's contributions to [[pure mathematics]] were not considerable, his papers \"On the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities\" and \"On the Causes which Affect the Accuracy of Barometrical Measurements\", and his ''Elements of Geometry'', all already referred to, being the most important. His lives of [[Matthew Stewart (mathematician)|Matthew Stewart]], [[James Hutton|Hutton]], and [[John Robison (physicist)|Robison]], many of his [[review]]s, and above all his \"Dissertation\" are of the utmost value.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.chlt.org/sandbox/lhl/dsb/page.34.php?size=240x320 Dictionary of Scientific Biography]\n* {{MacTutor Biography|id=Playfair}}\n* [http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/playfair_john.htm Significant Scots: John Playfair]\n* [http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?search=ss&sText=playfair&LinkID=mp03581 National Portrait Gallery]\n* John Playfair (1836) [http://books.google.com/books?id=2XlaAAAAcAAJ Elements of Geometry] from [[Google books]], see page 22 for parallel axiom.\n* {{worldcat id|lccn-n83-60960}}\n* From the [[Linda Hall Library]]\n** Playfair's (1802) [http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/ref/collection/earththeory/id/51246 ''Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth]\n** Playfair's (1815) [http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/ref/collection/earththeory/id/24872 ''Explication de Playfair sur la th&eacute;orie de la terre par Hutton'']\n\n{{EB1911}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Playfair, John\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION =Scottish scientist and mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 10 March 1748\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =Angus\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 20 July 1819\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = Burntisland, Fife, Scotland\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Playfair, John}}\n[[Category:1748 births]]\n[[Category:1819 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Dundee]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of St Andrews]]\n[[Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Founder Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:People of the Scottish Enlightenment]]\n[[Category:Scottish physicists]]\n[[Category:Scottish mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Scottish scholars and academics]]\n[[Category:Burials at Old Calton Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Ministers of the Church of Scotland]]\n[[Category:18th-century British mathematicians]]\n[[Category:18th-century Scottish people]]\n[[Category:19th-century British mathematicians]]\n[[Category:19th-century Scottish people]]\n[[Category:Scottish mineralogists]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "John Playfair"}}}}
