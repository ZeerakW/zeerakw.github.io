Scion of one of the most powerful aristocratic families, his great achievements, says  [[A. J. P. Taylor]], were based on his indefatigable battles in Parliament over the years on behalf of the expansion of liberty; after each loss he tried again and again, until finally his efforts were largely successful.  Woodward, however, argued that he was too much the abstract theorist, so that \"He was more concerned with the removal of obstacles to civil liberty than with the creation of a more reasonable and civilized society.<ref>E. L. Woodward, ''The Age of Reform, 1815-1870'' (2nd ed . 1962) p 95</ref> Nevertheless Russell led his Whig Party into support for reform; he was the principal architect of the great [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832.]] As Prime Minister his luck ran out.  He took much of the blame for the government's failures in dealing with the Irish famine. Taylor concludes that as prime minister, he was not a success.  Indeed, his Government of 1846 to 1852 was the ruin of the Whig party: it never composed a Government again, and his Government of 1865 to 1866, which might be described as the first Liberal Government, was very nearly the ruin of the Liberal party also.<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, ''Essays in English History'' (1976) p 67</ref>\n\n==Background and education==\nRussell was born small and premature into the highest echelons of the British aristocracy. [[Duke of Bedford|The Russell family]] had been one of the principal Whig dynasties in England since the 17th century, and were among the richest handful of aristocratic landowning families in the country, but as a younger son of the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|6th Duke of Bedford]] he was not expected to inherit the family estates. As a younger son of a Duke, he bore the courtesy title \"Lord John Russell\", but as he was not a peer in his own right he was entitled to sit in the House of Commons until he was made an earl and moved to the House of Lords in 1861.\n\nAfter being withdrawn from [[Westminster School]] due to ill health, Russell was educated by tutors. He attended the [[University of Edinburgh]], 1809 and 1812; he did not take a degree.  Although of small stature and often in poor health, he traveled widely in Britain and on the continent.<ref>John Prest, ''Lord John Russell'' (University of South Carolina Press, 1972), 11-13.</ref>\n\n==Public life==\nRussell entered the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as a [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] in 1813. In 1819, Russell embraced the cause of parliamentary reform, and led the more reformist wing of the Whigs throughout the 1820s. When the Whigs came to power in 1830 in [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]'s government, Russell entered the government as [[Paymaster of the Forces]], and was soon elevated to the Cabinet. He was one of the principal leaders of the fight for the [[Reform Act 1832]], earning the nickname '''Finality Jack''' from his complacency pronouncing the Act a final measure.<ref>another source uses the nickname \"Finality John\", RUSSELL, John, Earl, known best as Lord John Russell, The Nuttall Encyclopaedia, (Project Gutenburg, e book, 1956)</ref> In 1834, when the leader of the Commons, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Lord Althorp]], succeeded to the peerage as [[Earl Spencer (peerage)|Earl Spencer]], Russell became the leader of the Whigs in the Commons, a position he maintained for the rest of the decade, until the Whigs fell from power in 1841. In this position, Russell continued to lead the more reformist wing of the Whig party, calling, in particular, for religious freedom, and, as Home Secretary in the late 1830s, played a large role in democratizing the government of British cities (other than London). During his career in Parliament, Lord John Russell represented the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]].<ref>Prest (2009)</ref>\n\nTaylor emphasizes Russell's central role in the expansion of liberty and leading his Whig Party to a commitment to a reform agenda.<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, ''Essays in English History'' (1976)</ref>  In 1845, as [[leader of the Opposition (UK)|leader of the Opposition]], Russell came out in favour of repeal of the [[Corn Laws]], forcing [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] to follow him. When the Conservatives split the next year over this issue, the Whigs returned to power and Russell became Prime Minister.\n\nRussell's premiership was frustrated, because due to party disunity and infighting, he was unable to secure the success of many of the measures he was interested in passing.  Russell's first government coincided with the [[Great Irish Famine]] of the late 1840s. Russell was unable to find a solution.  He fought with his headstrong Foreign Secretary, [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], whose belligerence and support for continental revolution he found embarrassing. Palmerston was forced to resign when he recognized [[Napoleon III]]'s coup of 2 December 1851, without royal approval.\n\nPalmerston turned the vote on a militia bill into a [[Motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom|vote of confidence]] on the government. The majority vote in favour of an amendment proposed by Palmerston caused the downfall of Russell's ministry on 21 February 1852. This was Palmerston's famous \"tit for tat with Johnny Russell\", a revenge for his dismissal by Russell as Foreign Minister.<ref>Prest, 2009</ref>\n\n==In Opposition February 1852 – December 1852==\nThe July 1852 general election saw the election of 330 Conservatives and 324 Whigs to the Parliament. Neither had an overall majority for 38 members who were technically Conservatives, were actually Peelites (followers of the late Robert Peel).  The Peelites had deserted the Conservatives to vote for the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in June 1846. The Corn Laws had imposed a tariff on all cheap imported wheat and, thus, kept the price of wheat and the bread made from wheat high. This served the interests of landed aristocracy which was the main body of support for the Conservative Party. However, the high price of wheat and bread added greatly to the desperation of poor and hungry in England and Ireland.<ref>Prest, 2009</ref>\n\nThe new Parliament  included 113 \"Free Traders\" who were more radical than the Peelites. They felt that the tariffs on all imported consumer goods should be removed, not just the tariff on wheat or \"corn.\"  There were also 63 members of the \"Irish Brigade,\" made up of Irish members interested in the Tenant Rights legislation for the protection of the tenant farmers in Ireland.  None of these minor groups were interested in forming a government with the Conservatives because of the bitterness left over from the repeal of the Corn Laws. However, John Russell of the Whigs could not attract enough of the minor party members to form a government either. Other issues handled during the recent Russell government had alienated these three minor groups from the Whigs also. Thus, Queen Victoria asked the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] to form a minority government. It only lasted until December 1852.<ref>Prest, 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:John Russell, 1st Earl Russell by Sir Francis Grant detail.jpg|thumb|Portrait of John Russell by [[Francis Grant (artist)|Francis Grant]], 1853]]\n\n==Foreign Minister in the Aberdeen Government==\nRussell, as the leader of the Whig Party, then brought it into a new coalition government with the [[Peelites|Peelite Conservatives]], headed by the Peelite [[George Hamilton Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]].  Palmerston could not possibly be appointed as Foreign Minister but he had to be a part of the new Aberdeen government and became [[Home Secretary]]. Russell continued to serve as Leader of the Whig Party in the House of Commons. As the leader of the largest party in the Aberdeen coalition government, Russell was needed in the new government. Accordingly, on 28 December 1852, Russell was appointed [[Foreign Minister|Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]].\n\nIn the eyes of many, including the Queen and Aberdeen, his jockeying for position against Palmerston was one of the causes of the inability of the administration to take a firm direction. It was a contest that Palmerston won; having entered the administration as the expected Whig heir, Russell left it having been overtaken by Palmerston.<ref>B. K. Martin, \"The Resignation of Lord Palmerston in 1853: Extracts from Unpublished Letters of Queen Victoria and Lord Aberdeen\", ''Cambridge Historical Journal'', Vol. 1, No. 1 (1923), pp. 107-112, Cambridge University Press, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3020826 JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==The Crimean War==\n{{main|Crimean War}}\nTogether with Palmerston, Russell was instrumental in getting Britain to join France in thwarting the threat of Russia against the Ottoman Empire. They did so as a member of the Aberdeen government and against the wishes of the cautious, Russophile Earl of Aberdeen. The [[Ottoman Empire]] was in a state of decline and several nations in Europe sought acquire portions of its territory. Russia sought to assert its territorial claims to the Balkans. However, just as soon as Louis Bonaparte had completed his coup against the Second Republic of France and assumed the title [[Napoleon III]], he sent an ambassador to the Ottoman Empire with instructions to obtain from the Ottomans, a guarantee that France was to be the exclusive \"protector of Christian sites\" in Jerusalem and the [[Holy Land]]. Louis Bonaparte was the nephew of Napoleon I, Emperor of France, and many British public officials - like Aberdeen - felt that Louis Bonaparte was merely seeking foreign adventure and aggrandizement and would sooner or later involve Britain in another series of wars like those [[Napoleonic Wars|wars against France and Napoleon]] from 1793 to 1815. France had long been seen as an opponent of British interests, and that perception had not changed since 1815. Accordingly, much of the British public sided with Russia in what was now being called the \"[[Eastern Question]].\"<ref>Stuart J. Reid, '' Lord John Russell'' (1895) ch 10</ref>  However, as time passed, the horrific losses of British soldiers, reported in detail in the press, caused British public opinion to turn hostile. The British government was worried about the outcome of the rising tensions  over Eastern Question. Accordingly, Aberdeen sent, [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe|Lord Stratford de Redcliffe]], a diplomat of considerable experience, to the Ottoman Empire, to oversee British interests.\n\nWhen the Ottomans gave way to Louis Bonaparte's demands, Russia strongly objected and on 7 May 1853 one of Russia's leading statesmen, Prince [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov]], arrived in Turkey to demands an agreement favourable to Russia. During the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774]], Russia had occupied the Turkish/Ottoman-controlled provinces of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] (modern Romania). Under the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] signed in 1774, Russia had given these Danubian provinces back to the Ottoman Empire in exchange for Turkish recognition of Russia's exclusive right to \"protect the Christian sites in Jerusalem and the Holy Land.\" Menshikov, using threats, obtained his agreement with The Porte.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'' (2010) pp 107-14</ref>\n\nThe British elite saw a growing Russian threat not just to the Ottomans but also to Europe and even India.  The balance of power was being upset. London cooperated with Paris. France sent the French ship-of-the-line to the Black Sea, in the spring of 1852, as a show of force against the Russians. The Ottomans reversed themselves and signed a treaty acknowledging the French and the Vatican as the official protectors of the Christian sites in the Holy Land. The Russians responded by sending its 4th and 5th Army Corps into Wallachia and Moldavia.  It expected Austria and Prussia would support this move, but they were opposed and Russia had no allies. The Aberdeen government resisted active pursuit of the war. Lord Russell, frustrated by the Prime Minister's delays, resigned from the government on 21 February 1853. Aberdeen replaced Russell with [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]].<ref>Stuart J. Reid, '' Lord John Russell'' (1895) ch 10</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia on 23 October 1853. The Russian fleet defeated the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Sinope]] on 30 November 1853. After Russia had ignored the Anglo-French ultimatum, both France and Britain declared war on Russia on 28 March 1854.  The war was fought chiefly in the Black Sea, with the great Russian base of Sebastopol in Crimea as the main target. In September 1854, British, French and Turkish troops landed on the Crimean Peninsula and set siege to [[Sevastopol]]. After a campaign marked by gross mismanagement and very high rates of death from disease,  [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|Sevastopol finally fell]]. Public opinion had turned hostile.<ref>Stuart J. Reid, '' Lord John Russell'' (1895) ch 11</ref>\n\nA motion in Parliament to investigate the mismanagement became a vote of confidence in the Aberdeen government and in the Secretary for War. Accordingly, when the Robuck motion passed, Aberdeen treated the vote as a vote of \"no confidence\" on his government and resigned.  \nUpon the resignation of the Earl of Aberdeen, Lord Palmerston was asked formed a new government. John Russell was sent to Vienna to negotiate (accepting the Colonial Office) but sacrificed himself to protect negotiation confidentiality, and temporarily retired from politics in 1855, focusing on writing.<ref>Stuart J. Reid, '' Lord John Russell'' (1895) ch 12-13</ref>\n\n==Foreign Minister in the Palmerston Government 1859–1865==\nIn 1859, following another short-lived Conservative government, Palmerston and Russell made up their differences, and Russell consented to serve as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] in a new Palmerston cabinet - usually considered the first true [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Cabinet. This period was a particularly eventful one in the world outside Britain, seeing the [[Unification of Italy]], the [[American Civil War]], and the 1864 war over [[Schleswig-Holstein]] between Denmark and the German states. Russell arranged the [[London Conference of 1864]], but failed to establish peace in the war. His tenure of the Foreign Office was noteworthy for the famous dispatch in which he defended Italian independence: \"Her Majesty's Government will turn their eyes rather to the gratifying prospect of a people building up the edifice of their liberties, and consolidating the work of their independence, amid the sympathies and good wishes of Europe\" (27 October 1860).<ref>Stuart J. Reid, '' Lord John Russell'' (1895) ch 14</ref>\n\n==The House of Lords 1860==\nRussell was elevated to the peerage as '''[[Earl Russell]]''', of [[Kingston Russell]] in the County of [[Dorset]], and '''Viscount Amberley''', of [[Amberley, Gloucestershire|Amberley]] in the County of Gloucester and of [[Ardsalla]] in the [[County Meath|County of Meath]], and in 1861. As a peer in his own right, he sat in the House of Lords for the remainder of his career.\n\n==Prime Minister again 1865–1866==\nWhen Palmerston suddenly died in late 1865, Russell again became [[Prime Minister]]. His second premiership was short and frustrating, and Russell failed in his great ambition of expanding the franchise - a task that would be left to his Conservative successors, Derby and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. In 1866, party disunity again brought down his government. Russell never again held any office. His last contribution to the House of Lords was on 3 August 1875.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/lord-john-russell/ Lord John Russell], [[Hansard]] search</ref>\n\n==Marriages and children==\n[[File:Lady John Russell.png|thumb|200px|Adelaide Lister, Russell's first wife (d. 1838)]]\nOn 11 April 1835, Russell married Adelaide, Lady Ribblesdale, the eldest daughter of Thomas Lister [[Esquire|Esq.]] and the widow of Thomas Lister, 2nd Baron Ribblesdale, who had died in 1832.<ref>Paul Scherer, ''Lord John Russell: A Biography''  (1999) pp 80-82</ref> Her death in 1838 cut the marriage short after three years. They had two daughters, Lady Georgiana Adelaide Russell (1836–1922), who married Archibald Peel  and had a daughter, Grace (1878–1973); and Lady Victoria Russell (1838–1880), who married the Rev. Henry Montagu Villiers, and left many descendants.<ref>Stuart J. Reid, '' Lord John Russell'' (1895)</ref>\n\nOn 20 July 1841 Russell married secondly Lady Frances Anna-Maria Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, daughter of [[Gilbert Elliot, 2nd Earl of Minto]]. Their children were [[John Russell, Viscount Amberley]] (1842–1876), George Gilbert William Russell (1848–1933); Francis Albert Rollo Russell (1849–1914) and Mary Augusta Russell (1853–1933). They lived at [[Pembroke Lodge]], [[Richmond Park]]<ref>Scherer, p 135</ref>\n\nAfter his 1876 death, Russell and his second wife brought up the children of his eldest son Lord Amberley, including philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], who recalled his grandfather in his later life as \"a kindly old man in a wheelchair\".<ref>Ronald Clark, ''The Life of Bertrand Russell'' (1978) ch 1</ref>\n\nThe 1st Earl Russell is buried at the 'Bedford Chapel' at [[St Michael's, Chenies|St. Michael’s Church]], Chenies.\n\n==Legacy==\nHe was succeeded as Liberal leader by former Peelite [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], and was thus the last true Whig to serve as Prime Minister. Generally taken as the model for [[Anthony Trollope]]'s [[List of fictional Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|Mr Mildmay]], aspects of his character may also have suggested those of [[Plantagenet Palliser]]. An ideal statesman, said Trollope, should have \"unblemished, unextinguishable, inexhaustible love of country...But he should also be scrupulous, and, as being scrupulous, weak.\"<ref>Quoted in Blair G. Kenney, \"Trollope's Ideal Statesmen: Plantagenet Palliser and Lord John Russell\" in ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Vol. 20, No. 3. (Dec., 1965), pp. 281-285.</ref>\n\nThe [[1832 Reform Act]] and extension of the franchise to British cities are partly attributed to his efforts.  He also worked for emancipation, leading the attack on the [[Test Act|Test]] and [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation acts]], which were repealed in 1828, as well as towards legislation limiting working hours in factories in the [[Factories Act 1847|1847 Factory Act]], and the [[Public Health Act 1848|Public Health Act of 1848]].\n\nHis government's approach to dealing with the Great Irish Famine is now widely condemned as counterproductive, ill-informed and disastrous. Russell himself was sympathetic to the plight of the Irish poor, and many of his relief proposals were blocked by his cabinet or by the British Parliament.<ref>Scherer, p 158</ref>\n\n[[Queen Victoria]]'s attitude to Russell had been coloured by his role in the Aberdeen administration.  On visiting [[Windsor Castle]] to resign, Aberdeen had told the Queen: \"Nothing could have been better\", he said, \"than the feeling of the members towards each other. Had it not been for the incessant attempts of Ld John Russell to keep up party differences, it must be acknowledged that the experiment of a coalition had succeeded admirably\", which attitude she shared.<ref>''Queen Victoria's Journals, Tuesday 30th January 1855, Windsor Castle, Princess Beatrice's copies'', Volume:39 (1 January 1855-30 June 1855), pp. 47-48, [http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/search/displayItem.do?FormatType=fulltextimgsrc&QueryType=articles&ResultsID=2738818125973&filterSequence=1&PageNumber=1&ItemNumber=7&ItemID=qvj08067&volumeType=PSBEA Online from the Bodleian Library]</ref>  The Queen continued to criticise Russell for his behaviour for the rest of his life, and on his death in 1878 her journal records that he was: \"A man of much talent, who leaves a name behind him, kind, & good, with a great knowledge of the constitution, who behaved very well, on many trying occasions; but he was impulsive, very selfish (as shown on many occasions, especially during Ld Aberdeen's administration) vain, & often reckless & imprudent\".<ref>''Queen Victoria's Journals, Wednesday 29th May 1878, Balmoral Castle, Princess Beatrice's copies'', Vol 68 (1 January 1878-24 June 1878), pp. 268-69, [http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/search/displayItem.do?FormatType=fulltextimgsrc&QueryType=articles&ResultsID=2738819292715&filterSequence=0&PageNumber=1&ItemNumber=9&ItemID=qvj16548&volumeType=PSBEA Online from the Bodleian Library]</ref>\n\n==Russell's governments==\n*[[First Russell ministry]] (July 1846–February 1852)\n*[[Second Russell ministry]] (October 1865–June 1866)\n\n==Literature==\nIn 1819 Lord John Russell published his book ''Life of Lord Russell'' about his famous ancestor; and a year later his ''Essays and Sketches of Life and Character'', \"By a Gentleman who has left his lodgings\" (1820), a series of social and cultural commentaries ostensibly found in a missing lodger's rooms.<ref>[Russell, Lord John].
