Wilks|Samuel Wilks]] and [[William Gemmell Cochran|William Cochran]]. After the war, he returned to Princeton, dividing his time between the university and [[Bell Labs|AT&T Bell Laboratories]].  He became a full professor at 35 and founding chairman of the Princeton statistics department in 1965.<ref name=NYTukey>{{cite news|last=Leonhardt|first=David|title=John Tukey, 85, Statistician; Coined the Word 'Software'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/28/us/john-tukey-85-statistician-coined-the-word-software.html|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=28 July 2000}}</ref>\n\nAmong many contributions to [[civil society]], Tukey served on a committee of the [[American Statistical Association]] that produced a report challenging the conclusions of the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey Report]], ''Statistical Problems of the Kinsey Report on Sexual Behavior in the Human Male''.\n\nHe was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] by President Nixon in 1973.<ref name=NYTukey/> He was awarded the [[IEEE Medal of Honor]] in 1982 \"For his contributions to the spectral analysis of random processes and the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) [[algorithm]].\"\n\nTukey retired in 1985. He died in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] on July 26, 2000.\n\n== Scientific contributions ==\n\nEarly in his career Tukey worked on developing statistical methods for computers at Bell Labs where he invented the term \"bit\".<ref>{{cite journal | title = Bell Systems Technical Journal | author = Claude Shannon | journal = Bell Systems Technical Journal |year=1948 }}</ref>\n\nHis [[statistics|statistical]] interests were many and varied. He is particularly remembered for his development with [[James Cooley]] of the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]]. In 1970, he contributed significantly to what is today known as the [[Resampling (statistics)#Jackknife|jackknife estimation]]—also termed Quenouille-Tukey jackknife. He introduced the [[box plot]] in his 1977 book, \"[[Exploratory Data Analysis]]\".\n\n[[Tukey's range test]], the [[Tukey lambda distribution]], [[Tukey's test of additivity]] and [[Tukey's lemma]] all bear his name. He is also the creator of several little-known methods such as the [[trimean]] and [[Median]]-[[Median line]], an easier alternative to [[linear regression]].\n\nIn 1974, he developed, with [[Jerome H. Friedman]], the concept of the [[projection pursuit]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = A Projection Pursuit Algorithm for Exploratory Data Analysis | author = J. H. Friedman and J. W.

Gordon -->offered the following summary of Tukey's principles for statistical practice:\n:... the usefulness and limitation of mathematical statistics; the importance of having methods of statistical analysis that are robust to violations of the assumptions underlying their use; the need to amass experience of the behaviour of specific methods of analysis in order to provide guidance on their use; the importance of allowing the possibility of data's influencing the choice of method by which they are analysed; the need for statisticians to reject the role of 'guardian of proven truth', and to resist attempts to provide once-for-all solutions and tidy over-unifications of the subject; the iterative nature of data analysis; implications of the increasing power, availability and cheapness of computing facilities; the training of statisticians.\n\n== Statistical terms ==\nTukey coined many statistical terms that have become part of common usage, but the two most famous coinages attributed to him were related to computer science.\n\nWhile working with [[John von Neumann]] on early computer designs, Tukey introduced the word \"[[bit]]\" as a contraction of \"binary digit\".<ref>[http://www.linfo.org/bit.html The origin of the 'bit']</ref> The term \"bit\" was first used in an article by [[Claude Shannon]] in 1948.\n\nIn 2000, Fred Shapiro, a librarian at the Yale Law School, published a letter revealing that Tukey's 1958 paper \"The Teaching of Concrete Mathematics\"<ref>J.W. Tukey, \"The Teaching of Concrete Mathematics,\" Amer. Mathematical Monthly, vol. 65, pp. 1–9, 1958: \"Today the \"software\" comprising the carefully planned interpretive routines, compilers, and other aspects of automative programming are at least as important to the modern electronic calculator as its \"hardware\" of tubes, transistors, wires, tapes, and the like.\"</ref> contained the earliest known usage of the term \"software\" found in a search of [[JSTOR]]'s electronic archives, predating the [[OED]]'s citation by two years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Fred|year=2000|title=Origin of the Term Software: Evidence from the JSTOR Electronic Journal Archive |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=69–71 |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030605004419/http://computer.org/annals/an2000/pdf/a2069.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2013 |doi=10.1109/mahc.2000.887997}}</ref> This led many to credit Tukey with coining the term, particularly in obituaries published that same year,<ref name=NYTukey/> although Tukey never claimed credit for any such coinage. In 1995, Paul Niquette claimed he had originally coined the term in October 1953, although he could not find any documents supporting his claim.<ref>Niquette, P. (2006) [http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/tocsoft.html Softword: Provenance for the Word 'Software']</ref> The earliest known publication of the term \"software\" in an engineering context was in August 1953 by Richard R. Carhart, in a Rand Corporation Research Memorandum.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carhart |first=Richard |title=A survey of the current status of the electronic reliability problem |url=http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2013/RM1131.pdf#79 |accessdate= |year=1953 |publisher=Rand Corporation |location=Santa Monica, CA |page=69 |quote=\"It will be recalled from Sec. 1.6 that the term ''personnel'' was defined to include people who come into direct contact with the hardware, from production to field use, i.e., people who assemble, inspect, pack, ship, handle, install, operate and maintain electronic equipment. In any of these phases personnel failures may result in unoperational gear. As with the hardware factors, there is almost no quantitative data concerning these software or human factors in reliability: How many faults are caused by personnel, why they occur, and what can be done to remove the errors.\"}}</ref>\n\n== Quotes ==\n* Doing statistics is like doing crosswords except that one cannot know for sure whether one has found the solution.<ref>{{cite journal | title = John W.
