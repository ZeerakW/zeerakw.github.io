The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary appellation ''Margittai'', meaning of [[Marghita]]. Neumann János became Margittai Neumann János (John Neumann of Marghita), which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann.\n\nHe was an extraordinary [[child prodigy]] in the areas of language, memorization, and mathematics.

Although his father insisted he attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas in which he had displayed an [[aptitude]]. At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst [[Gábor Szegő]].

In 1933, he was offered a position on the faculty of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] when the institute's plan to appoint [[Hermann Weyl]] fell through; von Neumann remained a mathematics professor there until his death. His mother and his brothers followed John to the United States; his father, Max Neumann, died in 1929. Von Neumann [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] his first name to John, keeping the German-aristocratic surname of von Neumann. In 1937, von Neumann became a  United States [[Naturalization#United States|naturalized citizen]] and immediately tried to enlist in the US Army Reserve but was rejected because of his age.<ref>''John von Neumann'', Norman Macrae, Random House, 1992</ref>  In 1938, he was awarded the [[Bôcher Memorial Prize]] for his work in analysis.\n\n===Set theory===\n{{See also|Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory#History}}\n\nThe axiomatization of mathematics, on the model of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', had reached new levels of rigour and breadth at the end of the 19th century, particularly in arithmetic, thanks to the [[Peano axioms|axiom schema]] of [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and geometry, thanks to [[David Hilbert]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on [[naive set theory]] suffered a setback due to [[Russell's paradox]] (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves).\n\nThe problem of an adequate axiomatization of [[set theory]] was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by [[Ernst Zermelo]] and [[Abraham Fraenkel]]. [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics. But they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the ''[[axiom of regularity|axiom of foundation]]'' and the notion of ''[[Class (set theory)|class]].''\n\n[[File:NeumannVonMargitta.jpg|thumb|350px|Excerpt from the university calendars for 1928 and 1928–1929 of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin]] announcing Neumann's lectures on axiomatic set theory and logics, problems in quantum mechanics and special mathematical functions. Notable colleagues were [[Georg Feigl]], [[Issai Schur]], [[Erhard Schmidt]], [[Leó Szilárd]], [[Heinz Hopf]], [[Adolf Hammerstein]] and [[Ludwig Bieberbach]].]]\nThe axiom of foundation established that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel, in such a manner that if one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession, hence excluding the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the ''method of [[inner model]]s'', which later became an essential instrument in set theory.\n\nThe second approach to the problem took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a ''proper class'' is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a ''proper class'' and not a set.\n\nWith this contribution of von Neumann, the axiomatic system of the theory of sets became fully satisfactory, and the next question was whether or not it was also definitive, and not subject to improvement. A strongly negative answer arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of [[Königsberg]], in which [[Kurt Gödel]] announced his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|first theorem of incompleteness]]: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. This result was sufficiently innovative as to confound the majority of mathematicians of the time.<ref name=\"John2005\">{{cite book|author=von Neumann, John |editor=Miklós Rédei|title=John von Neumann: Selected letters|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|series=History of Mathematics|volume=27|year=2005|page=123|isbn=0-8218-3776-1}}</ref>\n\nBut von Neumann, who had participated at the Congress, confirmed his fame as an instantaneous thinker, and in less than a month was able to communicate to Gödel himself an interesting consequence of his theorem: namely that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency.<ref name=\"John2005\" /> However, Gödel had already discovered this consequence, now known as his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|second incompleteness theorem]], and sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems. Von Neumann acknowledged Gödel's priority in his next letter.<ref>{{cite book|author=von Neumann, John |editor=Miklós Rédei|title=John von Neumann: Selected letters|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|series=History of Mathematics|volume=27|year=2005|page=124|isbn=0-8218-3776-1}} \"Many thanks for your letter and your reprint. As you have established the unprovability of consistency as a natural continuation and deepening of your earlier results, I clearly won't publish on this subject.\"</ref>\n\n===Geometry===\nVon Neumann founded the field of [[continuous geometry]]. It followed his path-breaking work on rings of operators. In mathematics, continuous geometry is an analogue of complex [[projective geometry]], where instead of the dimension of a subspace being in a discrete set 0, 1,&nbsp;..., ''n'', it can be an element of the unit interval [0,1]. Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of [[von Neumann algebra]]s with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions, and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the projections of the [[hyperfinite type II factor]].\n\n===Measure theory===\n{{See also|Lifting theory}}\n\nIn a series of famous papers, von Neumann made spectacular contributions to [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]].<ref name=\"measure\">{{cite journal|title=Von Neumann on measure and ergodic theory|author=[[Paul Halmos|Halmos, Paul R.]]|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|Bull.

Von Neumann's work argued that the \"problem is essentially group-theoretic in character, and that, in particular, for the solvability of the problem of measure the ordinary algebraic concept of solvability of a group is relevant. Thus, according to von Neumann, it is the change of group that makes a difference, not the change of space.\"\n\nIn a number of von Neumann's papers, the methods of argument he employed are considered even more significant than the results. In anticipation of his later study of dimension theory in algebras of operators, von Neumann used results on equivalence by finite decomposition, and reformulated the problem of measure in terms of functions (anticipating his later work, [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], on [[almost periodic function]]s).\n\nIn the 1936 paper on analytic measure theory, von Neumann used the [[Haar measure|Haar theorem]] in the solution of [[Hilbert's fifth problem]] in the case of compact groups.<ref name=\"measure\"/><ref>{{cite journal|first=J.|last=von Neumann|title=Die Einfuhrung Analytischer Parameter in Topologischen Gruppen|journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume=34|issue=1|series=2|year=1933|pages=170–179|doi=10.2307/1968347|jstor=1968347}}</ref>\n\n===Ergodic theory===\nVon Neumann made foundational contributions to [[ergodic theory]], in a series of articles published in 1932.<ref>Two famous papers are: {{cite journal|first=John|last=von Neumann|title=Proof of the Quasi-ergodic Hypothesis|year=1932|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=18|pages=70–82|doi=10.1073/pnas.18.1.70|pmid=16577432|issue=1|pmc=1076162|bibcode=1932PNAS...18...70N }}.\n{{cite journal|first=John|last=von Neumann|title=Physical Applications of the Ergodic Hypothesis|year=1932|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=18|pages=263–266|doi=10.1073/pnas.18.3.263|pmid=16587674|issue=3|pmc=1076204|jstor=86260|bibcode=1932PNAS...18..263N}}.\n{{cite journal|authorlink=Eberhard_Hopf|first=Eberhard|last=Hopf|title=Statistik der geodätischen Linien in Mannigfaltigkeiten negativer Krümmung|year=1939|journal=Leipzig Ber.

Von Neumann provided an abstract exploration of dimension in completed complemented modular topological lattices: \"Dimension is determined, up to a positive linear transformation, by the following two properties.

This conclusion is the culmination of 140 pages of brilliant and incisive algebra involving entirely novel axioms. Anyone wishing to get an unforgettable impression of the razor edge of von Neumann's mind, need merely try to pursue this chain of exact reasoning for himself—realizing that often five pages of it were written down before breakfast, seated at a living room writing-table in a bathrobe.\"<ref name=\"Garrett Birkhoff 1958, page 50-6\"/>\n\n===Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics===\n{{See also|von Neumann entropy|Density matrix|Quantum mutual information|Measurement in quantum mechanics#von Neumann measurement scheme|label 4 = von Neumann measurement scheme|Wave function collapse}}\n{{Quantum mechanics}}\n\nVon Neumann was the first to rigorously establish a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, known as the [[Dirac–von Neumann axioms]], with his 1932 work [[Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics]].\n\nAfter having completed the axiomatization of set theory, von Neumann began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He realized, in 1926, that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) [[Hilbert space]] that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. This is in contrast to a classical system where a state is represented by a point in a (real) phase space with 6N dimensions where N is the number of particles (3 [[generalized coordinates]] and 3 [[Conjugate momenta|conjugate generalized momenta]] for each particle). In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as [[linear operators]] acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system. The ''physics'' of quantum mechanics was thereby reduced to the ''mathematics'' of Hilbert spaces and linear operators acting on them.\n\nFor example, the [[uncertainty principle]], according to which the determination of the position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa, is translated into the ''non-commutativity'' of the two corresponding operators. This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the formulations of both Heisenberg and Schrödinger.\n\nVon Neumann's abstract treatment permitted him also to confront the foundational issue of determinism vs. non-determinism, and in the book he presented a proof that the statistical results of quantum mechanics could not possibly be averages of an underlying set of determined \"hidden variables,\" as in classical statistical mechanics. In 1966, John S. Bell published a paper arguing that the proof contained a conceptual error and was therefore invalid (see the article on [[John Stewart Bell]] for more information). However, in 2010, [[Jeffrey Bub]] argued that Bell had misconstrued von Neumann's proof, and pointed out that the proof, though not valid for all [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variable theories]], does rule out a well-defined and important subset.  Bub also suggests that von Neumann was aware of this limitation, and that von Neumann did not claim that his proof completely ruled out hidden variable theories.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Von Neumann's 'No Hidden Variables' Proof: A Re-Appraisal|year=2010|last1=Bub|first1=Jeffrey|journal=[[Foundations of Physics]] | volume=40 | issue=9–10 | pages=1333–1340 | bibcode=2010FoPh...40.1333B|doi=10.1007/s10701-010-9480-9|arxiv=1006.0499}}</ref> In any case, the proof inaugurated a line of research that ultimately led, through the work of Bell in 1964 on [[Bell's theorem]], and the experiments of [[Alain Aspect]] in 1982, to the demonstration that quantum physics either requires a ''notion of reality'' substantially different from that of classical physics, or must include [[quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] in apparent violation of special relativity.\n\nIn a chapter of ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', von Neumann deeply analyzed the so-called [[measurement problem]]. He concluded that the entire physical universe could be made subject to the universal [[wave function collapse|wave function]]. Since something \"outside the calculation\" was needed to collapse the wave function, von Neumann concluded that the collapse was caused by the consciousness of the experimenter (although this view was accepted by [[Eugene Wigner]], it never gained acceptance amongst the majority of physicists).<ref>von Neumann, John. (1932/1955). ''Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics''. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]]. Translated by Robert T. Beyer.</ref>\n\nThough theories of quantum mechanics continue to evolve to this day, there is a basic framework for the mathematical formalism of problems in quantum mechanics which underlies the majority of approaches and can be traced back to the mathematical formalisms and techniques first used by von Neumann. In other words, discussions about [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of the theory]], and extensions to it, are now mostly conducted on the basis of shared assumptions about the mathematical foundations.\n\n===Quantum logic===\n{{main|Quantum logic}}\n\nIn a famous paper of 1936 with [[Garrett Birkhoff]], the first work ever to introduce quantum logics,<ref>[[Dov Gabbay|Gabbay, Dov M.]] and Woods, John (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TNj1ZkP3qEC&pg=PA205 ''The Many Valued and Nonmonotonic Turn in Logic'']. [[Elsevier]]. pp. 205–217. ISBN 0444516239.</ref> von Neumann and Birkhoff first proved that quantum mechanics requires a propositional calculus substantially different from all classical logics and rigorously isolated a new algebraic structure for quantum logics. The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann's 1932 work, but in 1936, the need for the new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs. For example, photons cannot pass through two successive filters that are polarized perpendicularly (''e.g.'', one horizontally and the other vertically), and therefore, ''[[A fortiori argument|a fortiori]]'', it cannot pass if a third filter polarized diagonally is added to the other two, either before or after them in the succession, but if the third filter is added ''in between'' the other two, the photons will, indeed, pass through.  This experimental fact is translatable into logic as the ''non-commutativity'' of conjunction <math>(A\\land B)\\ne (B\\land A)</math>. It was also demonstrated that the laws of distribution of classical logic, <math>P\\lor(Q\\land R)=(P\\lor Q)\\land(P\\lor R)</math> and\n<math>P\\land (Q\\lor R)=(P\\land Q)\\lor(P\\land R)</math>, are not valid for quantum theory. The reason for this is that a quantum disjunction, unlike the case for classical disjunction, can be true even when both of the disjuncts are false and this is, in turn, attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case, in quantum mechanics, that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate, while each of its members are necessarily indeterminate. This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example. Suppose we are dealing with particles (such as electrons) of semi-integral spin (angular momentum) for which there are only two possible values: positive or negative. Then, a principle of indetermination establishes that the spin, relative to two different directions (e.g., ''x'' and ''y'') results in a pair of incompatible quantities. Suppose that the state '''ɸ''' of a certain electron verifies the proposition \"the spin of the electron in the ''x'' direction is positive.\" By the principle of indeterminacy, the value of the spin in the direction ''y'' will be completely indeterminate for '''ɸ'''. Hence, '''ɸ''' can verify neither the proposition \"the spin in the direction of ''y'' is positive\" nor\nthe proposition \"the spin in the direction of ''y'' is negative.\" Nevertheless, the disjunction of the propositions \"the spin in the direction of ''y'' is positive or the spin in the direction of ''y'' is negative\" must be true for '''ɸ'''.\nIn the case of distribution, it is therefore possible to have a situation in which ''<math>A \\land (B\\lor C)= A\\land 1 = A</math>'', while <math>(A\\land B)\\lor (A\\land C)=0\\lor 0=0</math>.\n\nVon Neumann proposes to replace classical logics with a logic constructed in orthomodular lattices (isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of the Hilbert space of a given physical system).<ref>''Philosophical Papers: Volume 3, Realism and Reason'', [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Cambridge University Press]], December 27, 1985, p. 263</ref>\n\n===Game theory===\nVon Neumann founded the field of [[game theory]] as a mathematical discipline.<ref name=\"KuhnTucker\">{{cite journal|author=Kuhn, H.

This theorem establishes that in [[zero-sum game]]s with [[perfect information]] (i.e. in which players know at each time all moves that have taken place so far), there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss.\n\nSuch strategies, which minimize the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players, publishing this result in his 1944 ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]]). The public interest in this work was such that ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] methods, especially [[convex set]]s and [[topology|topological]] [[fixed-point theorem]], rather than the traditional [[differential calculus]], because the [[Maxima and minima|maximum]]-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.\n\nIndependently, [[Leonid Kantorovich]]'s functional analytic work on mathematical economics also focused attention on optimization theory, non-differentiability, and [[Riesz space|vector lattices]]. Von Neumann's functional-analytic techniques—the use of [[Dual space|duality pairings]] of real [[vector space]]s to represent prices and quantities, the use of [[Supporting hyperplane|supporting]] and [[Hyperplane separation theorem|separating hyperplanes]] and convex set, and fixed-point theory—have been the primary tools of mathematical economics ever since.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blume|first=Lawrence&nbsp;E.|authorlink=Lawrence E.

Then it became a book.<ref>''John von Neumann'', Documentary film.</ref>\n\n===Mathematical economics===\nVon Neumann raised the intellectual and mathematical level of economics in several stunning publications. For his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]].<ref name=KuhnTucker/> Von Neumann's model of an expanding economy considered the [[Eigendecomposition of a matrix#Generalized eigenvalue problem|matrix pencil]]&nbsp;'' '''A'''&nbsp;−&nbsp;λ'''B''' '' with nonnegative matrices&nbsp;'''A''' and '''B'''; von Neumann sought [[probability vector|probability]] [[generalized eigenvector|vectors]]&nbsp;''p'' and&nbsp;''q'' and a positive number&nbsp;''λ'' that would solve the [[complementarity theory|complementarity]] equation\n:''p''<sup>T</sup>&nbsp;('''A''' − ''λ''&nbsp;'''B''')&nbsp;''q'' = 0,\nalong with two inequality systems expressing economic efficiency. In this model, the ([[transpose]]d) probability vector ''p'' represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the \"intensity\" at which the production process would run. The unique [[Eigendecomposition of a matrix#Generalized eigenvalue problem|solution]] ''λ'' represents the growth factor which is 1 plus the [[economic growth|rate of growth]] of the economy; the rate of growth equals the [[interest rate]]. Proving the existence of a positive growth rate and proving that the growth rate equals the interest rate were remarkable achievements, even for von Neumann.<ref>For this problem to have a unique solution, it suffices that the nonnegative matrices&nbsp;'''A''' and&nbsp;'''B''' satisfy an [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|irreducibility condition]], generalizing that of the [[Perron–Frobenius theorem]] of nonnegative matrices, which considers the (simplified) [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue problem]]\n: '''A''' − λ '''I''' ''q'' = 0,\nwhere the nonnegative matrix''&nbsp;'''A''''' must be square and where the [[diagonal matrix]]''&nbsp;'''I''' ''is the [[identity matrix]]. Von Neumann's irreducibility condition was called the \"whales and [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wranglers]]\" hypothesis by David Champernowne, who provided a verbal and economic commentary on the English translation of von Neumann's article. Von Neumann's hypothesis implied that every economic process used a positive amount of every economic good.

Arrow and Debreu also used linear programming, as did Nobel laureates [[Tjalling Koopmans]], [[Leonid Kantorovich]], [[Wassily Leontief]], [[Paul Samuelson]], [[Robert Dorfman]], [[Robert Solow]], and [[Leonid Hurwicz]].\n\n[[Norman Macrae]] has traced the origins of von Neumann's famous 9-page paper. It started life as a talk at Princeton and then became a paper in Germany, which was eventually translated into English. His interest in economics that led to that paper began as follows: When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929 he spent his summers back home in Budapest, and so did the economist [[Nicholas Kaldor]], and they hit it off. Kaldor recommended that von Neumann read a book by the mathematical economist [[Léon Walras]]. Von Neumann found some faults in that book and corrected them, for example, replacing equations by inequalities. He noticed that Walras's [[General Equilibrium Theory]] and [[Walras' Law]], which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations, could produce the absurd result that the profit could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product. He replaced the equations by inequalities, introduced dynamic equilibria, among other things, and eventually produced his 9-page paper.<ref>[[#MacRae|MacRae]]</ref>\n\n===Linear programming===\nBuilding on his results on matrix games and on his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann invented the theory of duality in linear programming, after [[George Dantzig]] described his work in a few minutes, when an impatient von Neumann asked him to get to the point. Then, Dantzig listened dumbfounded while von Neumann provided an hour lecture on convex sets, fixed-point theory, and duality, conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming.<ref name=\"George B 2003\">Dantzig, George B. and Thapa, Mukund N.

Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices, with the pivoting decision determined by a nonnegative [[least squares]] subproblem with a convexity constraint ([[Projection (linear algebra)#Orthogonal projections|projecting]] the zero-vector onto the [[convex hull]] of the active [[simplex]]).

During this period von Neumann was the leading authority of the mathematics of [[shaped charge]]s. This led him to a large number of military consultancies, primarily for the Navy, which in turn led to his involvement in the [[Manhattan Project]]. The involvement included frequent trips by train to the project's secret research facilities in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos, New Mexico]].<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nVon Neumann's principal contribution to the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] was in the concept and design of the [[nuclear weapon design|explosive lenses]] needed to compress the [[plutonium]] core of the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] device and the \"[[Fat Man]]\" weapon that was later dropped on [[Nagasaki]]. While von Neumann did not originate the \"[[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion]]\" concept, he was one of its most persistent proponents, encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues, who felt such a design to be unworkable. He also eventually came up with the idea of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of \"assembly\" (compression).\n\nWhen it turned out that there would not be enough [[uranium-235]] to make more than one bomb, the implosive lens project was greatly expanded and von Neumann's idea was implemented. Implosion was the only method that could be used with the [[plutonium-239]] that was available from the [[Hanford Site]]. His calculations showed that implosion would work if it did not depart by more than 5% from spherical symmetry. After a series of failed attempts with models, 5% was achieved by [[George Kistiakowsky]], and the construction of the Trinity bomb was completed in July 1945.\n\nIn a visit to Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the pressure increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90° and some limiting angle. As a result, it was determined that the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than at ground level.<ref name=\"Critical Assembly\">{{cite book|title=Critical Assembly: A Technical History of Los Alamos during the Oppenheimer Years, 1943–1945|coauthors=Paul W.

Based on his observation alone, von Neumann estimated the test had resulted in a blast equivalent to 5 [[ton|kilotons]] of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]], but [[Enrico Fermi]] produced a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping scraps of torn-up paper as the shock wave passed his location and watching how far they scattered.

He then collaborated with [[Klaus Fuchs]] on further development of the bomb, and in 1946 the two filed a secret patent on \"Improvement in Methods and Means for Utilizing Nuclear Energy\", which outlined a scheme for using a fission bomb to compress fusion fuel to initiate [[nuclear fusion]].<ref>{{cite book|ref=Herken|last=Herken|first=Gregg|title=Brotherhood of the Bomb: The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, and Edward Teller|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8050-6588-6|pages=171, 374}}</ref> The Fuchs–von Neumann patent used [[radiation implosion]], but not in the same way as is used in what became the final hydrogen bomb design, the Teller–Ulam design.

The historian [[Jeremy Bernstein]] has pointed out that ironically, \"John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs, produced a brilliant invention in 1946 that could have changed the whole course of the development of the hydrogen bomb, but was not fully understood until after the bomb had been successfully made.\"<ref name=\"Bernstein2010\" />\n\n===The Atomic Energy Committee===\nIn 1954 von Neumann was invited to become a member of the Atomic Energy Committee. He accepted this position and used it to further the production of compact H-bombs suitable for [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] delivery. He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of [[tritium]] and [[lithium 6]] needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against settling for the intermediate range missiles that the Army wanted. He was adamant that H-bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible, and that the relative inaccuracy of the missile wouldn't be a problem with an H-bomb. He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system, which turned out to be the case.<ref>[[#Heims|Heims]], p. 276</ref>\n\n===The ICBM Committee===\nIn 1955, von Neumann became a commissioner of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|United States Atomic Energy Program]]. Shortly before his death, when he was already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) committee, and it would sometimes meet in his home. Its purpose was to decide on the feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The [[SM-65 Atlas]] passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.\n\n===Mutual assured destruction===\nJohn von Neumann is credited with the equilibrium strategy of [[mutual assured destruction]], providing the deliberately humorous acronym, MAD. (Other humorous acronyms coined by von Neumann include his computer, the [[MANIAC I|Mathematical Analyzer, Numerical Integrator, and Computer]]—or MANIAC). He also \"moved heaven and earth\" to bring MAD about. His goal was to quickly develop ICBMs and the compact hydrogen bombs that they could deliver to the USSR, and he knew the Soviets were doing similar work because the [[CIA]] interviewed German rocket scientists who were allowed to return to Germany, and von Neumann had planted a dozen technical people in the CIA. The Russians believed that bombers would soon be vulnerable, and they shared von Neumann's view that an H-bomb in an ICBM was the [[ne plus ultra]] of weapons, and they believed that whoever had superiority in these weapons would take over the world, without necessarily using them.<ref>[[#MacRae|MacRae]], pp. 362–363</ref>  von Neumann was afraid of a \"missile gap\" and took several more steps to achieve his goal of keeping up with the Soviets:\n*He modified the ENIAC by making it programmable and then wrote programs for it to do the H-bomb calculations verifying that the Teller-Ulam design was feasible and to develop it further.\n*He became a member of the Atomic Energy Committee to speed up the development of a compact H-bomb that would fit in an ICBM. \n*He personally interceded to speed up the production of lithium-6 and tritium needed for the compact bombs.\n*He caused several separate missile projects to be started, because he felt that competition combined with collaboration got the best results.<ref>[[#Heims|Heims]], pp. 258–260</ref>\n\n===Computing===\n[[File:Nobili Pesavento 2reps.png|right|thumb|400px|The first implementation of von Neumann's self-reproducing universal constructor.<ref name=Pesavento1995>{{cite journal|journal=[[Artificial Life (journal)|Artificial Life]]| title=An implementation of von Neumann's self-reproducing machine|year=1995|first=Umberto|last=Pesavento|volume=2|issue=4|pages=337–354|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418081628/http://dragonfly.tam.cornell.edu/~pesavent/pesavento_self_reproducing_machine.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1162/artl.1995.2.337|pmid=8942052}}</ref> Three generations of machine are shown, the second has nearly finished constructing the third.

During this time he contributed to the development of the [[Monte Carlo method]], which allowed solutions to complicated problems to be approximated using [[Algorithmically random sequence|random numbers]]. He was also involved in the design of the later [[IAS machine]].\n\nBecause using lists of \"truly\" random numbers was extremely slow, von Neumann developed a form of making [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandom numbers]], using the [[middle-square method]]. Though this method has been criticized as crude, von Neumann was aware of this: he justified it as being faster than any other method at his disposal, and also noted that when it went awry it did so obviously, unlike methods which could be subtly incorrect.\n\nWhile consulting for the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] on the [[EDVAC]] project, von Neumann wrote an incomplete ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]''. The paper, whose premature distribution nullified the patent claims of EDVAC designers [[J. Presper Eckert]] and [[John Mauchly]], described a [[computer architecture]] in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer's memory in the same address space.<ref name=\"ENIAC museum\">The name for the architecture is discussed in [http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/mauchly/jwm9.html John W.

Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly, inventors of the [[ENIAC]] computer at the University of Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"ENIAC museum\"/>\n\nJohn von Neumann also consulted for the ENIAC project.  The electronics of the new ENIAC ran at one-sixth the speed,<!-- compared to what? --> but this in no way degraded the ENIAC's performance, since it was still entirely [[I/O bound]]. Complicated programs could be developed and [[Debugging|debugged]] in days rather than the weeks required for plugboarding the old ENIAC.  Some of von Neumann's early computer programs have been preserved.<ref>''Selected Papers on Computer Science (Center for the Study of Language and Information – Lecture Notes)'' by Donald E. Knuth (November 15, 2004)</ref>\n\nThe next computer that von Neumann designed was the [[IAS machine]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey. He arranged its financing, and the components were designed and built at the [[Sarnoff Corporation|RCA Research Laboratory]] nearby. John von Neumann recommended that the [[IBM 701]], nicknamed ''the defense computer'' include a magnetic drum. It was a faster version of the IAS machine and formed the basis for the commercially successful IBM 704.<ref>Rédei, Miklós (ed.) (2005) ''John von Neumann: Selected Letters''.

For example, with [[Robert D. Richtmyer]] he developed an algorithm defining ''artificial [[viscosity]]'' that improved the understanding of [[shock wave]]s. It is possible that we would not understand much of astrophysics, and might not have highly developed [[Jet engine|jet]] and [[rocket engine]]s without the work of von Neumann.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nA problem was that when computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of ''artificial viscosity'' smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics.\n\nOther well known contributions to fluid dynamics included the classic flow solution to [[blast wave]]s,<ref>Neumann, John von, \"The Point Source Solution,\" John von Neumann.

He was a frequent consultant for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[United States Army]], the [[RAND Corporation]], [[Standard Oil]], [[General Electric]], [[IBM]], and others.\n\nThroughout his life, von Neumann had a respect and admiration for business and government leaders, something that was often at variance with the inclinations of his scientific colleagues.<ref>Mathematical Association of American documentary, especially comments by Morgenstern regarding this aspect of von Neumann's personality</ref> Von Neumann entered government service (Manhattan Project) primarily because he felt that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, it would have to be because the US would triumph over totalitarianism from [[Nazism]], [[Fascism]] and [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communism]].<ref name=\"whitman\">{{cite web|url=http://256.com/gray/docs/misc/conversation_with_marina_whitman.shtml|title=Conversation with Marina Whitman|publisher=Gray Watson (256.com)|accessdate=January 30, 2011|ref=whiteman}}</ref>\n\nAs president of the von Neumann Committee for Missiles, and later as a member of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], from 1953 until his death in 1957, he was influential in setting US scientific and military policy.

He said the Roman Empire was purely defensive in the early days and only became imperialistic towards the end.\nHe also said that it would not be profitable for the US to sell arms to combatants, because such sales are usually on credit, and such debts are never paid.
