He published ''The English Income Tax with Special Reference to Administration and Method of Assessment'' (1899).\n\nIn 1898 he took on statistical work for the [[United States Census Bureau]], of which he became chief statistician in 1909. In this connection he had charge of [[census]] reports on [[child labor]], [[illiterate|illiteracy]], [[marriage]] and [[divorce]], women at work, and a report for the [[Immigration Commission]] on occupations of immigrants. He was the author of many census reports on child labor, the insane, divorce, and kindred subjects.   He was appointed Assistant Director of the Census in 1921.\n\nAlthough revised by [[Edward Vermilye Huntington]], Hill is credited with the conception of the '''Method of Equal Proportions''' or [[Huntington-Hill method]] of [[Congressional apportionment|apportionment]] of seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] to the states, as a function of their populations determined in the [[U.S. census]][http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/apportion2.html].  This mathematical algorithm has been used in the U.S. since 1941 and is currently the method used.<ref>https://www.census.gov/history/www/census_then_now/notable_alumni/joseph_adna_hill.html</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Hill, Joseph Adna\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1860\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 1938\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hill, Joseph Adna}}\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:1860 births]]\n[[Category:1938 deaths]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:People from Coos County, New Hampshire]]\n\n\n{{US-statistician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Joseph Adna Hill"}}}}
