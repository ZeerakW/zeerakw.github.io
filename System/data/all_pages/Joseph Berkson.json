Whereas the classical error model is statistically independent of the true variable, Berkson's model is statistically independent of the observed variable.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Heid IM, Kuchenhoff H, Miles J, Kreienbrock L, Wichmann HE|title=Two dimensions of measurement error: Classical and Berkson error in residential radon exposure assessment|journal=J Exp Anal and Env Epi|year=2004|volume=14|pages=365–377|url=http://www.nature.com/jea/journal/v14/n5/abs/7500332a.html|doi=10.1038/sj.jea.7500332|pmid=15361895|issue=5}}</ref> Carroll et al.
