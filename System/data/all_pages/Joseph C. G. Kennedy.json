Initially a prosperous farmer and journalist from a prominent Pennsylvania family, Kennedy was appointed to supervise the Census because of his political activism in the 1848 Pennsylvania election.<ref name=bio>{{cite book|author=James Terry White|title=The National cyclopaedia of American biography: being the history of the United States as illustrated in the lives of the founders, builders, and defenders of the republic, and of the men and women who are doing the work and moulding the thought of the present time|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3B_YAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 September 2011|year=1967|publisher=J.

He was also responsible for supervising the ultimate compilation of census data, tabulation of statistics, and publication of census summaries.\n\nThe Seventh Census of the United States (1850) was taken 1 June 1850. This was the first year in which the census bureau attempted to count every member of every household, including women, children and slaves. Accordingly, the first [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] schedules were produced in 1850. Prior to 1850, census records had only recorded the name of the head of the household and broad statistical accounting of other household members, (three children under age five, one woman between the age of 35 and 40, etc.)..\n\nThe Eighth Census of the United States (1860) estimated the population of the United States at 31,400,000.  This was the first census where American Indians were officially counted, but only those who had 'renounced tribal rules'. That figure for the nation was 40,000.  Results of this census were tabulated by 184 clerks in the [[Bureau of the Census]].\n\nHowever, by the time the 1860 census returns were ready for tabulation, the United States was moving toward the [[American Civil War]]. As a result, Superintendent Kennedy and his staff produced only an abbreviated set of reports, which included no graphic or cartographic representations.  As the war began, however, Kennedy and the Census staff used the new statistics to produce maps of Southern states for Union field commanders.  These maps displayed militarily vital topics, including white population, slave population, predominant agricultural products (by county), and rail and post-road transportation routes.\n\n== Publications ==\n* ''Agriculture of the United States in 1860; Compiled from the Original Returns of the Eighth Census, Under the Direction of the Secretary of the Interior.''
