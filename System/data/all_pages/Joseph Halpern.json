Most of his research is on reasoning about knowledge and uncertainty.\n\nHalpern graduated in 1975 from [[University of Toronto]] with a B.S. in mathematics. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics from [[Harvard University]] in 1981 under the supervision of [[Albert R. Meyer]] and [[Gerald Sacks]]. He has written two books, ''Reasoning about Uncertainty'' and ''Reasoning About Knowledge'' and is a winner of the 1997 [[Gödel Prize]] in theoretical computer science and the 2009 [[Dijkstra Prize]] in distributed computing. From 1997 to 2003 he was editor-in-chief of the [[Journal of the ACM]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = History {{!}} Journal of the ACM|url = http://jacm.acm.org/history|website = jacm.acm.org|accessdate = 2015-08-13}}</ref> In 2002 he was inducted as a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] and in 2012 he was selected as an [[IEEE Fellow]].<ref>[http://www.ieee.org/documents/fellows_class_2012.pdf 2012 Newly Elevated Fellows], IEEE, accessed 2011-12-10.</ref>\nIn 2011 he was awarded a Senior Fellowship of the Zukunftskolleg at the [[University of Konstanz]].<ref>https://www.zukunftskolleg.uni-konstanz.de/people/personen-details/halpern-joseph-y-1187/6338/13775/</ref>\n\nHalpern is also the administrator for the Computing Research Repository, the computer science branch of [[arXiv.org]], and the moderator for the \"general literature\" and \"other\" subsections of the repository.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses Subject areas and moderators], [[arxiv.org]].</ref>\n\nHis students include [[Nir Friedman]], [[Daphne Koller]], and [[Yoram Moses]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n<!--\nIn a debate with [[Peter Cheeseman]] (see \"In Defense of Probability\"), where Cheeseman advocated the view that probability theory was sufficient for the task of reasoning with uncertainty, Halpern defended a non-normative view (see \"Let Many Flowers Bloom\"). -->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/ Joe Halpern's homepage]\n*[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FsBCAfgAAAAJ Google scholar profile]\n\n{{Gödel winners}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata         <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n| NAME              =Halpern, Joseph\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American computer scientist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1953\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Halpern, Joseph}}\n[[Category:Cornell University faculty]]\n[[Category:Gödel Prize laureates]]\n[[Category:Dijkstra Prize laureates]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery]]\n[[Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE]]\n[[Category:American computer scientists]]\n[[Category:Researchers in distributed computing]]\n[[Category:University of Toronto alumni]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Artificial intelligence researchers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]\n[[Category:1953 births]]\n\n\n{{Compu-bio-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Joseph Halpern"}}}}
