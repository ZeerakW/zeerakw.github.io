Hilbe studied for his doctorate in philosophy at [[U.C.L.A.]] where he was a graduate reader for visiting professor and [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Friedrich Hayek|Fredrick von Hayek]] and personal assistant to [[Rudolf Carnap]], one of the founders of the [[Vienna Circle]] of [[Logical Positivism]].<ref name=\"google.com\"/>\n\nHilbe secured a position at the [[University of Hawaii]], where he retired as an emeritus professor of\nphilosophy in 1990. During this time he authored several texts in philosophy and logic. In 1988 he earned\na doctorate in [[statistics]] ([[applied mathematics]], [[U.C.L.A.]]) and in 1990 was hired\nby [[Health Care Financing Administration|HCFA]] to develop statistical and data management tools for\nthe study of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] data.<ref name=\"google.com\"/> Hilbe served as the founding\neditor of the ''Stata Technical Bulletin'' (predecessor to ''[[Statacorp|The Stata Journal]]'') from 1991 to\n1993,<ref>[http://www.statajournal.com/sjfaq.html ''The Stata Journal'' FAQ<!-- Bot generated\ntitle -->]</ref> for which he developed a variety of statistical software commands, including the first\n[[generalized linear models]] (GLM) program having a [[negative binomial|negative binomial regression]]\nfamily (1993). The negative binomial family is now incorporated into the GLM routines of all major commercial\nstatistical software. Hilbe is regarded as having popularized negative binomial regression, particularly\nin the disciplines of biostatistics and health outcomes analysis. It is now a standard method used for\nmodeling overdispersed count data. Hilbe's 2007 text, ''Negative Binomial Regression'', was the first\ntext specifically devoted to the model and its many variations. His 2014 ''Modeling Count Data'' is regarded as the first text on applied count models.\n\nIn 1992 Hilbe was appointed as an Adjunct Professor of [[Statistics]] in the Department of [[Sociology]] at [[Arizona State University]], [[Tempe, AZ]]. In 2007 the Sociology department merged with several other departments to become the\n''School of Social and Family Dynamics''.<ref>[http://ssfd.clas.asu.edu/hilbe]</ref> Hilbe served in several corporate positions during the 1990s,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[https://profiles.google.com/j.m.hilbe#j.m.hilbe]</ref>\nincluding the positions of lead statistician for Genentech's\nnoted ''National Registry for Myocardial Infarctions'' (NRMI-2;1996–97)<ref>[http://pubget.com/search?q=Hilbe%3A+%22NRMI-2%22]</ref> and lead statistician\nfor Hoffman-La Roche's ''Canadian National Registry for Cardiovascular Disease''\n(FASTRAK;1997–99).<ref name=\"google.com\"/><ref>[http://pubget.com/search?q=Hilbe%3A%22+FASTRAK+II+Network%22]</ref>  During this period Hilbe played an important role in the formation of the ''Health Policy Statistics Section'' of\nthe [[American Statistical Association]], serving as a member of its initial executive\ncommittee <ref>http://www.amstat-online.org/sections/hpss/history.htm</ref> and as a member of the founding scientific organizing committee (1995) for\nthe ''International Conferences on Health Policy Statistics'' (ICHPS),<ref>[http://www.amstat-online.org/sections/hpss/history.htm]</ref> which has been\ncontinuously held on a biannual basis. Hilbe was also one of the longest serving editors for a publication of the [[American Statistical Association]], holding the position of Software Reviews Editor for [[The American Statistician]] for twelve years from 1997 to 2009.<ref>\n[http://www.amstat.org/publications/tas/index.cfm?fuseaction=board The American Statistician<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nHilbe's long-term interest in astronomy and meteorites led to his selection in 2006 as a ''Solar System Ambassador'' with\n[[NASA]] / [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[California Institute of Technology]]\nin [[Pasadena, CA]]<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www2,jpl.nasa.gov/ambassador/profiles/Joseph_Hilbe.htm The Solar System Ambassadors  Program<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> commencing January 2007. In 2008 Hilbe initiated the International Statistical Institute's (ISI)\n''Astrostatistics Interest Group''. In December 2009, the ISI Council approved the creation of an astrostatistics committee and network with Hilbe\nas inaugural chair.<ref>http://isi-web.org/com/ast</ref> It was the first such interest-working group or committee authorized under the auspices of\nan astronomical of statistical organization. In August 2012 the [[International Astrostatistics Association]] (IAA) was formed with\nHilbe elected as its founding President. The IAA is the first worldwide professional association for astrostatisticians. Its goal is to enhance\ncollaboration between astrophysists, statisticians, and computer-information scientists, with an aim of enabling researchers to better\nunderstand and interpret astronomical data.<ref>[https://asaip.psu.edu/organizations/iaa/international-astrostatistics-association- overview/view]</ref>\nIn 2012, the Network and IAA stimulated the creation of the first working groups in astrostatistics and astroinformations within both the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and International Astronomical Union (IAU), with Hilbe as an initial member in both. Hilbe was also on the scientific organizing committee of the first IAU symposium on astrostatistics, ''Statistical Challenges in 21st Century Cosmology'',  held in May 2013 in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nIn 2009 Hilbe received the Distinguished Alumnus award from [[California State University, Chico]].\n<ref>[http://www.csuchico.edu/hfa/alumni/distinguished/2009.shtml]</ref> Two years before he was inducted into\nthe ''Chico State Athletic Hall of Fame''.<ref>[http://www.csuchico.edu/athletics/hof/2007hof.html]</ref> He is\nthe only graduate of the university to receive both awards.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n<ref>[http://www.csuchico.edu/athletics/hof/2007hof.html 2007 Hall of Fame Inductees<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\nIn 2010 Hilbe was inducted into the ''Paradise High School Athletic Hall of Fame'', and in 2011 was inducted into the ''Woodside Priory High School Athletic Hall of Fame''.

Hilbe set Hawaii state records in\nthe 100 meters (10.40, 1973) and the Javelin (78.51/257'7\", 1976), which is still the recognized state mark. Hilbe served as National Chair for AAU Girl's [[AAU Junior Olympic Games|Junior Olympic]] Track & Field from 1979 to 1982, and was Head Women's Track & Field coach at the [[University of Hawaii]] from 1979 to 1985. <ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> His foremost athletes were Gwen Loud, 1984 [[NCAA]] Division 1 Long Jump Champion (6.72/22'5¾\") and a member of the U.S. team to the first [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) World Championships in Helsinki, 1983, and Gwen Gardner, second at the 1980 U.S. Olympic Trials 400 meters, earning a berth on the Olympic team that boycotted the [[Moscow Olympic Games]].  As assistant men's coach at the [[University of Hawaii]] (1973–1977), Hilbe coached [[Terry Albritton]], who broke the Shot Put world record (21.85/71'8½\") in 1976, and won numerous AAU and NCAA titles. Hilbe was elected to serve as a U.S. team coach and manager during the 1980s for several major competitions in the U.S., Australia/New Zealand, the Caribbean, and in Europe.\n\nHilbe was a member of the founding committee that formed the National Track & Field Officials\nAssociation in 1977.
