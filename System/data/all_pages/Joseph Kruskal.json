He was a student at the [[University of Chicago]] earing a bachelor of science in mathematics in the year of 1948 ,and a master of science in mathematics in the following year 1949.<ref>{{cite web|author1=J J O'Connor|author2=E F Robertson|title=Kruskal Joseph biography - University of St Andrews|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Kruskal_Joseph.html|website=University of St Andrews|accessdate=2 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707154900/http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Kruskal_Joseph.html|archivedate=7 July 2015|language=English|quote=He was awarded a BS in 1948 and an MS in 1949 by Chicago.}}</ref> After his time at the University of Chicago Kruskal attended [[Princeton University]], where he completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1954, nominally under [[Albert W. Tucker]] and [[Roger Lyndon]], but de facto under [[Paul Erdős]] with whom he had two very short conversations.<ref>http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/11/reflection-on-old-days-by-joseph.html</ref> Kruskal has worked on [[well-quasi-ordering]]s and [[multidimensional scaling]]. \n\nHe was a Fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]], former president of the [[Psychometric Society]], and former president of the [[Classification Society of North America]]. He also initiated and was first president of the Fair Housing Council of [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] and [[Maplewood, New Jersey|Maplewood]] in 1963, and actively supported civil rights in several other organizations such as [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]].<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/nars/orallist.htm Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement]</ref>\n\nIn statistics, Kruskal's most influential work is his seminal contribution to the formulation of [[multidimensional scaling]]. In computer science, his best known work is [[Kruskal's algorithm]] for computing the [[minimal spanning tree]] (MST) of a [[weighted graph]]. The algorithm first orders the edges by weight and then proceeds through the ordered list adding an edge to the partial MST provided that adding the new edge does not create a cycle. Minimal spanning trees have applications to the construction and pricing of communication networks.  In combinatorics, he is known for [[Kruskal's tree theorem]] (1960), which is also interesting from a [[mathematical logic]] perspective since it can only be proved nonconstructively.   Kruskal also applied his work in linguistics, in an experimental [[lexicostatistics|lexicostatistical]] study of [[Indo-European]] languages, together with the linguists [[Isidore Dyen]] and Paul Black.  Their database is still widely used (available at the link below). \n\nKruskal was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref>[http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/1972_24_01_00_brown.pdf American Jewish Archives: \"Two Baltic Families Who Came to America The Jacobsons and the Kruskals, 1870-1970\" by RICHARD D.

Kruskal, Sr.  His mother, [[Lillian Rose Vorhaus Kruskal Oppenheimer]], became a noted promoter of [[Origami]] during the early era of television.
