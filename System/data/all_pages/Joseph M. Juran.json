Juran]].\n\n==Early life==\nJuran was born in [[Brăila]], [[Romania]], one of the six children born to a Jewish couple, Jakob and Gitel Juran; they later lived in [[Gura Humorului]]. He had three sisters: Rebecca (nicknamed Betty), Minerva, who earned a doctoral degree and had a career in education, and Charlotte. He had two brothers: [[Nathan H. Juran]] and Rudolph, known as Rudy. Rudy founded a municipal bond company<ref name=autobio>{{Citation | last = Juran | first = Joseph M. | publication-date = 2004 | title = Architect of Quality: The Autobiography of Dr. Joseph M.

Juran excelled in school, especially in [[mathematics]]. He was a [[chess]] champion at an early age,<ref>{{Citation | title= Joseph Juran, 103, Pioneer in Quality Control, Dies | newspaper= [[New York Times]] | date= 2008-03-03 | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/business/03juran.html | accessdate = 2008-06-01 | quote = He earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, where he was a chess champion | first=Nick | last=Bunkley}}</ref> and dominated chess at [[Western Electric]]. Juran graduated from [[Minneapolis South High School]] in 1920.\n\nIn 1924, with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[University of Minnesota]], Juran joined Western Electric's [[Hawthorne Works]]. His first job was [[troubleshooting]] in the Complaint Department.<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|79}}  In 1925, [[Bell Labs]] proposed that Hawthorne Works personnel be trained in its newly developed [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sampling]] and [[control chart]] techniques.  Juran was chosen to join the Inspection Statistical Department, a small group of engineers charged with applying and disseminating Bell Labs' statistical [[quality control]] innovations.  This highly visible position fueled Juran's rapid ascent in the organization and the course of his later career.<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|110}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1926, he married Sadie Shapiro. Joseph and Sadie met in 1924 when his sister Betty moved to Chicago and he and Sadie met her [on the] train; in his autobiography he wrote of meeting Sadie \"There and then I was smitten and have remained so ever since\". They were engaged in 1925 on Joseph's 21st birthday. 15 months later they were married. They had been married for nearly 82 years when he died in 2008.\n\nJoseph and Sadie raised four children (3 sons and 1 daughter.) Robert, Sylvia, Charles, and Donald. Robert was an award-winning newspaper editor, and Sylvia earned a doctorate in Russian literature.\n\n==Department chief==\nJuran was promoted to department chief in 1928, and the following year became a division chief. He published his first quality-related article in ''Mechanical Engineering'' in 1935. In 1937, he moved to Western Electric/[[AT&T]]'s headquarters in [[New York City]], where he held the position of Chief Industrial Engineer.\n\nAs a hedge against the uncertainties of the [[Great Depression]], he enrolled in [[Loyola University Chicago School of Law]] in 1931. He graduated in 1935 and was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the Illinois]] bar in 1936, though he never practiced law.<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|142}}\n\nDuring [[World War II|the Second World War]], through an arrangement with his employer, Juran served in the [[Lend-Lease]] Administration and [[Foreign Economic Administration]]. Just before war's end, he resigned from Western Electric, and his government post, intending to become a freelance consultant.<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|204–205}}\n\nHe soon joined the faculty of [[New York University]] as an adjunct professor in the Department of [[Industrial Engineering]], where he taught courses in quality control and ran [[round table]] seminars for executives. He also worked through a small [[management consulting]] firm on projects for [[Global Gillette|Gilette]], [[Hamilton Watch Company]] and [[Borg-Warner]]. After the firm's owner's sudden death, Juran began his own independent practice, from which he made a comfortable living until his retirement in the late 1990s. His early clients included the now defunct Bigelow-Sanford Carpet Company, the [[Koppers]] Company, the [[ILC Dover|International Latex Company]], [[Bausch & Lomb]] and [[General Foods]].\n\n==Japan==\nThe end of World War II compelled [[Japan]] to change its focus from becoming a military power to becoming an economic one.  Despite Japan's ability to compete on price, its consumer goods manufacturers suffered from a long-established reputation of poor quality. The first edition of Juran's ''Quality Control Handbook'' in 1951 attracted the attention of the [[Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers]] (JUSE), which invited him to Japan in 1952. When he finally arrived in Japan in 1954, Juran met with ten manufacturing companies, notably [[Showa Denko]], [[Nippon Kōgaku]], [[Noritake]], and [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company]].<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|250–257}} He also lectured at [[Hakone]], [[Waseda University]], [[Ōsaka]], and [[Kōyasan]].  During his life, he made ten visits to Japan, the last in 1990.\n\nWorking independently of [[W. Edwards Deming]] (who focused on the use of [[statistical process control]]), Juran—who focused on managing for quality—went to Japan and started courses (1954) in quality management. The training started with top and middle management. The idea that top and [[middle management]] needed training had found resistance in the United States. For Japan, it would take some 20 years for the training to pay off.{{synthesis-inline|date=June 2012}} In the 1970s, Japanese products began to be seen as the leaders in quality. This sparked a crisis in the United States due to quality issues in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==Contributions==\n\n===Pareto principle===\nIn 1941, Juran stumbled across the work of [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and began to apply the [[Pareto principle]] to quality issues (for example, 80% of a problem is caused by 20% of the causes). This is also known as \"the vital few and the trivial many\". In later years, Juran preferred \"the vital few and the useful many\" to signal the remaining 80% of the causes should not be totally ignored.\n\n===Management theory===\nWhen he began his career in the 1920s, the principal focus in quality management was on the quality of the end, or finished, product. The tools used were from the Bell system of [[Sampling (statistics)|acceptance sampling]], inspection plans, and control charts. The ideas of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] dominated.\n\nJuran is widely credited for adding the human dimension to quality management. He pushed for the education and training of managers. For Juran, human relations problems were the ones to isolate and [[resistance to change]] was the root cause of quality issues.  Juran credits [[Margaret Mead]]'s book ''Cultural Patterns and Technical Change'' for illuminating the core problem in reforming business quality.<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|267}} He wrote ''Managerial Breakthrough'', which was published in 1964, outlining the issue.\n\nJuran's concept of quality management extended outside the walls of the factory to encompass nonmanufacturing processes, especially those that might be thought of as service related.  For example, in an interview published in 1997<ref name=\"Selden 1997\">{{Citation|title='''Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop''' |author = Paul H. Selden|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|pages =xxi–xxii}}</ref> he observed:\n{{Quote |The key issues facing managers in sales are no different than those faced by managers in other disciplines.  Sales managers say they face problems such as \"It takes us too long...we need to reduce the error rate.\"  They want to know, \"How do customers perceive us?\"  These issues are no different than those facing managers trying to improve in other fields.  The systematic approaches to improvement are identical. ... There should be no reason our familiar principles of quality and process engineering would not work in the sales process.}}\n\n===The Juran trilogy===\nJuran was one of the first to write about the [[cost of poor quality]].<ref>Bergman & Klefsjö (2007), ''Kvalitet från behov till användning'', Studentlitteratur, ISBN 978-91-44-04416-3</ref> This was illustrated by his \"Juran trilogy\", an approach to [[cross-functional team|cross-functional management]], which is composed of three managerial processes: quality planning, quality control, and quality improvement. Without change, there will be a constant waste, during change there will be increased costs, but after the improvement, margins will be higher and the increased costs get recouped.\n\n===Transferring quality knowledge between East and West===\nDuring his 1966 visit to Japan, Juran learned about the Japanese concept of [[quality circles]], which he enthusiastically evangelized in the West.<ref>{{Citation | publication-date = January 1967 | title = The QC Circle Phenomenon | periodical = Industrial Quality Control | publication-place = [[Buffalo, New York]] | publisher = Society of Quality Control Engineers}}</ref>\nJuran also acted as a matchmaker between U.S. and Japanese companies looking for introductions to each other.<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|260}}\n\n==Juran Institute==\n<!-- Juran Institute redirects here. Any changes to section title should also change the redirect -->\nJuran founded the Juran Institute  in 1979. The Institute is an international training, certification, and consulting company which provides training and consulting services in quality management, [[Lean manufacturing]] management and [[business process management]], as well as [[Six Sigma]] certification.  The institute is based in [[Southbury, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juran.com/|title=Management Consulting - Juran Global|work=juran.com|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nJuran was active well into his 80s, and only gave up international travel at age 86. He retired at the age of 90 but still gave interviews. His activities during the second half of his life include:\n*Consulting for U.S. companies such as [[Armour and Company]], [[Avery Dennison|Dennison Manufacturing Company]], [[Merck & Co.|Merck, Sharp & Dohme]], [[Otis Elevator Company]], [[Xerox]], and the [[United States Navy]] Fleet Ballistic Missile System.<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|276–286}}\n*Consulting for Western European and Japanese companies, such as [[Rolls-Royce Motors]], [[Philips]], [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Toyota Motor Company]]<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|307–324}}\n*''Pro bono'' consulting for Soviet-bloc countries (Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Russia, Poland, and Yugoslavia)<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|313–316}}\n*Founding the Juran Institute<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|325–336}} and  the Juran Foundation.<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|337–342}}\n\n==Later life and death==\nHe started to write his memoirs at 92, which were published two months before he celebrated his 99th birthday. He gave two interviews at 94 and 97.\n\nIn 2004, he turned 100 years old and was awarded an honorary doctorate from [[Luleå University of Technology]] in [[Sweden]]. A special event was held in May to mark his 100th birthday.\n\nHe and Sadie celebrated their 81st wedding anniversary in June 2007. They were both at the age of 102 at the time of the event. Juran died of a [[stroke]] on 28 February 2008, at the age of 103 in [[Rye (city), New York|Rye, New York]]. He was active on his 103rd birthday and was caring for himself and Sadie who was in poor health when he died. Sadie died on 2 December 2008, at the age of 103 years. They were survived by their four children, nine grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren.<ref>{{Citation\n | title= Joseph Juran, pioneer of quality control, dies at age 103\n | newspaper= [[International Herald Tribune]]\n | date= March 1, 2008\n | url= http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/01/business/NA-FIN-US-Obit-Juran.php\n | accessdate = April 5, 2008\n }}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n | title= Joseph Juran, 103, Pioneer in Quality Control, Dies\n | newspaper= [[New York Times]]\n | date= 2008-03-03\n | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/business/03juran.html\n | accessdate = 2008-06-01\n| first=Nick\n| last=Bunkley}}</ref> Juran left a book that was 37% complete, which he began at age 98.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Quality by Design]]\n\n==Bibliography==\nJuran cites the following as his most influential works:<ref name=autobio/>{{rp|261–275}}\n\n===Books===\n\n:*{{Citation | publication-date = 1951 | title = Quality Control Handbook | publication-place = [[New York, New York]] | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | oclc = 1220529}}\n::Eventually published in six editions:  [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64292499 2nd edition, 1962], [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/213513128 3rd edition, 1974], [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17546189 4th edition, 1988], [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/228361688 5th edition, 1999], [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/700458804 6th edition, 2010]\n:*{{Citation | publication-date = 1964 | title = Managerial Breakthrough | publication-place = [[New York, New York]] | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]]}}\n:*{{Citation | publication-date = 1967 | title = Management of Quality Control | publication-place = [[New York, New York]] | publisher = Joseph M.
