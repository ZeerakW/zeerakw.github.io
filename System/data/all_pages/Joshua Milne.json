He resigned his position in the Sun Life Office on 19 December 1843, and died at [[Upper Clapton]] on 4 January 1851.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Actuarial works==\nWhen Milne entered the field, life tables were based on the data taken by [[Richard Price]] from the burial registers (1735–80) of [[All Saints' Church, Northampton]]. Milne took as the basis of his calculations the [[bills of mortality]] from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], which had been prepared by [[John Heysham]]. After a long correspondence (12 September 1812 – 14 June 1814) with Heysham, he published his major work ''A Treatise on the Valuation of Annuities and Assurances'' (1815).<ref>''A Treatise on the Valuation of Annuities and Assurances on Lives and Survivorships; on the Construction of Tables of Mortality; and on the Probabilities and Expectations of Life'', London, 1815, 2 vols.</ref> Milne's new \"Carlisle table\" marked an epoch in [[actuarial science]]. Considering the narrow base of data from which he had to work, it was quite accurate, and was widely adopted by insurance societies. The [[Carlisle Table]] was largely superseded by that published by the [[Institute of Actuaries]] in 1870.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> But it was still considered useful in the early 20th century.<ref>Edward Rochie Hardy and Walter Lindner, ''Insurance and Real Estate.

He was the first to compute accurately, at the cost of heavy algebra, the value of fines (i.e. payments to be made at the successive deaths of persons).<ref>[[Augustus De Morgan]], ''An Essay on Probabilities, and on their application to life contingencies and insurance companies'' (1838?), p. 230; [https://archive.org/stream/essayonprobabili00demouoft#page/230/mode/2up archive.org]</ref> His notation for the expression of life contingencies suggested that of [[Augustus De Morgan]] in his ''Essay on Probabilities''.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nMilne also contributed to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica, fourth edition]]'', articles on \"Annuities\", \"Bills of Mortality\", and \"Law of Mortality\".<ref name=\"DNB\"/><ref>The last was reprinted in 1827 (''Report from the Select Committee on the Laws respecting Friendly Societies'', 1827, App. G 3), together with a statement on the Carlisle and Northampton tables of mortality (App. B).</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n{{DNB|wstitle=Milne, Joshua|volume=38}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Milne, Joshua\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = British actuary\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1776\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 1851\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Milne, Joshua}}\n[[Category:1776 births]]\n[[Category:1851 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century English mathematicians]]\n[[Category:British actuaries]]\n\n\n{{England-bio-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Joshua Milne"}}}}
