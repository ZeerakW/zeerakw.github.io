He was a director of the [[Bank of England]] and chairman of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]].\n\n==Life and career==\nStamp was born in [[Hampstead]], [[London]],<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=josiah&lastname=stamp&eventyear=1880&eventyear_offset=0|title = Results from England & Wales Births 1837-2006|date = |accessdate = 30 August 2014|website = findmypast.co.uk|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> the third of seven children; his youngest brother [[Laurence Dudley Stamp|L.

At the time of his birth his father owned and managed a provision and general shop in London.\n\nEducated at a private [[Baptist]] school, Bethany House at [[Goudhurst]], Kent,<ref name=odnb>{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 52|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=85|isbn=0-19-861402-0}}Article by Beveridge, revised by Jose Harris.</ref> Josiah left school at 16 and joined the Civil Service as a boy clerk in the [[Inland Revenue]] Department.  With a brief interval in the [[Board of Trade]], he rose to assistant inspector of taxes at [[Hereford]] in 1903, an inspector of taxes in London in 1909, and assistant secretary in 1916.<ref name=odnb />\n\nMeanwhile, he was studying economics as an external student. He was awarded a first class degree (1911) by the [[University of London]] and a doctorate (1916) by the [[London School of Economics]]. The thesis, published as ''British Incomes and Property'', became a standard work on the subject and established his academic reputation.\n\nStamp met his future wife, Olive Jessie Marsh, a soprano and student teacher, when he was seventeen. Pursuing their work and studies separately for several years until their marriage in 1903, they engaged in a correspondence that gives us a rich sense of Stamp's formative years (Jones 1964). Between 1904 and 1917 they had four sons, [[Wilfred Carlyle Stamp, 2nd Baron Stamp|Wilfred]], Trevor, Maxwell and Colin. It was as a result of this marriage that Stamp, son of a Baptist father and [[Church of England]] mother, converted to the [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodist Church]].<ref name=odnb3>{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 52|pages=85–86}}</ref> A few of his writings (see below), such as ''Christianity and Economics'' (1939), discuss the relevance of Christian values to contemporary economics systems.\n\nIn 1919 Stamp changed career, leaving the civil service for business, to join as secretary and director of [[Nobel Industries (Scotland)|Nobel Industries Ltd]], from which [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] developed. In 1926 he became Chairman of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] and was instrumental in getting [[William Stanier]] appointed in 1932 as Chief Mechanical Engineer to resolve the locomotive problems of the Company. In 1928 he was appointed a director of the Bank of England.\n\nStamp was often called to serve on public commissions, committees and boards: he was a member of the Royal Commission on Income Tax, 1919, the Northern Ireland Finance Arbitration Committee, 1923–24, the Committee on Taxation and [[National Debt]], 1924, the Dawes Reparation Commission's Committee on German Currency and Finance, 1924, the Young Committee in 1929 and the [[Economic Advisory Council]], 1930–39.\n\nFrom 1927 until his death he was Colonel commanding the [[Royal Engineers]] [[Engineer and Logistic Staff Corps|Railway and Transport Corps]],<ref name=kellys>{{cite book|title=Kelly's Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes, 1940|publisher=Kelly's|page=1725}}</ref> and became Honorary Colonel of Transportation Units in the Royal Engineers [[Supplementary Reserve]]<ref name=www>{{cite book|title=Who Was Who, 1941–1950|year=1952|publisher=A and C Black|page=1091}}</ref> in 1938.<ref name=burkes>{{cite book|title=Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 1939|publisher=Burke's Peerage Ltd|page=2299}}</ref>\n\nStamp was widely regarded as the leading British expert on taxation, and took an active part in the work of the [[Royal Statistical Society]], serving as president from 1930 to 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rss.org.uk/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=486|title = Royal Statistical Society Presidents|publisher= Royal Statistical Society|accessdate = 6 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nStamp was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Commander in the Order of the British Empire (CBE)]] in 1918, [[Order of the British Empire|Knight in the Order (KBE)]] in 1920, and [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Grand Cross (GBE)]] in 1924 and [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross of the Bath (GCB)]] in 1936.  He was a Knight of Grace of the [[Order of St John of Jerusalem]].  He also held the Grand Cross of the [[Austrian Order of Merit]] (awarded 1936) and the Afghan Order of Astaur.<ref name=kellys /> He was raised to the peerage on 28 June 1938 as '''[[Baron Stamp]]''' of [[Shortlands]], in the [[County of Kent]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34528 |date=5 July 1938 |startpage=4327}}</ref>\n\nHe was first Mayor of the Borough of [[Beckenham]], Kent, within which he had settled at [[Shortlands]], in 1935. He was made an honorary Freeman of the same borough in 1936 and of [[Blackpool]] in 1937.<ref name=www />\n\nStamp refused to be moved out of his house, 'Tantallon', in Park Hill Road, [[Shortlands]], because of German bombing during [[The Blitz]].  He, aged sixty, and his wife, aged sixty-three,<ref name=cwgc2>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/3114173/STAMP,%20OLIVE%20JESSIE%20THE%20RT%20HON] CWGC Casualty Record, under Beckenham Municipal Borough.</ref> were killed by a bomb's direct hit on the air-raid shelter at their home on 16 April 1941.  They were buried at [[Beckenham Crematorium and Cemetery|Beckenham Cemetery]].<ref name=cwgc>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2824710/STAMP,%20JOSIAH%20CHARLES] CWGC Casualty Record, in his capacity as Colonel, General Staff. His wife and first son are separately recorded as civilian casualties under Beckenham Municipal Borough.</ref> Ironically in 1935, he had been a founder member of the [[Anglo-German Fellowship]]<ref>''INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP: Anglo-Russian and Anglo-German Societies'' [[The Manchester Guardian]] 29 November 1935</ref> and had made low key visits to [[Nuremberg]] in 1936 (when he met [[Adolf Hitler]] – whom Stamp noted was a \"statesman and demagogue combined\" – and [[Franz von Papen]]), and 1937, to view the [[Nazi Party]] Congress with the unspoken support of the then [[Foreign Secretary (United Kingdom)|Foreign Secretary]] [[Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]].<ref name=odnb2>{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 52|page=87}}</ref>\n\nStamp's son [[Wilfred Carlyle Stamp, 2nd Baron Stamp|Wilfred]] was killed at the same time and in the same place, but [[English law]] has [[legal fiction]] that in the event of the order of deaths being indeterminable, the elder is deemed to have died first. Legally therefore, Wilfred momentarily inherited the peerage: and as a consequence the family had to pay [[death duty]] twice. The peerage passed to the second of Stamp's four sons, [[Trevor Charles Stamp, 3rd Baron Stamp|Trevor]].\n\n==Quotes==\n\nA well known quote from Stamp (often referred to as Stamp's Law) is:\n\n:\"The government are very keen on amassing statistics. They collect them, add them, raise them to the nth power, take the cube root and prepare wonderful diagrams. But you must never forget that every one of these figures comes in the first instance from the ''chowky dar'' (village watchman in India), who just puts down what he damn pleases.\" (Stamp recounting a story from [[Harold Cox]] who quotes an anonymous English judge).<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Stamp\n | first = Josiah\n | title = Some Economic Factors in Modern Life\n | year = 1929\n | publisher = P. S. King & Son\n | pages = 258–259\n}}</ref>\n\nAnother quote often attributed to Stamp is:\n\n:\"Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again. However, take away from them the power to create money and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear, for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But, if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money.\" (Said to be from an informal talk at the University of Texas in the 1920s, but as yet unverified.)<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The legalized crime of banking and a constitutional remedy\n|author=Silas Walter Adams\n|publisher=Meador |year=1958 |location=Boston |oclc=3906807\n|pages=13,30,58,90,246}}\nAlso available as\n[http://www.yamaguchy.com/library/silas/silas_index.html web transcription].</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n\n* Beveridge, 'Stamp, Josiah Charles, first Baron Stamp (1880–1941)', rev.
