He studied in Paris in the 1930s, at the École Supérieure d'Electricité, Institut de Statistique, and, finally, at the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]]. His work was carried out in wartime England in the 1940s, while employed at the [[de Havilland]] Aircraft company. He was a professor of mathematics at [[Macquarie University]], a colleague of [[John Clive Ward]] at the former School of Mathematics and Physics, having previously worked at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"Bio\" />\n\n==Works==\n*{{Cite journal | last1 = Moyal | first1 = J.
