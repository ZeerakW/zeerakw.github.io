He also made fundamental contributions to statistical methods for geophysics. Bartels was the first President of the [[International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy]]. With [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]], he wrote the influential book ''[[List of important publications in geology#Geomagnetism|Geomagnetism]]''.\n\n==Life and career==\nBartels was awarded his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Georg August University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] in 1923, then worked at the [[Potsdam]] magnetic observatory as a post-doctorate. In 1928 he was named [[professor]] at [[Eberswalde]], teaching [[meteorology]]. He became full professor at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] in 1936, and director of the Potsdam Geophysical Institute. From 1931 until the second year of [[World War II]] he was also a research associate at the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. He collaborated with [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]] to publish the two-volume work ''Geomagnetism'', a definitive reference on geophysics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.egu.eu/awards-medals/awards-and-medals/award/portrait-julius-bartels.html |title=Awards & Medals: Julius Bartels |author=[[European Geosciences Union]] |accessdate=September 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the war in 1946 he became professor in Göttingen. He was also a director at the [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Institute]] for Physics of the [[Stratosphere]] (today [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]]) between 1955 and 1964. When 1958 [[ICSU]] created the [[Committee on Space Research]] (''COSPAR''). Bartels became chairman of the (West-)German branch. From 1954 until 1957 he served as first President of the [[International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy|IAGA]]. Between 1960 and 1963 he was vice-president of the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics|IUGG]].<ref>A memorial note was published in Meteorlogische Rundschau 1964 by Wilfried Schröder.</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\nAmong his contributions was the development of the [[K-index|Kp-index]], and he suggested the existence of \"M-regions\" on the [[Sun]] that resulted in geomagnetic activity. These [[coronal holes]] were later confirmed by the [[Skylab]] mission. Finally he also helped initiate the [[International Geophysical Year]], which took place in 1957/8.\n\nThe [[Bartels' Rotation Number]] of the Sun based on a regular 27 day cycle is named after him.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bartels |first1=J. |year=1934 |title=Twenty-Seven Day Recurrences in Terrestrial-Magnetic and Solar Activity, 1923 1933 |journal=[[Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity]] |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=201–202a |doi=10.1029/TE039i003p00201 |bibcode = 1934TeMAE..39..201B }}</ref> It is similar to the [[Carrington rotation]] which is based on 27.2753 days.\n\n==Awards and honors==\n* Posthumously awarded the [[William Bowie Medal]] of the [[American Geophysical Union]].\n* The ''Julius Bartels Medal'', of the [[European Geosciences Union]] Division on Solar-Terrestrial Sciences, was named in his honor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.egu.eu/awards-medals/awards-and-medals/award/julius-bartels.html |title=Awards & Honors: Julius Bartels Medal |author=[[European Geosciences Union]] |accessdate=September 2011}}</ref>\n* The crater [[Bartels (crater)|Bartels]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.\n*[[The Chree Medal and Prize]] in 1953\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of geophysicists]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |first1=Wilfried |last1= Schröder |title=Sydney Chapman and his connections with some German geophysicists |journal= Acta Geodaetica et Geophysica Hungarica  |year=2010 |volume=44 |number=2 |pages=245&ndash;254  |doi=10.1556/AGeod.44.2009.2.10}}\n*{{cite book |first1=Sydney |last1=Chapman |author1-link=Sydney Chapman (mathematician) |first2=Julius |last2=Bartels |title= Geomagnetism Volume 1: Geomagnetic and Related Phenomena |year=1940 |asin=B002K07MAO |oclc=499431969 |volume=6 |series = The International Series of Monographs on Physics |url=http://www.archive.org/details/GeomagnetismVol1}}\n*{{cite book |first1=Sydney |last1=Chapman |author1-link=Sydney Chapman (mathematician) |first2=Julius |last2=Bartels |title= Geomagnetism Volume 2: Analysis of the Data and Physical Theories |year=1940 |asin=B0020TCMR8 |oclc=458641769 |volume=6 |series = The International Series of Monographs on Physics |url=http://www.archive.org/details/GeomagnetismVol2}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Bartels, Julius\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = German geophysicist and statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = August 17, 1899\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = March 6, 1964\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bartels, Julius}}\n[[Category:1899 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Magdeburg]]\n[[Category:People from the Province of Saxony]]\n[[Category:German geophysicists]]\n[[Category:University of Göttingen alumni]]\n[[Category:German statisticians]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Julius Bartels"}}}}
