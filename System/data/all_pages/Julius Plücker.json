He made fundamental contributions to the field of [[analytical geometry]] and was a pioneer in the investigations of [[cathode ray]]s that led eventually to the discovery of the [[electron]]. He also vastly extended the study of [[Gabriel Lamé|Lamé]] curves.\n\n== Biography ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\n\n=== Early years ===\nPlücker was born at [[Elberfeld]] (now part of [[Wuppertal]]). After being educated at [[Düsseldorf]] and at the universities of [[Bonn]], [[Heidelberg]] and Berlin he went to Paris in 1823, where he came under the influence of the great school of French geometers, whose founder, [[Gaspard Monge]], had only recently died.\n\nIn 1825 he returned to Bonn, and in 1828 was made professor of mathematics.\n\nIn the same year he published the first volume of his ''Analytisch-geometrische Entwicklungen'', which introduced the method of [[abridged notation]].\n\nIn 1831 he published the second volume, in which he clearly established on a firm and independent basis [[projective duality]].\n\n=== Career ===\nIn 1836, Plücker was made professor of physics at [[University of Bonn]]. In 1858, after a year of working with vacuum tubes of his Bonn colleague [[Heinrich Geissler]],<ref>John Theodore Merz, ''A history of European thought in the nineteenth century'' (2). W. Blackwood and sons, 1912, pp. 189–190.</ref> he published his first classical researches on the action of the magnet on the electric discharge in rarefied gases. He found that the discharge caused a fluorescent glow to form on the glass walls of the vacuum tube, and that the glow could be made to shift by applying an electromagnet to the tube, thus creating a magnetic field. It was later shown that the glow was produced by cathode rays.\n\nPlücker, first by himself and afterwards in conjunction with [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf|Johann Hittorf]], made many important discoveries in the spectroscopy of gases. He was the first to use the vacuum tube with the capillary part now called a [[Geissler tube]], by means of which the luminous intensity of feeble electric discharges was raised sufficiently to allow of spectroscopic investigation. He anticipated [[Robert Wilhelm Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in announcing that the lines of the spectrum were characteristic of the chemical substance which emitted them, and in indicating the value of this discovery in chemical analysis. According to Hittorf, he was the first who saw the three lines of the hydrogen spectrum, which a few months after his death, were recognized in the spectrum of the solar protuberances.\n\nIn 1865, Plücker returned to the field of geometry and invented what was known as ''[[line geometry]]'' in the nineteenth century. In [[projective geometry]], [[Plücker coordinates]] refer to a set of [[homogeneous co-ordinates]] introduced initially to embed the set of lines in three dimensions as a [[quadric]] in five dimensions. The construction uses 2×2 [[minor determinant]]s, or equivalently the second [[exterior power]] of the underlying vector space of dimension 4. It is now part of the theory of [[Grassmannian]]s, to which these co-ordinates apply in generality (''k''-dimensional subspaces of ''n''-dimensional space).\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Analytisch-geometrische Entwicklungen (The Development of Analytic Geometry), 2 vol in 1828–31<ref name=britannica>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/464998/Julius-Plucker|title=Julius Plücker|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>\n*Theorie der algebraischen Curven (Theory of Algebraic Curves) in 1839<ref name=britannica/>\n*System der analytischen Geometrie (System of Analytic Geometry) in 1835<ref name=britannica/>\n*System der Geometrie des Raumes in neuer analytischer Behandlungsweise (System of the Geometry of Space in a New Analytical Treatment) in 1846<ref name=britannica/>\n* Neue Geometrie des Raumes gegründet auf die Betrachtung der geraden Linie als Raumelement (New Geometry of Space Founded on the Treatment of the Straight Line as Space Element) in 1868–69.<ref name=britannica/>\n\n==Awards==\nPlücker was the recipient of the [[Copley Medal]] from the [[Royal Society]] in 1866.<ref>http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Plucker.html</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Plücker's conoid]]\n*[[Plücker coordinates]]\n*[[Plücker embedding]]\n*[[Plücker formula]]\n*[[Plücker surface]]\n*[[Plücker matrix]]\n*[[Timeline of low-temperature technology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Born, Heinrich, ''Die Stadt Elberfeld.
