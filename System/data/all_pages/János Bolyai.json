The discovery of a consistent alternative geometry that might correspond to the structure of the universe helped to free mathematicians to study abstract concepts irrespective of any possible connection with the physical world.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/72441/Janos-Bolyai Encyclopedia Britannica: János Bolyai]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBolyai was born in the [[Transylvania]]n town of [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsvár (Klausenburg)]], then part of Hungary in the [[Habsburg Empire]] (now [[Cluj-Napoca]] in [[Romania]]), the son of Zsuzsanna Benkő and the well-known mathematician [[Farkas Bolyai]].\n\n[[File:Bolyai Janos szulohaza.jpg|right|thumb|The House where the mathematician János Bolyai was born]]\nBy the age of 13, he had mastered [[calculus]] and other forms of [[analytical mechanics]], receiving instruction from his father. He studied at the [[Royal Engineering College]] in [[Vienna]] from 1818 to 1822.\n\n==Career==\nHe became so obsessed with [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]] that his father wrote to him: \"For God's sake, I beseech you, give it up. Fear it no less than sensual passions because it too may take all your time and deprive you of your health, peace of mind and happiness in life\". János, however, persisted in his quest and eventually came to the conclusion that the postulate is independent of the other axioms of geometry and that different consistent geometries can be constructed on its negation.\n\nHe wrote to his father: \"I created a new, different world out of nothing.\"<ref name=amsNotices />\n\nBetween 1820 and 1823 he prepared a treatise on a complete system of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. Bolyai's work was published in 1832 as an appendix to a mathematics textbook by his father.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], on reading the Appendix, wrote to a friend saying \"I regard this young [[geometer]] Bolyai as a genius of the first order\". In 1848 Bolyai discovered that [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]] had published a similar piece of work in 1829. Though Lobachevsky published his work a few years earlier than Bolyai, it contained only [[hyperbolic geometry]]. Bolyai and Lobachevsky did not know each other or each other's works.\n\nIn addition to his work in geometry, Bolyai developed a rigorous geometric concept of [[complex numbers]] as ordered pairs of [[real numbers]]. Although he never published more than the 24 pages of the Appendix, he left more than 20,000 pages of mathematical manuscripts when he died. These can now be found in the [[Bolyai–Teleki library]] in Marosvásárhely (today [[Târgu Mureş]]), where Bolyai died.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe was an accomplished [[Hyperpolyglot|polyglot]] speaking nine foreign [[language]]s, including Chinese and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]. He learned the violin and performed in Vienna. {{Cquote|It is related of him that he was challenged by thirteen officers of his garrison, a thing not unlikely to happen considering how differently he thought from everyone else. He fought them all in succession – making it his only condition that he should be allowed to play on his violin for an interval between meeting each opponent. He disarmed or wounded all his antagonists. It can be easily imagined that a temperament such as his was not one congenial to his military superiors. He was retired in 1833.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hinton|first1=Charles Howard|authorlink1=Charles Howard Hinton|title=The Fourth Dimension|date=1912|orig-year=1904|publisher=G.
