He is considered a key figure in the development of quality initiatives in Japan, particularly the [[quality circle]].<ref>[http://asq.org/about-asq/who-we-are/bio_ishikawa.html ASQ: About Kaoru Ishikawa\"]. Accessed 17 November 2014</ref>  He is best known outside Japan for the [[Ishikawa diagram|Ishikawa]] or cause and effect diagram (also known as [[Ishikawa diagram|fishbone diagram]]) often used in the analysis of [[industrial process]]es.\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Tokyo, the oldest of the eight sons of Ichiro Ishikawa. In 1939 he graduated [[University of Tokyo]] with an engineering degree in applied chemistry. After graduating from the University of Tokyo he worked as a naval technical officer from 1939-1941.  Between 1941-1947  Ishikawa worked at the [[Nissan]] Liquid Fuel Company. In 1947 Ishikawa started his academic career as an associate professor at the University of Tokyo. He undertook the presidency of the [[Musashi Institute of Technology]] in 1978.\n\nIn 1949, Ishikawa joined the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) quality control research group. After [[World War II]] Japan looked to transform its industrial sector, which in North America was then still perceived as a producer of cheap wind-up toys and poor quality cameras. It was his skill at mobilizing large groups of people towards a specific common goal that was largely responsible for Japan's quality-improvement initiatives. He translated, integrated and expanded the management concepts of [[W. Edwards Deming]] and [[Joseph M. Juran]] into the Japanese system.\n\nAfter becoming a full professor in the Faculty of Engineering at The University of Tokyo (1960) Ishikawa introduced the concept of [[quality circle]]s (1962) in conjunction with JUSE. This concept began as an experiment to see what effect the \"leading hand\" (Gemba-cho) could have on quality. It was a natural extension of these forms of training to all levels of an organization (the top and middle managers having already been trained). Although many companies were invited to participate, only one company at the time, [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|Nippon Telephone & Telegraph]], accepted. Quality circles would soon become very popular and form an important link in a company's [[Total Quality Management]] system. Ishikawa would write two books on quality circles (''QC Circle Koryo'' and ''How to Operate QC Circle Activities'').\n\nAmong his efforts to promote quality were the Annual Quality Control Conference for Top Management (1963) and several books on quality control (the ''Guide to Quality Control'' was translated into English). He was the chairman of the editorial board of the monthly ''Statistical Quality Control.'' Ishikawa was involved in international standardization activities.\n\n1982 saw the development of the [[Ishikawa diagram]] which is used to determine root causes.\n\nAt Ishikawa's 1989 death, Juran delivered this [[eulogy]]:<ref>Westcott, Russell T. \"Leave A Legacy\". ''Quality Progress''. December 2009. p. 63.</ref>\n\n{{cquote|There is so much to be learned by studying how Dr. Ishikawa managed to accomplish so much during a single lifetime. In my observation, he did so by applying his natural gifts in an exemplary way. He was dedicated to serving society rather than serving himself. His manner was modest, and this elicited the cooperation of others. He followed his own teachings by securing facts and subjecting them to rigorous analysis. He was completely sincere, and as a result was trusted completely.|}}\n\n==Contributions to quality of improvement==\n* User Friendly Quality Control\n* Fishbone Cause and Effect Diagram -  [[Ishikawa diagram]]\n* Implementation of [[Quality Circles]]\n* Emphasised the [[Internal customer]]\n* Shared Vision\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n* 1972 [[American Society for Quality]]'s Eugene L.
