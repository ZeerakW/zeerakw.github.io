Since its inception in 2008, she was also the Chief Executive of the [[UK Statistics Authority]].<ref name=\"One\"/><ref name=\"Two\"/> She now has a range of non-executive roles including membership of Pricewaterhouse Coopers Public Interest Body, Trustee of National Heart Forum, member of the Court of Governors, University of Westminster.\n\n==Background==\nBorn Karen Williamson in [[Los Angeles]], USA, she moved to Britain when she was a young child and was educated at [[Maidstone Grammar School for Girls]] and [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]], [[London]]. Her father was a US serviceman during [[World War II]] and her mother, who was English, was a teacher. Karen Dunnell has been married twice: to Keith Dunnell (1969–76) and Professor Michael Adler (1979–94). She has two adult daughters by her second marriage and two grandchildren. She lives in [[London]] and has a home in the [[Var (département)|Var]] in SE [[France]].\n\n==Career==\nKaren Dunnell studied sciences at school because she wanted to go into medicine. However, a growing interest in politics and society led her to study sociology at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]], [[London]], from where she graduated in 1967.<ref name=joyce>{{cite journal | last =Joyce | first =Helen | title =Inside National Statistics | journal =Significance | volume =2 | issue =4 |pages =pp. 174–176 |date=December 2005 | url =http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/doSearch?action=runSearch&type=advanced&result=true&prevSearch=%2Bauthorsfield%3A(Dunnell%2CKaren) | accessdate =2007-09-22 | doi =10.1111/j.1740-9713.2005.00132.x  }}</ref> She began her career as a health care researcher with the [[Institute of Community Studies]], where much of her work involved healthcare surveys, and, in 1972, she wrote a book, ''Medicine Takers, Prescribers and Hoarders'' with [[Ann Cartwright]],.<ref>{{cite book | last =Dunnell | first =K. |author2=A.

One of these was the UK's contribution to the World Fertility Survey, published as a book, ''Family Formation'', in 1976. This measured cohabitation for the first time and first asked the question, now a standard, ''\"At what age did you first have sexual intercourse?\"''. The other studied the work of community nurses, using an intensive survey combined with diary-keeping.<ref name=joyce /> She was promoted to Assistant Director, overseeing all health surveys in the OPCS. These included surveys on drinking and smoking and a major survey on disability that established what proportion of people in different age groups had different disabilities. She was responsible, in this post, for liaising with the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]].<ref name=joyce />\n\nIn 1990, she moved from working with health surveys in the OPCS to medical statistics.<ref name=joyce /> When OPCS merged with the [[Central Statistical Office, UK|Central Statistical Office]] to form the ONS in 1996, she became Director of Demography and Health Statistics, working on general practice statistics and inequalities in health, and established the ''Health Statistics Quarterly'' journal.<ref name=joyce /> In 1999, she moved to a central post responsible for launching ''National Statistics'' and dealing with the arrival of [[Len Cook]], the first National Statistician, in 2000.<ref name=joyce /> She was promoted to Group Director in Social Statistics in 2000, managing health, demography, population, labour market and social reporting and was temporarily promoted to the Board of the ONS in 2001 in the run-up to the 2001 census.<ref name=joyce /> A major reorganisation, which divided the activities of ONS into 'sources' and 'analysis', followed and Dunnell was given the job of setting up the new \"Sources\" Directorate, bringing together household and business surveys, the infrastructure that supported them, the statistical modernisation programme and planning for the 2011 [[Census]].<ref name=joyce /> She took up this post on the ONS Executive in 2002.<ref name=joyce />\n\n===National Statistician===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:104 0475.JPG|thumb|Karen Dunnell in New York City for UN Statistics Commission 2004|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 14 December 2008|date=May 2012}}]] -->\nKaren Dunnell was appointed National Statistician and Director of the Office for National Statistics from 1 September 2005 at a time when the government was being criticised for the quality, credibility and uses to which it put the statistics generated both by ONS and by governments departments.<ref name=\"One\">[http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page8038.asp ''\"National Statistician - Director office for National Statistics\"''], 10 Downing Street press release, 4 August 2005, retrieved 5 June 2007.</ref><ref name=\"Two\">[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article551779.ece ''\"Veteran insider to run the ONS balancing act\"''], Times Online, 5 August 2005, retrieved 5 June 2007.</ref> Soon afterwards, [[Gordon Brown]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], announced that, following the success of the idea of independence for the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England as a means of gaining trust in the its interest-rate decisions, a form of independence should be applied to ONS so that its data could also gain public trust. ONS is now accountable to Parliament via a Statistics Board, known as the [[UK Statistics Authority]] (UKSA), rather than, as previously, via a Treasury minister. Following the implementation of the [[Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007]], the role of [[Registrar-General]]  for England and Wales, an ancient additional title, held by the National Statistician since the inception of ONS, was transferred, with the [[General Register Office for England and Wales]], which she also headed, to the Identification and Passport Service in the [[Home Office]]\n\n===Controversy===\nA government policy inherited by Karen Dunnell as National Statistician aroused controversy. Following the efficiency reviews initiated by the Chancellor and Prime Minister (viz. ''Review of Public Sector Relocation'' by Sir [[Michael Lyons (UK politician)|Michael Lyons]], 2003-4, and ''Releasing Resources to the Front Line'', Sir Peter Gershon, 2004), the government adopted a policy, criticised by unions, of dispersal of certain public service posts and functions out of London.<ref>[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk./consultations_and_legislation/lyons/consult_lyons_index.cfm Independent Review of public sector relocation], H.

M. Treasury, 12 July 2004</ref> The policy was initially applied to ONS during [[Len Cook]]'s tenure as National Statistician but after Karen Dunnell succeeded to the post, ONS accelerated the policy of relocating the Office for National Statistics away from London and concentrating staff in its offices in Titchfield, near Southampton, and in Newport, South Wales, to which the ONS headquarters has moved. The announcement, in January 2007, of the almost complete closure of the ONS's London offices by 2010 reversed a decision to retain a sizeable office in the capital.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/4093ec26-0ed2-11dc-b444-000b5df10621.html ''\"Fears for quality as statisticians scatter\"''], Financial Times, 30 May 2007, retrieved 5 June 2007.</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6267087.stm ''\"ONS set to close down London HQ\"''], BBC news report, 16 January 2007, retrieved 9 June 2007.</ref> This relocation policy, together with substantial expenditure cutbacks in recent government spending settlements, resulted in disquiet among London-based staff whose representatives reported morale problems and a high staff turnover rate among staff still in London.<ref>[https://www.fda.org.uk/dman/Document.phx/Home+page+items/FDA+evidence+to+the+Treasury+sub-committee+inquiry+into+the+efficiency+of+the+Chancellor's+departments+(Office+for+National+Statistics)?folderId=Home%2Bpage%2Bitems&cmd=download Evidence for Treasury Sub Committee Inquiry into the efficiency of the Chancellor’s Departments], written submission by the [[FDA (trade union)]], para. 2.2, 9 May 2007, retrieved 5 June 2007.</ref> To set against the risks to data quality of any loss of expertise, especially among London-based staff who were unwilling to move, including analysts in National Accounts and in health statistics, Ms. Dunnell defended ONS implementation of government policy on civil service relocation. In the face of some Bank of England disquiet, reported in 2007 to the Treasury Select Committee, about risks to economic data quality, combined with opposition from London staff (including a lack of confidence in management expressed in a staff survey highlighted by staff unions), she asserted that the ONS Board had agreed a process of managed and gradual change to take account of these risks, building up expertise in Newport before shifting functions there. She also cited the benefits to the local economy, the skills of existing ONS staff in Newport and access to universities and other resources in the region as well as the benefits of operating key functions from a single location.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d664845a-1237-11dc-b963-000b5df10621.html ''\"Statistics officers get the measure of relocation\"''], article by Karen Dunnell, Financial Times, 4 June 2007, retrieved 6 June 2007.</ref>\n\n===Other roles===\nOutside the OPCS, Karen Dunnell has been a member of the British Sociology Association and was on the committee of its BSA Medical Sociology Group.
