He then travelled to Germany to study physics at the [[University of Heidelberg]] under [[G H Quincke]] and metaphysics under [[Kuno Fischer]]. He next visited the [[University of Berlin]], where he attended the lectures of the famous physiologist [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] on [[Darwinism]] (Emil was a brother of [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], the mathematician). Other subjects which he studied in Berlin included Roman Law, taught by [[Bruns]] and [[Mommsen]], medieval and 16th century German Literature, and Socialism. He was strongly influenced by the courses he attended at this time and he became sufficiently expert on German literature that he was offered a [[Germanics]] post at [[Kings College, Cambridge]]. But compared to Cambridge students, physically developed by athletics, Karl found German students weak. He wrote his mother, \"I used to think athletics and sport was overestimated at Cambridge, but now I think it cannot be too highly valued.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Warwick, Andrew |title=Masters of theory: Cambridge and the rise of mathematical physics |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=2003 |chapter=4: Exercising the student body: Mathematics, manliness and athleticism |pages=176–226 |isbn=0-226-87375-7 |oclc= }}</ref>\n\nOn returning to England in 1880, Pearson first went to Cambridge:\n\n{{quote|Back in Cambridge, I worked in the engineering shops, but drew up the schedule in Mittel- and Althochdeutsch for the Medieval Languages Tripos.<ref name=\"Pearson, Karl 1934 p. 20\">Pearson, Karl (1934).

Cambridge University Press, p. 20.</ref>}}\n\nIn his first book, ''The New Werther'', Pearson gives a clear indication of why he studied so many diverse subjects:\n\n{{quote|I rush from science to philosophy, and from philosophy to our old friends the poets; and then, over-wearied by too much idealism, I fancy I become practical in returning to science. Have you ever attempted to conceive all there is in the world worth knowing—that not one subject in the universe is unworthy of study? The giants of literature, the mysteries of many-dimensional space, the attempts of Boltzmann and Crookes to penetrate Nature's very laboratory, the Kantian theory of the universe, and the latest discoveries in embryology, with their wonderful tales of the development of life—what an immensity beyond our grasp! [...] Mankind seems on the verge of a new and glorious discovery. What Newton did to simplify the planetary motions must now be done to unite in one whole the various isolated theories of mathematical physics.<ref>Pearson, Karl (1880).

London: C, Kegan Paul & Co., pp. 6, 96.</ref>}}\n\nPearson then returned to London to study law so that he might, like his father, be called to the Bar. Quoting Pearson's own account:\n{{quote|Coming to London, I read in chambers in Lincoln's Inn, drew up bills of sale, and was called to the Bar, but varied legal studies by lecturing on heat at Barnes, on Martin Luther at Hampstead, and on [[Ferdinand Lassalle|Lassalle]] and Marx on Sundays at revolutionary clubs around Soho.<ref name=\"Pearson, Karl 1934 p. 20\"/>}}\n\nHis next career move was to the [[Inner Temple]], where he read law until 1881 (although he never practised). After this, he returned to mathematics, deputising for the mathematics professor at [[King's College, London]] in 1881 and for the professor at [[University College, London]] in 1883. In 1884, he was appointed to the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics at University College, London. Pearson became the editor of ''Common Sense of the Exact Sciences'' (1885) when [[William Kingdon Clifford]] died. 1891 saw him also appointed to the professorship of [[Geometry]] at [[Gresham College]]; here he met [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon]], a zoologist who had some interesting problems requiring quantitative solutions.<ref>Provine, William B. (2001). ''The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics''. University of Chicago Press, p. 29.</ref> The collaboration, in [[biometry]] and [[evolution]]ary theory, was a fruitful one and lasted until Weldon died in 1906.<ref>Tankard, James W. (1984). ''The Statistical Pioneers'', Schenkman Pub. Co.</ref> Weldon introduced Pearson to [[Charles Darwin]]'s cousin [[Francis Galton]], who was interested in aspects of evolution such as heredity and [[eugenics]]. Pearson became Galton's protégé—his \"statistical heir\" as some have put it—at times to the verge of [[Apotheosis|hero worship]].\n\nIn 1890 he married Maria Sharpe, and they had three children, Sigrid Loetitia Pearson, Helga Sharpe Pearson, and [[Egon Pearson]], who became an eminent statistician himself and succeeded his father as head of the Applied Statistics Department at University College. Maria died in 1928 and in 1929 Karl married Margaret Victoria Child, a co-worker at the Biometric Laboratory. He and his family lived at 7 Well Road in [[Hampstead]], now marked with a [[blue plaque]].<ref>[http://openplaques.org/plaques/230 \"Karl Pearson Blue Plaque,\"] at Openplaques.org.</ref>\n\nAfter Galton's death in 1911, Pearson embarked on producing his definitive biography—a three-volume tome of narrative, letters, genealogies, commentaries, and photographs—published in 1914, 1924, and 1930, with much of Pearson's own money paying for their print runs. The biography, done \"to satisfy myself and without regard to traditional standards, to the needs of publishers or to the tastes of the reading public\", triumphed Galton's life, work, and personal heredity. He predicted that Galton, rather than [[Charles Darwin]], would be remembered as the most prodigious grandson of [[Erasmus Darwin]].\n\nWhen Galton died, he left the residue of his estate to the [[University of London]] for a Chair in Eugenics. Pearson was the first holder of this chair—the ''Galton Chair of Eugenics'', later the ''Galton Chair of Genetics''<ref>Blaney, Tom (2011). ''The Chief Sea Lion's Inheritance: Eugenics and the Darwins''. Troubador Pub., p. 108. Also see Pearson, Roger (1991). ''Race, Intelligence and Bias in Academe''. Scott-Townsend Publishers.</ref>—in accordance with Galton's wishes. He formed the Department of Applied Statistics (with financial support from the [[Drapers' Company]]), into which he incorporated the Biometric and Galton laboratories. He remained with the department until his retirement in 1933, and continued to work until his death in 1936.\n\n==Einstein and Pearson's work==\nWhen the 23-year-old [[Albert Einstein]] started a study group, the [[Olympia Academy]], with his two younger friends, [[Maurice Solovine]] and Conrad Habicht, he suggested that the first book to be read was Pearson's ''[[The Grammar of Science]]''. This book covered several themes that were later to become part of the theories of Einstein and other scientists.<ref>Herbert, Christopher (2001). \"Karl Pearson and the Human Form Divine,\" in ''Victorian Relativity: Radical Thought and Scientific Discovery'', Chicago University Press, pp. 145–179.</ref> Pearson asserted that the laws of nature are relative to the perceptive ability of the observer. Irreversibility of natural processes, he claimed, is a purely relative conception. An observer who travels at the exact velocity of light would see an eternal now, or an absence of motion. He speculated that an observer who travelled faster than light would see time reversal, similar to a cinema film being run backwards. Pearson also discussed [[antimatter]], the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]], and wrinkles in time.\n\nPearson's [[principle of relativity|relativity]] was based on [[idealism]], in the sense of ideas or pictures in a [[mind]]. \"There are many signs,\" he wrote, \"that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude [[materialism]] of the older physicists.\" (Preface to 2nd Ed., ''[[The Grammar of Science]]'') Further, he stated, \"...science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind...\" \"In truth, the field of science is much more [[consciousness]] than an external world.\" (''Ibid.'', Ch. II, § 6) \"Law in the scientific sense is thus essentially a product of the human mind and has no meaning apart from man.\" (''Ibid.'', Ch. III, § 4)<ref>Pearson, Karl (1900).

Therefore, training benefits only the trained generation. Their children will not exhibit the learned improvements and, in turn, will need to be improved. \"No degenerate and feeble stock will ever be converted into healthy and sound stock by the accumulated effects of education, good laws, and sanitary surroundings. Such means may render the individual members of a stock passable if not strong members of society, but the same process will have to be gone through again and again with their offspring, and this in ever-widening circles, if the stock, owing to the conditions in which society has placed it, is able to increase its numbers.\"<ref>Pearson, Karl (1892).

If you want to know whether the lower races of man can evolve a higher type, I fear the only course is to leave them to fight it out among themselves, and even then the struggle for existence between individual and individual, between tribe and tribe, may not be supported by that physical selection due to a particular climate on which probably so much of the Aryan's success depended.\"<ref>Pearson, Karl (1901).

Among those who assisted Pearson in his research were a number of female mathematicians who included [[Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave]] and [[Frances Cave-Browne-Cave]]. He also founded the journal ''Annals of Eugenics'' (now ''[[Annals of Human Genetics]]'') in 1925. He published the ''[[Drapers' Company]] Research Memoirs'' largely to provide a record of the output of the Department of Applied Statistics not published elsewhere.\n\nPearson's thinking underpins many of the 'classical' statistical methods which are in common use today. Examples of his contributions are:\n\n*[[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Correlation coefficient]].
