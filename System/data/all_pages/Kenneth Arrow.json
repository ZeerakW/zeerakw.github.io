He is the joint winner of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] with [[John Hicks]] in 1972. To date, he is the youngest person to have received this award, at 51.\n\nIn economics, he is a figure in post-World War II [[Neo-classical economics|neo-classical economic theory]]. Many of his former graduate students have gone on to win the Nobel Memorial Prize themselves. \nHis most significant works are his contributions to [[social choice theory]], notably \"[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]\", and his work on [[general equilibrium]] analysis. He has also provided foundational work in many other areas of economics, including [[endogenous growth theory]] and [[asymmetric information|the economics of information]].\n\nArrow remains active on the international scene through a variety of initiatives including trustee of [[Economists for Peace and Security]] and a member of the Advisory Board of Incentives for Global Health, the not-for-profit behind the [[Health Impact Fund]].\n\n==Education and early career==\nArrow was born on August 23, 1921, in [[New York City]].

Arrow Papers, 1939–2009. |publisher=Rubenstein Library, Duke University}}</ref>\n\n==Contributions==\n\n===Arrow's impossibility theorem===\n{{Main|Arrow's impossibility theorem}}\nArrow's monograph ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'' derives from  his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis.\n\n{{quote|\"If we exclude the possibility of interpersonal comparisons of utility, then the only methods of passing from individual tastes to social preferences which will be satisfactory and which will be defined for a wide range of sets of individual orderings are either imposed or dictatorial.\"<ref>Kenneth Arrow, \"A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare\" (1950).</ref>}}\n\n[[Arrow's impossibility theorem|General Impossibility Theorem]]: It is impossible to formulate a social preference ordering that satisfies all of the following conditions:\n\n# '''Nondictatorship''': The preferences of an individual should not become the group ranking without considering the preferences of others.\n# '''Individual Sovereignty''': each individual should be able to order the choices in any way and indicate ties\n# '''Unanimity''': If every individual prefers one choice to another, then the group ranking should do the same\n# '''Freedom From Irrelevant Alternatives''': If a choice is removed, then the others' order should not change\n# '''Uniqueness of Group Rank''': The method should yield the same result whenever applied to a set of preferences.  The group ranking should be transitive.\n\nThe theorem has implications for [[welfare economics]] and theories of [[justice]]. It was extended by [[Amartya Sen]] to the [[liberal paradox]] which argued that given a status of \"Minimal Liberty\" there was no way to obtain [[Pareto optimality]], nor to avoid the problem of social choice of neutral but unequal results.\n\nAn example of this would be to have the following choices to divide a cake between three people. Let us call them A, B and C.\n\nChoice 1: A gets nothing, B and C get half each.<br />\nChoice 2: B gets nothing, A and C get half each.<br />\nChoice 3: C gets nothing, A and B get half each.<br />\nChoice 4: divide the cake equally.\n\nThus, if each person votes to get as much cake as possible, choice 4 would be third from the top in everyone's list, and would in any direct choice lose 2 to 1 against an unequal distribution. Since all of these choices are Pareto-optimal – no one's welfare can be improved without reducing the welfare of others – choice 4 would not be chosen, since there would always be other preferred choices.\n\n===General equilibrium theory===\n{{Main|General equilibrium theory|Arrow–Debreu model}}\nWorking with [[Gérard Debreu]],  Arrow produced the [[Arrow–Debreu model|first rigorous proof of the existence of a market clearing equilibrium]], given certain restrictive assumptions. For this work and his other contributions, Debreu won the Nobel prize in 1983. Arrow went on to extend the model and its analysis to include [[uncertainty#Concepts|uncertainty]], the [[Lipschitz continuity|stability]]. His contributions to the general equilibrium theory were strongly influenced by [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]''. Written in 1776, ''The Wealth of Nations'' is an examination of [[economic growth]] brought forward by the division of labor, by ensuring interdependence of individuals within society.<ref>Smith, Adam, and Andrew S. Skinner. The wealth of nations. London: Penguin Books, 1999. Print.</ref>\n\nIn 1974, The American Economic Association published the paper written by Kenneth Arrow, ''General Economic Equilibrium: Purpose, Analytic Techniques, Collective Choice'', where he states,  '“From the time of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations in 1776, one recurrent theme of economic analysis has been the remarkable degree of coherence among the vast numbers of individual and seemingly separate decisions about the buying and selling of commodities. In everyday, normal experience, there is something of a balance between the amounts of goods and services that some individuals want to supply and the amounts that other, different individuals want to sell. Would-be buyers ordinarily count correctly on being able to carry out their intentions, and would-be sellers do not ordinarily find themselves producing great amounts of goods that they cannot sell. This experience of balance indeed so widespread that it raises no intellectual disquiet among laymen; they take it so much for granted that they are not supposed to understand the mechanism by which it occurs.”'<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arrow |first=Kenneth |title=General Economic Equilibrium: Purpose, Analytic Techniques, Collective Choice |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=64 |issue=3 |year=1974 |pages=253–272 |jstor=1808881 }}</ref>\n\n===Fundamental theorems of welfare economics===\nHe presents the first and second [[fundamental theorems of welfare economics]] and their proofs without requiring differentiability of utility, consumption, or technology, and including corner solutions.\n\n===Endogenous-growth theory===\nArrow was researching [[endogenous growth theory|endogenous-growth theory]] (also known as ''new-growth theory''), which sought to explain the source of technical change, which is a key driver of economic growth. Until this theory came to prominence, technical change was assumed to occur [[exogenous]]ly – that is, it was assumed to occur outside economic activities, and was outside (exogenous) to common economic models. At the same time there was no economic explanation for ''why'' it occurred. Endogenous-growth theory provided standard economic reasons for why firms innovate, leading economists to think of innovation and technical change as determined by economic actors, that is [[endogenous]]ly to economic activities, and thus belong inside the model. A literature on this theory has developed subsequently to Arrow's work.\n\n===Information economics===\nIn other pioneering research, Arrow investigated the problems caused by [[asymmetric information]] in markets. In many transactions, one party (usually the seller) has more information about the product being sold than the other party. Asymmetric information creates incentives for the party with more information to cheat the party with less information; as a result, a number of market structures have developed, including [[warranty|warranties]] and third party [[authentication]], which enable markets with asymmetric information to function. Arrow analysed this issue for medical care (a 1963 paper entitled [http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/2/PHCBP.pdf \"Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care\"], in the American Economic Review); later researchers investigated many other markets, particularly second-hand assets, online auctions and insurance.\n\n==Awards and honors==\nArrow was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1959.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> He was the joint winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with John Hicks in 1972.
