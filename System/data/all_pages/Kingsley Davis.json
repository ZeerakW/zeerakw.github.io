He was identified by the [[American Philosophical Society]] as one of the most outstanding social scientists of the twentieth century, and was a [[Hoover Institution]] senior research fellow.  \n\n==Education and career==\nDavis received his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University]] and taught at [[Smith College]], [[Clark University]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Columbia University]], the [[University of California at Berkeley]] and the [[University of Southern California]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9029519 Kingsley Davis] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]</ref>\n\nAmong his other accomplishments, Davis\n* served as president of the Population Association of America and the [[American Sociological Association]]\n* represented the [[United States]] on the United Nations Population Commission\n* member of the Advisory Council of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] and the Advisory Committee on Population for the U.S. [[Bureau of the Census]]\n* was the first sociologist in the United States to be elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (1966).\n\nDavis won the Irene B. Taeuber Award for outstanding research in demography (1978), the Common Wealth Award for distinguished work in sociology (1979), and the Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award from the American Sociological Association (1982).<ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970305davisobit.html Obituary] at Stanford News</ref>\n\n==Research==\nDavis led and conducted major studies of societies in Europe, South America, Africa and Asia, coined the term \"[[population explosion]],\", and played a major role in the naming and development of the  [[demographic transition]] model.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9029519 Kingsley Davis] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]</ref><ref>[http://www.aps-pub.com/proceedings/1433/Davis.pdf Biography] from ''Proceedings of the [[American Philosophical Society]]''</ref> He was also one of the original scholars in the development of the theory of [[overurbanization]].<ref name=Sovani>Sovani, N.

Stolnitz (1955) ''Population Studies'', Vol. 9, No. 1. pp. 24-55</ref> \n\nDavis had several children while espousing limitations on childbearing world-wide. Davis also published an influential article with [[Wilbert E. Moore]] entitled \"Some Principles of Stratification,\"<ref>Davis, K, and Moore, W. E. \"Some principles of stratification.\" ''American Sociological Review,'' 10 (2), 242-49</ref> which was a very influential [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] account of the reasons for social inequality. Davis and Moore synthesize [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and [[Talcott Parsons|Parsons]] to argue for the \"[[The Davis-Moore hypothesis|functional necessity]]\" of some positions over others: those that are highest paid go to the most deserving individuals; at the same time, the differential rewards motivates individuals to work to fill positions they might otherwise not. Thus, from this perspective, illness is a deviant state because it means that the individual may not be able to fill their role. Sociologists see this article as a paradigmatic case of functionalist logic, and indeed, Davis came to be a leading figure in this school of sociology.<ref>De Maio, F. ''Health & Social Theory.''
