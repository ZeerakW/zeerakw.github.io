Bezdek is a [[professor]] as well as a [[Canada Research Chair]] (Tier 1) of [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Calgary]] in [[Calgary]], [[Canada]], and the director of the Center for Computational and Discrete Geometry (CCDG). He is also a [[professor]] of [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Pannonia]] in [[Hungary]]. He is the author of 2 books (research monographs) and more than 110 research papers. He is an Editor-in-Chief of the e-journal Contributions to Discrete Mathematics (CDM).\n\n==Early life and family==\nKároly Bezdek was born in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], but grew up in [[Dunaújváros]], [[Hungary]]. His parents are Károly Bezdek, Sr. (mechanical engineer) and Magdolna Cserey. His brother András Bezdek is also a mathematician. Károly and his brother have scored at the top level in several Mathematics and Physics competitions for high school and university students in Hungary. Károly's list of awards include winning the first prize in the traditional [[Középiskolai Matematikai és Fizikai Lapok|KöMal]] (Hungarian Math. Journal for Highschool Students) contest in the academic year 1972–1973, as well as winning the first prize for the research results presented at the National Science Conference for Hungarian Undergraduate Students (TDK) in 1978. Károly entered [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in Hungary, and completed his Diploma in Mathematics in 1978. Bezdek is married to Éva Bezdek, and has three sons: [[23199 Bezdek|Dániel]], [[25038 Matebezdek|Máté]] and Márk.\n\n==Professional accomplishments==\nKároly Bezdek received his [[Ph.D.]] (1980) as well as his Habilitation degree (1997) in mathematics from [[Eötvös Loránd University]], in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]  and his Candidate of Mathematical Sciences degree (1985) as well as his Doctor of \nMathematical Sciences degree (1995) from the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. He has been a faculty member of the Department of Geometry at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest since 1978. In particular, he has been the chair of that department between 1999-2006 and a full professor between 1998-2012. During 1978–2003, while being on a number of special leaves from [[Eötvös Loránd University]], he has held numerous visiting positions at research institutions in [[Canada]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[USA]]. This included a period of about 7 years at the Department of Mathematics of [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca]], New York. Between 1998-2001 Bezdek was appointed a [[Széchenyi]] Professor of mathematics at [[Eötvös Loránd University]], in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. From 2003 Károly Bezdek is the [[Canada Research Chair]] of computational and discrete geometry at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of the [[University of Calgary]] and is the director of the Center for Computational and Discrete Geometry at the [[University of Calgary]]. Between 2006-2010 Bezdek was an associated member of the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. From 2010 Bezdek is a full professor (on leave) at the Department of Mathematics of the [[University of Pannonia]] in [[Veszprém]], [[Hungary]]. Between July–December, 2011 Bezdek was a program co-chair of the 6 month thematic program on discrete geometry and its applications at the [[Fields Institute]] in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. Also, he is one of the three founding [[editor-in-chief|editors-in-chief]] of the free peer-reviewed electronic journal Contributions to Discrete Mathematics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cdm.math.ucalgary.ca/cdm/index.php/cdm/pages/view/editors.html| title =E-journal on Discrete Mathematics}}</ref>\n\n==Research interests and notable results==\nHis research interests are in [[combinatorial geometry|combinatorial]], [[computational geometry|computational]], [[convex geometry|convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] including some aspects of [[geometric analysis]], [[Rigidity (mathematics)|rigidity]] and [[optimization]]. He is the author of more than 110 research papers and has written two research monographs.
