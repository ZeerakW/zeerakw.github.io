His parents were [[Plymouth Brethren]]; he broke young from the family religion. He attended [[Tottenham County School]] in London, his family having moved to his mother's home town of [[Stoke Newington]] in 1907, and then as a medical student studied [[physiology]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref name=\"HogbenODNB\" /> He took his degree in 1915. He had acquired socialist convictions, changing the name of the university's [[Fabian Society]] to Socialist Society and went to become an active member of the [[Independent Labour Party]]. Later in life he preferred to describe himself as 'a scientific humanist'.<ref name=\"k&h\">\n[[Stanley Kunitz|Kunitz, Stanley J.]] and Haycraft, Howard ''Twentieth Century Authors, A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature'', (Third Edition). New York, The H.W. Wilson Company, 1950, (pp. 658–59)</ref>\n\n==First World War==\n\nIn the  [[First World War]] he was a [[pacifist]] and was imprisoned as a [[conscientious objector]] in 1916 at [[Wormwood Scrubs]]; this was after six months working with the [[Red Cross]] in France, and his deliberate return to Cambridge. His health collapsed and he was released in 1917.<ref name=\"frs\"/> Hogben married in 1918 the mathematician, statistician, and feminist [[Enid Charles]], with whom he had two sons and two daughters.<ref name=\"HogbenODNB\" />\n\n==Academic==\n\nAfter a year's convalescence he took lecturing positions in London universities, moving in 1922 to the [[University of Edinburgh]] and its Animal Breeding Research Department. He then went to [[McGill University]], and in 1927 to a zoology chair at the [[University of Cape Town]]. He worked on [[endocrinology]] and used the [[African clawed frog|Xenopus frog]]. While using Xenopus to investigate the endocrine system, he serendipitously discovered that female Xenopus frogs, when injected with urine from a pregnant woman, ovulated within hours. Thus, the Hogben Pregnancy Test was created and remained the major, international [[pregnancy test]] for decades. He found the job in South Africa attractive, but his antipathy to the country's [[South Africa under apartheid#Precursors of apartheid|racial policies]] drove him to leave.\n\nIn 1930 Hogben moved to the [[London School of Economics]], in a chair for [[Sociobiology|social biology]]. He became a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1936.<ref name=\"frs\"/> The citation read\n<blockquote>\nDistinguished for his work in Experimental Zoology, especially in respect of the mechanism of colour change in [[Amphibian|Amphibia]] and [[Reptile|Reptilia]]. He has published a series of important papers on the effect of [[hormone]]s on the pigmentary effector system and on the [[Biological life cycle|reproductive cycle]] of [[vertebrate]]s, and has worked on many branches of [[comparative physiology]]. More recently he has made substantial contributions to [[genetics]], especially with regard to man.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe social biology position at the [[London School of Economics]] was funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and when it withdrew funding Hogben moved to [[Aberdeen]], becoming [[Regius Professor]] of [[Natural history]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1937.\n\nHogben was granted both the Neill Prize, as well as a gold medal, for his work in mathematical genetics.<ref name=\"k&h\" />\n\n==Political views==\nWhile Chair for Social Biology at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]], Hogben unleashed a relentless attack on the British [[eugenics movement]], which was at its apex in the 1920s and 1930s. In contrast to eugenicists, who commonly drew a strict line between heredity (or nature) and environment (or nurture), Hogben highlighted the 'interdependence of nature and nurture'.<ref name=\"k&h\" /> Hogben's appeal to this interdependence of nature and nurture marked the first time [[gene-environment interaction]] (or 'gene-environment interplay') was used to undermine statistical attempts to partition the contributions of [[nature and nurture]], as well as the eugenic implications drawn from those statistics. Hogben's foil throughout this period was [[R.A. Fisher]], the leading scientist-eugenicist of the day (Tabery 2008).\n\nIn an interview for the book ''Twentieth Century Authors'', Hogben stated:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I like Scandinavians, skiing, swimming and socialists who realize it is our business to promote social progress by peaceful methods. I dislike football, economists, eugenicists, Fascists, [[Anti-Stalinist left|Stalinists]], and Scottish conservatives. I think that sex is necessary and bankers are not\".<ref name=\"k&h\" />\n</blockquote>\n\n==Society for Experimental Biology==\nIn 1923, Hogben was a founder of the [[Society for Experimental Biology]] and its organ the ''[[The Journal of Experimental Biology|British Journal of Experimental Biology]]'' (renamed ''Journal of Experimental Biology'' in 1930), along with [[Julian Huxley]] and geneticist [[Francis Albert Eley Crew]] (1886–1973). According to Gary Werskey, Hogben was the only one of the founders not holding any [[Eugenics|eugenic]] ideas.\n\n==Writer==\n\nHogben produced two best-selling works of popular science, ''Mathematics for the Million'' (1936) and ''Science for the Citizen'' (1938). While at Aberdeen, Hogben developed an interest in language. Besides editing ''The Loom of Language'' by his friend [[Frederick Bodmer]], he created an international language, [[Interglossa]], as 'a draft of an auxiliary for a democratic world order'.\n\n[[George Orwell]] in his essay [[Politics and the English Language]]<ref>http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm</ref> used a sentence of Hogben's as an example of how not to write, particularly in relation to the use of metaphors.\n\n{{quote|Above all, we cannot play ducks and drakes with a native battery of idioms which prescribes egregious collocations of vocables (...)|Orwell (1946), quoting Hogben, ''Interglossa'' (1943)}}\n{{quote|Professor Hogben plays ducks and drakes with a battery which is able to write prescriptions (...)|Orwell, ''Politics and the English Language'' (1946)}}\n\n==Later life==\n\nDuring [[World War II]] Hogben had responsibility for the [[British Army]]'s medical statistics. He was Mason Professor of Zoology at the [[University of Birmingham]] 1941–1947 and professor of medical statistics there 1947–1961, when he retired. In 1963, he became the first Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Guyana]], a post he abandoned in April 1964, resigning in 1965.\n\nIn the 1950s Hogben settled at [[Glyn Ceiriog]] in north Wales, where he bought a cottage. That decade his marriage to Enid broke down, the couple separated in 1953 and divorced in 1957, with Hogben remarrying later that year to local widowed retired school headmistress, (Mary) Jane Roberts (''nee'' Evans), who was seven years younger. Widowed by the death of Jane in 1974, he died at the War Memorial Hospital, [[Wrexham]].<ref name=\"HogbenODNB\" /> in 1975 aged 79 and was cremated at nearby [[Pentre Bychan]].<ref name=shropstar>{{cite news|work=Shropshire Star (Wrexham edition)|page=2 | date= 25 August 1975}}Death Notice.</ref>\n\n==Hogben's legacy==\nHogben's research has left a lasting impression on the history of biology. The [[African clawed frog]] ''(Xenopus laevis)'', which Hogben first developed as a model organism, is now one of the most widely used [[model organisms]] in biological research. Likewise, his emphasis on the interdependence of nature and nurture has had and continues to have an impact on scientific practice and scientific debate. In terms of scientific practice, modern research on [[phenotypic plasticity]], [[gene-environment interaction]], and [[developmental systems theory]] all owes much to the legacy of Hogben's initial emphasis on understanding [[nature and nurture]] interdependently rather than in dichotomy. In terms of scientific debate, the dispute between Hogben and [[R.A. Fisher]] over [[gene-environment interaction]] was the first of many subsequent disputes over the extent to which the primacy of the [[gene]] can be understood independently of its developmental relationship with the environment (Tabery 2007). The debate on [[nature and nurture]], the [[race and intelligence controversy]], the [[Heritability of IQ|heritability wars]], concerns over the geneticisation of complex human traits, and arguments over the promises and perils of the [[human genome project]] all incorporate some element of disagreement over the primacy of the gene. Hogben's attack on that primacy by appeal to the interdependence of nature and nurture has been echoed in each successive dispute.\n\n==The Hogben Archive==\nThe Lancelot Thomas Hogben papers are held in [http://www.special-coll.bham.ac.uk/ Special Collections], [[University of Birmingham]]. Archive highlights include a draft of his autobiography (later edited and published by his son Adrian Hogben and his wife), correspondence, hand drawn diagrams for his books, and reflections on his life and works.
