He left SPSS in 2008 and became Executive VP of SYSTAT Software Inc. in Chicago. He then served as the VP of Data Visualization at [[Skytree, Inc]], and joined Tableau in October 2014. His research focuses on [[scientific visualization]] and [[statistical graphics]].\n\n==Family life==\nHe is the son of Mr. and Mrs Kirk C.

In the 1970s and 1980s, he was a full-time faculty member at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (UIC). After serving 10 years as Adjunct Professor of Statistics at [[Northwestern University]], he rejoined UIC as Adjunct Professor of Computer Science.\n\nDr. Wilkinson is recognized as the primary author of the 1999 American Psychological Association's Guidelines for Statistical Methods in Psychology Journals.\n\n==Professional career==\n\nWilkinson wrote SYSTAT, a statistical software package, in the early 1980s.<ref>http://www.systat.com</ref> This program was noted for its comprehensive graphics,<ref>http://www.springerlink.com/content/x4u4r25k41l717l6/</ref> including the first software implementation of the [[heatmap]] display now widely used among biologists. After his company grew to 50 employees, he sold it to [[SPSS]] in 1995. At SPSS, he assembled a team of graphics programmers who developed the nViZn platform <ref>http://www.galaxy.gmu.edu/interface/I01/I2001Proceedings/LJones/LJones.pdf</ref> that produces the visualizations in [[SPSS]], [[SPSS Modeler|Clementine]], and other analytics products. The nViZn platform was modeled after Wilkinson's 1999 book on statistical graphics, ''The Grammar of Graphics''.<ref>Leland Wilkinson, ''The Grammar of Graphics'', Springer, 1999. ISBN 0-387-98774-6.
