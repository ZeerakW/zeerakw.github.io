He was the recipient of numerous honors and awards, and was a member of the [[National Academy of Science|United States National Academy of Science]].\n\nBreiman's work helped to bridge the gap between statistics and [[computer science]], particularly in the field of [[machine learning]]. His most important contributions were his work on [[decision tree learning|classification and regression trees]] and ensembles of trees fit to [[bootstrap (statistics)|bootstrap]] samples. [[Bootstrap aggregating|Bootstrap aggregation]] was given the name [[bootstrap aggregating|''bagging'']] by Breiman. Another of Breiman's ensemble approaches is the [[random forest]].\n\n== External links ==\n* Leo Breiman [http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/07/07_breiman.shtml obituary], from the University of California, Berkeley\n* Richard Olshen \"[http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Journal?authority=euclid.ss&issue=1009213285 A Conversation with Leo Breiman],\" Statistical Science Volume 16, Issue 2, 2001\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=32157}}\n*[http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/people/breiman.gif Leo Breiman] from [http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/people/welcome.htm PORTRAITS OF STATISTICIANS]\n*[http://videolectures.net/ecml03_breiman_teapb/ A video record] of a Leo Breiman's lecture about one of his machine learning techniques\n*{{Cite journal | last1 = Breiman | first1 = L. | title = Statistical Modeling: the Two Cultures | doi = 10.1214/ss/1009213725 | jstor = 2676681 | journal = Statistical Science | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 199–215 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Breiman, Leo\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = January 27, 1928\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[New York City]], [[USA]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = July 5, 2005\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Berkeley, California]], [[USA]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Breiman, Leo}}\n[[Category:1928 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:ISI highly cited researchers]]\n[[Category:Machine learning researchers]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty]]\n\n\n{{US-statistician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Leo Breiman"}}}}
