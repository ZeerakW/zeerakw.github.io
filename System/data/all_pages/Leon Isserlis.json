He also brought to the attention of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[statisticians]] the work of [[Russians|Russian]] mathematicians and statisticians, including [[Chebyshev]] and [[Alexander Alexandrovich Chuprov|Chuprov]].\n\nHe was born in [[Bohuslav|Boguslav]] near [[Kiev]] in June 1881 and was a direct descendant of the eminent [[rabbi]] [[Moses Isserles]]. He moved to Britain when he was ten years old with his widowed mother, an elder brother and two sisters. He attended the [[City of London School]] and won an open [[scholarship]] to study mathematics at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. Upon leaving Cambridge in 1904 he was appointed head of mathematics at the West Ham Municipal Technical Institute (one of the forerunners of the [[University of East London]]). He also registered as a research student at [[University College London]], where he studied under [[Karl Pearson]], and was awarded a [[D.Sc.]] in 1916. In March 1920 he moved to become statistician to the [[Chamber of Shipping]] and remained there until his retirement in 1942, when his position as statistician was taken by [[Maurice Kendall]].\n\nIn 1926 He wrote a review for the [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]] of [[R. A. Fisher]]'s seminal book ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]''. The review was rather critical, particularly of Fisher's lack of references to earlier work by others such as Chebyshev.\n\nHe was a friend of [[Major Greenwood]] and worked with him on statistical issues for the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]], although most of this work was anonymous and unpublished. He was also chairman of the [[Jewish Health Organization]] from 1931 to 1939. He served as secretary of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1934&ndash;35 and again in 1944&ndash;45, and was awarded its [[Guy Medal]] in Silver in 1939.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal|jstor=2982284|title=Leon Isserlis, M.A., D.Sc.
