He was a member of [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s [[Liberal Government 1880–1885|second administration]] from 1880 to 1883 and served as [[Chairman of Ways and Means]] (Deputy [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]) between 1886 and 1893.\n\n==Background and education==\nCourtney was born at [[Penzance]], Cornwall, the eldest son of John Sampson Courtney, a banker, and Sarah, daughter of John Mortimer.<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\">[http://thepeerage.com/p20381.htm#i203809 thepeerage.com Leonard Henry Courtney, 1st and last Baron Courtney of Penwith]</ref> Two of his brothers, [[John Mortimer Courtney]] (1838–1920), and [[William Prideaux Courtney]] (1845–1913), also attained public distinction, the former in the government service in Canada (from 1869, retiring in 1906), rising to be deputy-minister of finance, and the latter in the British civil service (1865–1892), and as a prominent man of letters and bibliographer. He was educated at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he was [[Second Wrangler]] and first [[Smith's prize]]man, and elected a fellow of his college.<ref>{{acad|id=CRTY851LH|name=Courtney, Leonard Henry}}</ref> He was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1858. From 1872 to 1875 he was professor of political economy at [[University College, London]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Leonard Courtney.jpg|left|thumb|200px|upright|\"Proper self-sufficiency\"<br>Caricature of Courtney by \"T\" ([[Théobald Chartran]]) in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]]'', 25 September 1880]]\n[[File:15 Cheyne Walk 02.JPG|left|thumb|200px|[[15 Cheyne Walk]], Chelsea, London, where Courtney was living at the time of his death]]\nIn December 1876, after a previous unsuccessful attempt, Courtney was elected to parliament for [[Liskeard (UK Parliament constituency)|Liskeard]] as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]. He continued to represent the borough, and [[Bodmin (UK Parliament constituency)|Bodmin]] into which it was merged by the [[Reform Act]] of 1885, until 1900, when his attitude towards the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] (he and his wife [[Catherine Courtney, Baroness Courtney of Penwith|Catherine]] were one of the foremost of the so-called Pro-[[Boer]] Party) compelled his retirement.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nUntil 1885, he was a devoted adherent of [[William Ewart Gladstone]], particularly in finance and foreign affairs. In 1880 he was appointed [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]], in 1881 [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]] and in 1882 [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]]. He was known as a stubborn fighter for principle, and after finding that the government's [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Reform Bill in 1884]] contained no recognition of the scheme for [[proportional representation]], to which he was deeply committed, he resigned office. He refused to support Gladstone's [[Home Rule Bill]] in 1886 and was one of those who chiefly contributed to its rejection, whose reputation for unbending integrity and intellectual eminence gave solidity to the [[Liberal Unionist]] party.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1886, Courtney was elected [[Chairman of Ways and Means]] (Deputy [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]) and was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] in 1889. His efficiency in this office seemed to mark him out for the speakership after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895 general election]]. A Liberal Unionist, however, could be elected only by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] votes, and he had made himself objectionable to a large section of the Conservative Party by his independent attitude on various questions, on which his liberalism outweighed his party loyalty. He, would in any case, have been incapacitated by an affection of the eyesight, which for a while threatened to withdraw him from public life altogether.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAfter 1895, Courtney's divergences from the Unionist party on questions other than Irish politics became gradually more marked. He became known in the House of Commons principally for his candid criticism of the measures introduced by his nominal leaders, and he was rather to be ranked among the Opposition than as a Ministerialist. When the crisis with the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] came in 1899, Courtney's views, which remained substantially what they were when he supported the settlement after [[Majuba]] in 1881, had plainly become incompatible with his position even as a nominal follower of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] and [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nHe led the work of the [[South African Conciliation Committee]] which brought the sufferings of the Boers to the attention of British people.<ref name=Brown>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Heloised|title=\"The truest form of patriotism\": pacifist feminism in Britain, 1870–1902|year=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0-7190-6531-3|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OAWv3HGUrc0C&lpg=PA170&dq=South%20African%20Conciliation%20Committee&pg=PA170#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=170}}</ref>\n\nHe gradually reverted to formal membership of the Liberal party and, in January 1906, unsuccessfully contested [[Edinburgh West (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh West]] as a supporter of Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] at the general election. Among the [[British honours system|birthday honours]] of 1906 he was elevated to the peerage as '''Baron Courtney of Penwith''', in the County of Cornwall.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27933 |date=20 July 1906 |startpage=4973 }}</ref>\n\nCourtney was a prominent supporter of the women's movement through the influence of his wife and sister-in-law. In his earlier years, he was a regular contributor to ''The Times'', and he wrote numerous essays in the principal reviews on political and economic subjects. In 1901 he published a book on ''The Working Constitution of the United Kingdom''. He was [[President of the Royal Statistical Society]], 1897-9.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rss.org.uk/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=486|title = Royal Statistical Society Presidents|publisher= Royal Statistical Society|accessdate = 6 August 2010}}</ref> He was a great friend of the artist [[Norman Garstin]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Leonard and Kate Courtney, c1916.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Courtney and his wife Catherine in 1916]]\nCourtney married [[Catherine Courtney, Baroness Courtney of Penwith|Catherine Potter]], daughter of Richard Potter and an elder sister of [[Beatrice Webb]], in 1883.
