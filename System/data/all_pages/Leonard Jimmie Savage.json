[[List of Nobel laureates in Economics|Nobel Prize-winning economist]] [[Milton Friedman]] said Savage was \"one of the few people I have met whom I would unhesitatingly call a genius.\"<ref>{{cite book | last1=Friedman | first1=Milton | last2=Friedman | first2=Rose | authorlink1=Milton Friedman | authorlink2=Rose Friedman | year=1998 | title=Two Lucky People: Memoirs | pages=146 | isbn=0-226-26414-9 | publisher=The University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago }}</ref>\n\nHe graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] and later worked at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[Yale University]], and the [[Applied Mathematics Panel|Statistical Research Group]] at [[Columbia University]].  Though his thesis advisor was [[Sumner Byron Myers|Sumner Myers]], he also credited Milton Friedman and [[W. Allen Wallis]] as statistical mentors.\n\nHis most noted work was the 1954 book ''Foundations of Statistics'', in which he put forward a theory of [[Subjective expected utility|subjective and personal probability]] and statistics which forms one of the strands underlying [[Bayesian statistics]] and has applications to [[game theory]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Savage served as chief \"statistical\" assistant to [[John von Neumann]], the mathematician credited with describing the principles upon which electronic computers should be based.<ref>{{cite book | last=Hacking | first=Ian | authorlink=Ian Hacking | year=2001 | title=An Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic | pages=184 | isbn=0-521-77287-7 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge }}</ref>\n\nOne of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of [[Louis Bachelier]] on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing. Savage brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of [[Paul Samuelson]]. It was from Samuelson's subsequent writing that \"random walk\" (and subsequently [[Brownian motion]]) became fundamental to [[mathematical finance]].\n\nIn 1951 he introduced the [[minimax regret]] criterion used in [[decision theory]].\n\nThe [[Hewitt–Savage zero-one law]] is (in part) named after him, as is the [[Friedman–Savage utility function]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Loss function]]\n*[[Friedman–Savage utility function]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MacTutor Biography|id=Savage}}\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=5192 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Savage, Leonard Jimmie\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 20 November 1917\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Detroit]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 1 November 1971\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[New Haven]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Savage, Leonard Jimmie}}\n[[Category:1917 births]]\n[[Category:1971 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Bayesian statisticians]]\n[[Category:University of Michigan alumni]]\n[[Category:Princeton University faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago faculty]]\n[[Category:Columbia University faculty]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]\n[[Category:Bayesian econometricians]]\n[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]\n[[Category:20th-century economists]]\n[[Category:Probability theorists]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Leonard Jimmie Savage"}}}}
