He was a faculty member at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] from 1962 through 2004, and in retirement was Professor [[Emeritus]] of Mathematics and Statistics.\n\nIt has been thought that, since classic red-and-black casino [[roulette]] is a game in which the house on average wins more than the gambler, that \"bold play\", i.e. betting one's whole purse on a single trial, is a uniquely optimal strategy.  While a graduate student at the [[University of Chicago]], Dubins surprised his teacher [[Leonard Jimmie Savage]] with a mathematical demonstration that this is not true.  Dubins and Savage wrote a book that appeared in 1965 titled ''How to Gamble if You Must (Inequalities for [[stochastic processes|Stochastic Processes]])'' which presented a mathematical theory of [[gambling]] processes and optimal behavior in gambling situations, pointing out their relevance to traditional approaches to probability.  Under the influence of the work of [[Bruno de Finetti]], Dubins and Savage worked in the context of [[finite additivity|finitely additive]] rather than [[countable additivity|countably additive]] probability theory, thereby bypassing some technical difficulties.<ref>David Gilat, Ted Hill, Bill Sudderth  [http://isi.cbs.nl/bs/obituary-lester-eli-dubins.htm \"Obituary for Lester Eli Dubins, 1920-2010\" ]</ref> <ref>http://www.bernoulli-society.org/index.php/news/38/85-obituary-for-lester-eli-dubins</ref>\n\nDubins was the author of nearly a hundred scholarly publications.  Besides probability, some of these were on curves of minimal length under constraints on curvature and initial and final tangents (see [[Dubins path]]), [[Tarski's circle squaring problem]], [[convex analysis]], and [[geometry]].\n\nHis doctorals students include [[Ted Hill (mathematician)|Theodore Hill]].\n\n==Publications==\n\n*{{cite book|title=How to gamble if you must: inequalities for stochastic processes\n |series=McGraw–Hill series in probability and statistics\n |first1=Lester E. |last1=Dubins |first2= Leonard J.|last2= Savage\n |publisher=McGraw–Hill|year= 1965 }}\nFirst Dover edition 1976, second Dover edition 2014.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathGenealogy|id=6447}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Dubins, Lester\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = April 27, 1920\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = February 11, 2010\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dubins, Lester}}\n[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:1920 births]]\n[[Category:2010 deaths]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty]]\n[[Category:People from New York City]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago alumni]]\n[[Category:Probability theorists]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Lester Dubins"}}}}
