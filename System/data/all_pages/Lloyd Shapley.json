He is a Professor Emeritus at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] ([[UCLA]]), affiliated with departments of Mathematics and Economics. He has contributed to the fields of [[mathematical economics]] and especially [[game theory]].\nSince the work of [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]] in 1940s, Shapley has been regarded by many experts as the very personification of game theory.<ref>''The Shapley Value: Essays in honor of Lloyd S.

Roth]], Shapley won the 2012 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] \"for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.\"<ref>[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2012/ Official announcement at Nobelprize.org]</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nLloyd Shapley was born on June 2, 1923, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], one of the sons of Martha (Betz) and the distinguished astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]], both from Missouri.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/27/obituaries/martha-betz-shapley.html</ref> He attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and was a student at Harvard when he was drafted in 1943. He served in the Army Air Corps in [[Chengdu, China]] and received the [[Bronze Star]] decoration for breaking the Soviet weather code.<ref>http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2012/shapley-interview.html</ref> After the war, he returned to Harvard and graduated with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in mathematics in 1948. After working for one year at the [[RAND Corporation]], he went to [[Princeton University]] where he received a Ph.D. in 1953.  His thesis and post-doctoral work introduced the [[Shapley value]] and the [[core (game theory)|core]] solution in [[game theory]].  After graduating, he remained at Princeton for a short time before going back to the RAND corporation from 1954 to 1981.  Since 1981 he has been a professor at [[UCLA]].\n\n==Contribution==\nAlong with the [[Shapley value]], [[stochastic games]], the [[Bondareva–Shapley theorem]] (which implies that [[convex set|convex]] games have non-empty cores), the [[Shapley–Shubik power index]] (for weighted or block voting power),  the [[Gale–Shapley algorithm]] (for the [[stable marriage problem]]), the concept of a [[potential game]] (with [[Dov Monderer]]), the [[Aumann–Shapley value|Aumann–Shapley]] pricing, the [[John Harsanyi|Harsanyi]]–Shapley solution, the [[Snow–Shapley theorem]] for matrix games, and the [[Shapley–Folkman lemma|Shapley–Folkman lemma & theorem]] bear his name.\n\nBesides, his early work with R.N.Snow and [[Samuel Karlin]] on [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] games was so complete that little has been added since. He has been instrumental in the development of [[utility theory]], and it was he who laid much of the groundwork for the solution of the problem of the existence of Von Neumann–Morgenstern stable sets. His work with [[Michael Maschler|M.Maschler]] and B.Peleg on the kernel and the nucleolus, and his work with [[Robert Aumann]] on non-atomic games and on long-term competition have all appeared in economic theory.\n\nIn his 80s, Shapley continued publishing in the areas of specialization he created or advanced, such as multi-person utility (with Manel Baucells) and authority distribution (a generalization to the [[Shapley–Shubik power index]] and useful in ranking, planning and group decision-making).\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*[[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], U.S. Army Air Corps, 1944\n*Procter Fellow, [[Princeton University]], 1951–52\n*Fellow, [[Econometric Society]], 1967\n*Fellow, [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 1974\n*Member, [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], 1979\n*[[John von Neumann Theory Prize]], 1981\n*Honorary Ph.D., [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], 1986\n*Fellow, INFORMS ([[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]]), 2002\n*Distinguished Fellow, [[American Economic Association]], 2007\n*Fellow, [[American Mathematical Society]], 2012<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-07-18.</ref>\n*Sveriges Riksbank [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], 2012\n*[[Golden Goose Award]], 2013<ref>{{cite web | title=Market Design | url=http://www.goldengooseaward.org/awardees/zfh0utmzft7uewzc3lscuvdp21ogw2 | publisher=The Golden Goose Award | accessdate=2015-05-27}}</ref>\n\n==Selected publications==\n*A Value for ''n''-person Games [1953], In ''Contributions to the Theory of Games'' volume II, H.W.
