He founded and was the scientific director of the Israel Institute of Applied Social Research, later renamed the Guttman Institute before finally becoming the [[Guttman Center]] (part of the [[Israel Democracy Institute]]).\n\n==Biography==\nGuttman was born in [[New York City]] on February 10, 1916 and grew up in the Jewish community of [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. Guttman received both his BA in 1936 and MA in 1939 at the [[University of Minnesota]], and his PhD in Social and Psychological Measurement in 1942.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1947 Guttman was professor of sociology at Cornell University, while as part of the World War II effort, he also served as an Expert Consultant to the US Army’s Research Branch. In 1947 Guttman and his wife Ruth emigrated to [[British Mandate for Palestine|Palestine]].\n\nHe was member of the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]], and foreign Honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and President of the [[Psychometric Society]]. In 1956 he was elected [[Stanford University]]: Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. In 1962 he received the [[Rothschild Prize]] and in 1971 [[Science (journal)|Science]] included Guttman in a list of the 62 most important contributors to scientific research in the social sciences since the beginning of the 20th century. Other awards were:\n*1974 Regents of the [[University of Minnesota]] - Outstanding Achievement Award\n*1978 [[Israel Prize]] in the [[social sciences]]<ref name=prize>{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site - Recipients in 1978 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashlag/Tashmab_Tashlag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashlach}}</ref>\n*1984 Educational Testing Service Measurement Award from [[Princeton University]].\n\nGuttman died on October 25, 1987, while on sabbatical in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], in the [[United States]].\n\n==Work==\nGuttman research interests were in the fields of scale analysis, facet theory. His work left a legacy of major developments in the theory and practice of [[scale analysis (mathematics)|scale]] and [[factor analysis]], [[multidimensional scaling]] and [[Facet (mathematics)|facet theory]]. His mathematical and philosophical treatments of Factor analysis are among the important parts of his scientific legacy.\n\nHis earlier work in scaling analysis produced what has become to be known as the [[Guttman scale]]. Notably, Guttman first proved several fundamental theorems in matrix algebra, as discussed in papers by Hubert, Meulman and Heiser (2000)<ref>{{cite book | author=Lawrence J. Hubert, Phipps Arabie, [[Jacqueline Meulman]] | title=Combinatorial Data Analysis: Optimization by Dynamic Programming | publisher=SIAM | year=2001 | isbn=978-0898714784}}</ref> and Takane and Yanai (2005). Several of Guttman’s contributions have been incorporated into computer packages, among them [[Multidimensional scaling|Smallest Space Analysis]] (SSA) and [[Partial Order Scalogram Analysis]] (POSAC).\n\nGuttman was described as a brilliant innovator who \"saw theory in method and method in theory\", was \"informed by high sophistication in mathematics, statistics, sociology and psychology\", and one who \"made a major contribution to democratic policy-making in the new state\" and “was concerned with the 'well-being' of individuals, groups and society\" <ref>(from a posthumous award ceremony by the World Association of Public Opinion Research, 1988).</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nGuttman published in numerous journals and books, including over 300 pages in [[Psychometric Society|Psychometrika]].  Many of his papers are still quoted in the scientific literature as being relevant and important to current statistical and mathematical advances.\n\nHis innovative methodological work on attitudes was published in the 4th volume of Studies in Social Psychology in World War II (more popularly called ''The American Soldier'' series, after the title of the first two volumes).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.idi.org.il/sites/english/TheGuttmanCenterSurveys/Pages/TheGuttmanCenter.aspx Guttman Center]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Guttman, Louis\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Israeli-American mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = February 10, 1916\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[New York City|New York]], [[New York]], [[United States]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = October 25, 1987\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], [[United States]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guttman, Louis}}\n[[Category:Israeli mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Israeli scientists]]\n[[Category:Israeli Jews]]\n[[Category:Jewish American scientists]]\n[[Category:Jewish scientists]]\n[[Category:University of Minnesota alumni]]\n[[Category:Cornell University faculty]]\n[[Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty]]\n[[Category:Zionists]]\n[[Category:Israel Prize in social sciences recipients]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:Members of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]\n[[Category:People from New York City]]\n[[Category:1916 births]]\n[[Category:1987 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Louis Guttman"}}}}
