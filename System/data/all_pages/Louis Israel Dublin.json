He came to the U.S. in 1886 with his parents Max and Sarah (Rosensweig).  Dublin obtained his bachelor's in 1901 at [[City College of New York]]. He earned his Ph.D. at [[Columbia University]] in 1904. He married Augusta Salik on April 5, 1908.  Dublin taught at [[Yale]] as a lecturer in [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]], and in 1924 served as [[president of the American Statistical Association]].\n\nHe died in Winter Park, Orange County, Florida at the age of 86{{Dubious|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Body Mass Index==\nWhile serving as a vice president at Met Life Insurance and as a statistician Dublin developed a height for weight table based on longevity of life insurance holders in the early 1940s. These tables would later develop into the Body Mass Index developed by [[University of Minnesota]]'s pioneering cholesterol and heart disease physiology researcher [[Ancel Keys]] in 1972. Keys intended the BMI to be used only for the study of groups and not to be applied to individuals. The index is statistically very limited in usefulness as covered a very limited demographic of people who were able to afford life insurance and who were mostly white.<ref>http://www.scienceofeds.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pekar-ims-bmi.pdf</ref>\n\n==Major works==\n*Louis Israel Dublin, Alfred J.
