Thurstone originally received a masters in [[mechanical engineering]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1912. Thurstone was offered a brief assistantship in the laboratory of [[Thomas Edison]]. In 1914,\nafter two years as an instructor of geometry and drafting at the [[University of Minnesota]], he enrolled as a graduate student in psychology at the [[University of Chicago]] (Ph.D., 1917). He later returned to the University of Chicago (1924–1952) where he taught and conducted research. In 1952, he established the [http://www.unc.edu/depts/quantpsy/thurstone/  L. L. Thurstone Psychometric Laboratory] at the [[University of North Carolina]] at [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]].<ref>''Swedes In America'' (Benson, Adolph B.; Naboth Hedin. New York: Haskel House Publishers. 1969)</ref><ref>[http://www.unc.edu/depts/quantpsy/thurstone/ ''L. L. Thurstone Psychometric Laboratory''  (University of North Carolina)]</ref>\n\n==Factor analysis and work on intelligence==\nThurstone was responsible for the standardized mean and [[standard deviation]] of [[IQ]] scores used today, as opposed to the [[Intelligence Test]] system originally used by [[Alfred Binet]]. He is also known for the development of the [[Thurstone scale]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.122.3183.1259 |title=L. L. Thurstone and the Science of Human Behavior |year=1955 |last1=Horst |first1=P. |journal=Science |volume=122 |pages=1259–60 |pmid=13274085 |issue=3183}}</ref>\n\nThurstone's work in factor analysis led him to formulate a model of intelligence center around \"Primary Mental Abilities\" (PMAs), which were independent group factors of intelligence that different individuals possessed in varying degrees. He opposed the notion of a singular [[general intelligence factor|general intelligence]] that factored into the scores of all psychometric tests and was expressed as a [[mental age]]. In 1935 Thurstone, together with [[EL Thorndike]] and [[JP Guilford]] founded the journal Psychometrika and also the Psychometric Society, going on to become the society's first President in 1936. Thurstone's contributions to methods of factor analysis have proved invaluable in establishing and verifying later psychometric factor structures, and has influenced the hierarchical models of intelligence in use in intelligence tests such as [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]] and the modern [[Stanford-Binet IQ test]].<ref>[http://www.psych.usyd.edu.au/difference5/scholars/thurstone.html ''Louis Leon Thurstone, 1887-1955'' (Individual Differences Homepage)]</ref>\n\nThe seven primary mental abilities in Thurstone's model were ''verbal comprehension'', ''word fluency'', ''number facility'', ''spatial visualization'', ''associative memory'', ''perceptual speed'' and ''reasoning''.\n\n==Contributions to measurement==\nDespite his contributions to factor analysis, Thurstone (1959, p.&nbsp;267) cautioned: \"When a problem is so involved that no rational formulation is available, then some quantification is still possible by the coefficients of correlation of contingency and the like. But such statistical procedures constitute an acknowledgement of failure to rationalize the problem and to establish functions that underlie the data. We want to measure the separation between the two opinions on the attitude continuum and we want to test the validity of the assumed continuum by means of its internal consistency\". Thurstone's approach to measurement was termed the [[law of comparative judgment]]. He applied the approach in [[psychophysics]], and later to the [[measurement]] of psychological values. The so-called 'Law', which can be regarded as a measurement model, involves subjects making a [[Pairwise comparison|comparison]] between each of a number of pairs of stimuli with respect to magnitude of a property, attribute, or attitude. Methods based on the approach to measurement can be used to estimate such scale values.<ref>''Louis Leon Thurstone 1887-1955''  (J. P. Guilford O National Academy of Science. 1957)[http://www.nap.edu/html/biomems/lthurstone.pdf]</ref>\n\nThurstone's Law of comparative judgment has important links to modern approaches to social and psychological measurement. In particular, the approach bears a close conceptual relation to the [[Rasch model]] (Andrich, 1978), although Thurstone typically employed the [[normal distribution]] in applications of the Law of comparative judgment whereas the Rasch model is a simple [[logistic function]]. Thurstone anticipated a key [[epistemological]] requirement of measurement later articulated by Rasch, which is that relative scale locations must 'transcend' the group measured; i.e. scale locations must be invariant to (or independent of) the particular group of persons instrumental to comparisons between the stimuli. Thurstone (1929) also articulated what he referred to as the ''additivity criterion'' for scale differences, a criterion which must be satisfied in order to obtain interval-level measurements.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/louis-leon-thurstone ''Louis Leon Thurstone Biography'' (LoveToKnow, Corp.)]</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nThurstone received numerous awards, including:  Best Article, [[American Psychological Association]] (1949); Centennial Award, [[Northwestern University]] (1951); Honorary Doctorate, [[University of Göteborg]] (1954). Thurstone was President of [[American Psychological Association]] (1933) and first President of the  American Psychometric Society  (1936).<ref>[http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/lthurstone.shtml  ''L.L.
