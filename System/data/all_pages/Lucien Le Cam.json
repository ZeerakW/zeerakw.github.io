His parents were farmers, and unable to afford higher education for him; his father died when he was 13. After graduating from a Catholic school in 1942, he began studying at a seminary in [[Limoges]], but immediately quit upon learning that he would not be allowed to study chemistry there. Instead he continued his studies at a lycée, which did not teach chemistry but did teach mathematics. In May 1944 he joined an underground group, and then went into hiding, returning to his school the following November but soon afterwards moving to Paris, where he began studying at the [[University of Paris]]. He graduated in 1945 with the degree Licence es Sciences.<ref name=\"imstat\">{{citation|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927225921/http://www.imstat.org/BULLETIN/sept2000/node18.html|title=Obituary: Lucien Le Cam, November 18, 1924 - April 25, 2000|journal=IMSTAT Bulletin|date=September 2000}}</ref><ref name=\"mmp\">{{citation|contribution=Lucien Le Cam|title=More Mathematical People|editor1-first=Donald J.|editor1-last=Albers|editor2-first=Gerald L.|editor2-last=Alexanderson|editor2-link=Gerald L.

In 1950, he was invited to become an instructor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]];<ref name=\"imstat\"/> he arrived that Fall, with his original plan being to stay there a year on leave from his utility position. By the spring of 1951, he had met his future wife (Louise Romig, the daughter of statistician [[Harry Romig]]), decided to stay longer, and been admitted to the Ph.D. program.<ref name=\"mmp\"/> He obtained his Ph.D. in 1952,<ref>{{MathGenealogy |id=32891 }}</ref> was appointed Assistant Professor in 1953 and continued working at Berkeley (except for a year in [[Montreal]]) beyond his retirement in 1991 until his death.<ref name=\"imstat\"/><ref>[http://www.stat.yale.edu/~pollard/Paris2001/LeCam-vita.pdf Lucien Le Cam cv], accessed 2013-05-07.</ref>\n\n==Contributions==\nLe Cam was the major figure during the period 1950 &ndash; 1990 in the development of abstract general asymptotic theory in mathematical statistics.  He is best known for the general concepts of ''[[local asymptotic normality]]'' and ''[[contiguity (probability theory)|contiguity]]'', and for developing a metric theory of statistical experiments, recounted in his 1986 magnum opus ''Asymptotic Methods in Statistical Decision Theory''.\n\n==Selected publications==\n* {{cite book\n|first=Lucien\n|last=Le Cam <!-- |authorlink=Lucien Le Cam -->\n|title = Asymptotic Methods in Statistical Decision Theory\n|year = 1986\n|publisher = Springer-Verlag\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|first=Lucien\n|last=Le Cam  <!-- |authorlink=Lucien Le Cam -->\n  |author2=Lo Yang, Grace\n  | title = Asymptotics in statistics: some basic concepts\n  | year = 2000\n  | publisher = Springer\n  | isbn = 0-387-95036-2\n  | ref = CITEREFLeCam2000\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Le Cam | first = Lucien <!-- | authorlink = Lucien Le Cam -->\n  | title = Maximum likelihood — an introduction\n  | journal = ISI Review\n  | volume = 58 | issue = 2\n  | year = 1990\n  | pages = 153–171\n  | doi=10.2307/1403464\n  }}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Additional reading==\n*{{citation|first=Grace L.|last=Yang|year=1999|title=A Conversation with Lucien Le Cam|journal=Statistical Science|volume=14|issue=2|pages=223–241|url=http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Journal?authority=euclid.ss&issue=1009212241|doi=10.1214/ss/1009212249}}.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/rice/LeCam/index.html In Memory of Lucien Le Cam]\n* [http://owpdb.mfo.de/person_detail?id=5493 Oberwolfach Photo Collection, 1973]\n* [http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/people/le_cam.gif Lucien Le Cam], Portraits of Statisticians\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Le Cam, Lucien\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = French mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = November 18, 1924\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Croze, [[Creuse]], [[France]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = April 25, 2000\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Le Cam, Lucien}}\n[[Category:Presidents of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]\n[[Category:French statisticians]]\n[[Category:Probability theorists]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty]]\n[[Category:20th-century French mathematicians]]\n[[Category:1924 births]]\n[[Category:2000 deaths]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Lucien Le Cam"}}}}
