After a period as a teacher in [[Łódź]] he became professor of synthetic geometry at [[Dresden]] where his growing interest in kinematics culminated in his ''Lehrbuch der Kinematik, Erster Band, Die ebene Bewegung'' (Textbook of Kinematics, First Volume, Planar Motion) of 1888, developing the approach to the theory of [[linkage (mechanical)|linkage]]s introduced by [[Franz Reuleaux]], whereby a planar mechanism was understood as a collection of Euclidean planes in relative motion with one [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]]. Burmester considered both the theory of planar kinematics and practically all actual mechanisms known in his time. In doing so, Burmester developed [[Burmester theory]] which applies [[projective geometry]] to the loci of points on planes moving in straight lines and in circles, where any motion may be understood in relation to four Burmester points.<ref>Ceccarelli and Koetsier, ''Burmester and Allevi: A Theory and its Application for Mechanism Design at the end of 19th Century, Proceedings of IDETC/CIE 2006 ASME 2006 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference'' [http://webuser.unicas.it/weblarm/file%20pdf/327-burmester&allieviDETC2006-99165.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe Burmester linkage of 1888 is a four bar linkage part of whose coupler curve is an approximately straight line (see also [[Watt's linkage]]).\n\nA [[French curve]] may also be known as a Burmester curve.\n\n==References==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Ludwig Ernst Hans Burmester}}\n* [http://gtrebaol.free.fr/doc/flash/four_bar/doc/ Burmester linkage (see figure 12)]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n<!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n{{Persondata\n|NAME              = Burmester, Ludwig Ernst Hans\n|ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n|SHORT DESCRIPTION = German kinematician and geometer\n|DATE OF BIRTH     = 5 May 1840\n|PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Othmarschen]]\n|DATE OF DEATH     = 20 April 1927\n|PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Munich]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burmester, Ludwig}}\n[[Category:1840 births]]\n[[Category:1927 deaths]]\n[[Category:Geometers]]\n[[Category:19th-century German mathematicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century German mathematicians]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Ludwig Burmester"}}}}
