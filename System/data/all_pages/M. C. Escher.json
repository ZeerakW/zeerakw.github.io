He travelled in Italy and Spain, sketching buildings, townscapes, architecture and the tilings of the [[Alhambra]] and [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|La Mezquita]], Cordoba, and became steadily more interested in their mathematical structure.\n\nHis work features mathematical objects and operations including [[impossible object]]s, explorations of [[infinity]], [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], [[symmetry]], [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[Truncation (geometry)|truncated]] and [[Stellation|stellated polyhedra]], [[hyperbolic geometry]], and [[tessellation]]s. Although Escher considered that he had no mathematical ability, he both interacted with the practising mathematicians [[George Pólya]], [[Roger Penrose]], and [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|Harold Coxeter]], read mathematical papers by these authors and by the crystallographer [[Friedrich Haag]], and conducted his own mathematical research into tessellation.\n\nEscher's art became popular, both among scientists and mathematicians, and in popular culture. Apart from being used in a variety of technical papers, his work has appeared on the covers of many books and albums. He featured as one of the major inspirations of [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s 1979 book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]''.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Leeuwarden - Keramiekmuseum Princessehof.jpg|thumb|Escher's birth house, now part of the [[Princessehof Ceramics Museum]], in [[Leeuwarden]], [[Netherlands]]]]\n\nMaurits Cornelis{{efn|\"We named him Maurits Cornelis after S.'s [Sara's] beloved uncle Van Hall, and called him 'Mauk' for short&nbsp;...\", Diary of Escher's father, quoted in ''M.

In the same year he traveled through Spain, visiting [[Madrid]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and [[Granada]].<ref name=Chronology/> He was impressed by the Italian countryside, and in Granada by the [[Moorish architecture]] of the fourteenth-century [[Alhambra]]. The intricate decorative designs of the Alhambra, based on [[Geometry|geometrical]] [[Symmetry|symmetries]] featuring interlocking repetitive patterns in the coloured tiles or sculpted into the walls and ceilings, triggered his interest in the mathematics of [[tessellation]], and became a powerful influence on his work.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roza |first=Greg |title=An Optical Artist: Exploring Patterns and Symmetry |year=2005 |publisher=Rosen Classroom |isbn=978-1-4042-5117-5 |page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Monroe |first=J.

While in Italy, Escher met Jetta Umiker, whom he married in 1924. The couple settled in Rome where their first son, Giorgio (George) Arnaldo Escher, named after his grandfather, was born. Escher and Jetta later had two more sons: Arthur and Jan.<ref name=Chronology/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~paul/escher.html |title=Escher |publisher=Geom.uiuc.edu |date= |accessdate=7 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe travelled frequently, visiting (among other places) [[Viterbo]] in 1926, the [[Abruzzo|Abruzzi]] in 1927 and 1929, [[Corsica]] in 1928 and 1933, [[Calabria]] in 1930, the [[Amalfi]] coast in 1931 and 1934, [[Cargano]] and [[Sicily]] in 1932 and 1935. The townscapes and landscapes of these places feature prominently in his artworks. In May and June 1936, Escher travelled back to Spain, revisiting the Alhambra and spending days at a time making detailed drawings of its mosaic patterns. It was here that he became fascinated to the point of obsession with tessellation, explaining:<ref name=\"Locher 1974 5\"/><ref name=StAndrews/>\n\n{{quote|It remains an extremely absorbing activity, a real mania to which I have become addicted, and from which I sometimes find it hard to tear myself away.<ref name=StAndrews/>}}\n\nThe sketches he made in the Alhambra formed a major source for his work from that time on.<ref name=StAndrews/> He also studied the architecture of the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|Mezquita]], the Moorish mosque of Cordoba. This turned out to be the last of his long study journeys; after 1937, his artworks were created in his studio rather than in the field. His art correspondingly changed sharply from being mainly observational, with a strong emphasis on the realistic details of things seen in nature and architecture, to being the product of his geometric analysis and his visual imagination. All the same, even his early work already shows his interest in the nature of space, the unusual, perspective, and multiple points of view.<ref name=\"Locher 1974 5\"/><ref name=StAndrews/>\n\n==Later life==\n\nIn 1935, the political climate in Italy (under [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]) became unacceptable to Escher. He had no interest in politics, finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium, but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy. When his eldest son, George, was forced at the age of nine to wear a [[Opera Nazionale Balilla|Ballila]] uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to [[Château-d'Œx]], Switzerland, where they remained for two years.<ref>Ernst, Bruno, '' The Magic Mirror of M.C.

Escher)|Snakes]]'', 1969]]\n\nEscher, who had been very fond of and inspired by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to [[Uccle]], a suburb of [[Brussels]], Belgium.<ref name=Chronology/> [[World War II]] forced them to move in January 1941, this time to [[Baarn]], Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970.<ref name=Chronology/> Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work.<ref name=Chronology/> After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time,<ref name=Chronology/> but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published as part of the book ''Escher on Escher''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Escher, M.

Escher)|Snakes]]'', in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings. These shrink to infinity toward both the center and the edge of a circle. It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using three blocks, each rotated three times about the center of the image and precisely aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print. The image encapsulates Escher's love of symmetry, of interlocking patterns, and at the end of his life, of his approach to infinity.<ref>Locher, 1974. p. 151</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Snakes |url=http://www.mcescher.com/gallery/recognition-success/snakes/ |website=M.

This has caused a disconnect between his full-on popular fame and the reserve or lack of esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world. His originality and mastery of graphic techniques is respected, but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical. The advent of movements such as [[conceptual art]] has to a degree reversed the art world's attitude to the intellectual and the lyrical in art, but this did not rehabilitate Escher because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective. However, these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public.<ref name=Locher13>Locher, 1974. p. 13</ref> Escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes: [[Parmigianino]] (1503–1540) had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his 1524 ''[[Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror]]'', depicting his own image in a curved mirror, while [[William Hogarth]]'s 1754 ''[[Satire on False Perspective]]'', foreshadows Escher's playful exploration of errors in perspective.<ref>Locher, 1974. pp. 11–12</ref><ref name=NGA/> Another early artistic forerunner is [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] (1720–1778), whose dark \"fantastical\"<ref name=Carnegie/> prints such as ''The Drawbridge'' in his ''Carceri'' (\"Prisons\") sequence depict perspectives into complex architecture with many stairs and ramps, peopled by walking figures.<ref name=Carnegie>{{cite web |last1=Altdorfer |first1=John |title=Inside A Fantastical Mind |url=http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmag/article.php?id=123 |publisher=Carnegie Museums |accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=McStay |first1=Chantal |title=Oneiric Architecture and Opium |url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/giovanni-battista-piranesi/ |publisher=The Paris Review |accessdate=7 November 2015 |date=15 August 2014}}</ref> Only with 20th century movements such as [[Cubism]], [[De Stijl]], [[Dada]]ism and [[Surrealism]] did mainstream art start to explore Escher-like ways of looking at the world with multiple simultaneous viewpoints.<ref name=Locher13/> However, while Escher had much in common with, for example, [[Magritte]]'s surrealism, he did not make contact with any of these movements.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mansfield |first1=28 June 2015 |title=Escher, the master of impossible art |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/arts/visual-arts/escher-the-master-of-impossible-art-1-3815073#axzz3qnqdWYGr|publisher=The Scotsman|accessdate=7 November 2015 |date=28 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=200px heights=200px mode=nolines>\n\nFile:Parmigianino Selfportrait.jpg|Forerunner of Escher's [[Curvilinear perspective|curved perspectives]], geometries, and reflections: [[Parmigianino]]'s ''[[Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror]]'', 1524\nFile:Piranesi9c.jpg|Forerunner of Escher's fantastic endless stairs: [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]]'s ''Carceri'' Plate VII – The Drawbridge, 1745, reworked 1761\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Tessellation===\n{{further|Tessellation}}\n\nIn his early years, Escher sketched landscapes and nature. He also sketched insects such as [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, [[grasshopper]]s and [[mantis]]es,<ref>Locher, 1974. pp. 62–63</ref> which appeared frequently in his later work. His early love of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and Italian landscapes and of nature created an interest in [[tessellation]], which he called ''[[Regular Division of the Plane]]''; this became the title of his 1958 book, complete with reproductions of a series of woodcuts based on tessellations of the plane, in which he described the systematic buildup of mathematical designs in his artworks. He wrote \"[[Mathematician]]s have opened the gate leading to an extensive domain.\"<ref name=\"Peterson's2012\">{{cite book |author=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=m8lB8OWyVpsC&pg=PT119&lpg=PT119 |title=Master the GRE 2013 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m8lB8OWyVpsC&pg=PT119 |year=2012 |publisher=Peterson's |isbn=978-0-7689-3681-0 |page=119}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Study of Regular Division of the Plane with Reptiles.jpg|thumb|right|Hexagonal tessellation with animals: ''Study of Regular Division of the Plane with Reptiles'' (1939).

He then extended these to form complex interlocking designs, for example with animals such as [[bird]]s, [[fish]], and [[reptile]]s.<ref>Locher, 1974. pp. 79–85</ref> One of his first attempts at a tessellation was his pencil, India ink and watercolour ''Study of Regular Division of the Plane with Reptiles'' (1939), constructed on a [[hexagon]]al grid. The heads of the red, green and white reptiles meet at a vertex; the tails, legs and sides of the animals exactly interlock. It was used as the basis for his 1943 lithograph ''[[Reptiles (M. C. Escher)|Reptiles]]''.<ref>Locher, 1974. p. 18</ref>\n\nHis first study of mathematics began with papers by [[George Pólya]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pólya, G. |authorlink=George Pólya |title=Über die Analogie der Kristallsymmetrie in der Ebene |journal=Zeitschrift fuer Kristallographie |volume=60 |year=1924 |pages=278–282 |language=German}}</ref> and by the crystallographer [[Friedrich Haag]]<ref name=Haag>{{cite journal |author=Haag, Friedrich |url=http://www2.dm.unito.it/paginepersonali/ferrarese/varia/Haag1911Kristallographie.pdf |title=Die regelmäßigen Planteilungen |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift fuer Kristallographie |volume=49 |year=1911 |pages=360–369}}</ref> on plane [[symmetry group]]s, sent to him by his brother [[Berend George Escher|Berend]] (known as Beer).<ref name=MathSide/> He carefully studied the 17 [[wallpaper group]]s, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of [[symmetry]].{{efn|Escher made it clear that he did not understand the abstract concept of a group, but he did grasp the nature of the 17 wallpaper groups in practice.<ref name=StAndrews/>}} From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His ''[[Metamorphosis I]]'' (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In ''Metamorphosis I'', he transformed [[convex polygon]]s into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece ''[[Metamorphosis III]]'', which is four metres long.<ref name=StAndrews/><ref>Locher, 1974. p. 84</ref>\n\nIn 1941 and 1942, Escher summarized his findings for his own artistic use in a sketchbook, which he labeled (following Haag) ''Regelmatige vlakverdeling in asymmetrische congruente veelhoeken'' (\"Regular division of the plane with asymmetric congruent polygons\").<ref>{{cite book |title=What's Happening in the Mathematical Sciences, Volume 4 |author=Barry Cipra |editor=Paul Zorn |publisher=American Mathematical Society |page=103 |year=1998 |isbn=0-8218-0766-8}}</ref> The mathematician Doris Schattschneider unequivocally described this notebook as recording \"a methodical investigation that can only be termed mathematical research.\"<ref name=MathSide/> She defined the research questions he was following as\n\n{{quote|(1) What are the possible shapes for a tile that can produce a regular division of the plane, that is, a tile that can fill the plane with its congruent images such that every tile is surrounded in the same manner?<br>(2) Moreover, in what ways are the edges of such a tile related to each other by isometries?<ref name=MathSide/>}}\n\n===Geometries===\n{{further|perspective (geometry)|curvilinear perspective}}\n\n[[File:Escher's Relativity.jpg|thumb|left|Multiple viewpoints and impossible stairs: ''[[Relativity (M.

His first print of an impossible reality was ''[[Still Life and Street]]'' (1937); impossible stairs and multiple visual and gravitational perspectives feature in popular works such as ''[[Relativity (M.

In 1956 they published a paper, \"Impossible Objects: A Special Type of Visual Illusion\" and later sent Escher a copy. Escher replied, admiring the Penroses' continuously rising flights of steps, and enclosed a print of ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' (1960).

The critic Steven Poole commented that<ref name=Poole/>\n\n{{quote|It is a neat depiction of one of Escher's enduring fascinations: the contrast between the two-dimensional flatness of a sheet of paper and the illusion of three-dimensional volume that can be created with certain marks.

Inspired by ''Relativity'', Penrose devised his [[Penrose tribar|tribar]], and his father, Lionel Penrose, devised an endless staircase.

Upon Escher's death, his three sons dissolved the Foundation, and they became partners in the ownership of the art works. In 1980, this holding was sold to an American art dealer and the Hague Museum. The Museum obtained all of the documentation and the smaller portion of the art works.
