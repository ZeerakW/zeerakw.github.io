In 1929, he won a scholarship to [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] where he read [[mathematics]], graduating with the rank of [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]]. He attended lectures on statistics by [[John Wishart (statistician)|John Wishart]], on [[theory of relativity|relativity]] by [[Arthur Eddington]] and on [[quantum mechanics]] by [[Paul Dirac]]. In one of his lectures Wishart described his geometric derivation of the Wishart distribution. Overnight Bartlett worked out a proof using characteristic functions. Bartlett was Wishart's first post-graduate student and they wrote two papers together. This was the beginning of Bartlett's involvement with multivariate analysis. During his Queens years, he [[rowing (sport)|rowed]] for the college.\n\nIn 1933, Bartlett was recruited by [[Egon Pearson]] to the new statistics department at [[University College, London]]. Pearson was already working with [[Jerzy Neyman]]. Also in the college were [[Ronald A. Fisher]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane]]. Bartlett was stimulated by all of them, most of all by the work of Fisher, criticising some of it (for example,  [[fiducial inference]]) while developing other parts (for example [[conditional inference]]). Relations between the two men fluctuated; sometimes Bartlett was in Fisher's good books, but often not. In 1934, Bartlett became statistician at the [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] agricultural research station at Jealott's Hill. Not only did he deal with practical problems but he worked on statistical theory, as well as on problems in [[genetics]] but he became interested in the characterisation of [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]]. He remembered Jealott's Hill as the best working environment of his career. Bartlett left ICI for the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1938 but at the outset of [[World War II]] was mobilised into the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]], conducting [[rocket]] research alongside [[Frank Anscombe]], [[David George Kendall|David Kendall]] and [[Patrick Alfred Pierce Moran|Pat Moran]].\n\nAfter the war Bartlett's renewed Cambridge work focused on [[time-series analysis]] and [[stochastic process]]. With [[José Enrique Moyal|Jo Moyal]] he planned a large book on probability, but the collaboration did not work out and Bartlett went ahead and published his own book on stochastic processes. He made a number of visits to the [[USA]]. In 1947 he became professor of mathematical statistics at the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] where he not only developed his interests in [[epidemiology]] but also served as an able and active administrator. In 1960, he took up the chair of statistics at [[University College, London]] before serving the last eight years of his academic life as professor of biomathematics at the [[University of Oxford]]. He retired in 1975.\n\nAfter his retirement Bartlett remained active in statistics, visiting the Institute of Advanced Studies at the [[Australian National University]] several times. He had married Sheila, daughter of C. E. Chapman, in 1957, the couple parenting a daughter. Bartlett died in [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]], [[Devon]].\n\nBartlett is known for [[Bartlett's method]] for estimating [[power spectrum|power spectra]] and [[Bartlett's test]] for [[homoscedasticity]].\n\n==Honours==\n*[[Smith's Prize|Rayleigh Prize]], (1933);\n*[[Guy Medal]]s in Silver (1952) and Gold (1969) of the [[Royal Statistical Society]];\n*President of the [[Manchester Statistical Society]], (1959–1960);\n*Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], (1961);\n*President of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] (1966)\n*Honorary Member of the [[International Statistical Institute]], (1980);\n*Foreign Associate of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], (1993);\n*[[D.Sc.]]s from the [[University of Chicago]] (1966) and the [[University of Hull]] (1976).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Works==\n\n===Some papers===\n* (1933) with [[John Wishart (statistician)|John Wishart]], The distribution of second order moment statistics in a normal system.
