Wenninger''' [[Order of Saint Benedict|OSB]] (born [[Park Falls, Wisconsin]],  October 31, 1919)<ref name=Banchoff>Banchoff (2002)</ref> is a mathematician who works on constructing [[polyhedron model]]s, and wrote the first book on their construction.<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn to [[German people|German]] immigrants in Park Falls, Wisconsin, Joseph Wenninger always knew he was going to be a priest.  From an early age, it was understood that his brother Heinie would take after their father and become a baker, and that Joe, as he was then known, would go into the priesthood.<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\nWhen Wenninger was thirteen, after graduating from the parochial school in Park Falls, Wisconsin, his parents saw an advertisement in the German newspaper ''Der Wanderer'' that would help to shape the rest of his life.  The ad was for a preparatory school in [[Collegeville, Minnesota]], associated with the Benedictine [[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University|St. John’s University]].<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\nWhile admitting to feeling homesick at first, Wenninger quickly made friends and, after a year, knew that this was where he needed to be.  He was a student in a section of the prep school that functioned as a “minor seminary” – later moving on into St. John’s where he studied philosophy and theology, which led into the priesthood.<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\n==Career==\nWhen Fr. Wenninger became a [[Benedictine monk]], he took on his monastic name Magnus, meaning “Great”.  At the start of his career, Wenninger did not set out on a path one might expect would lead to his becoming the great polyhedronist that he is known as today. Rather, a few chance happenings and seemingly minor decisions shaped a course for Wenninger that led to his groundbreaking studies.<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\nShortly after becoming a priest, Wenninger’s Abbot informed him that their order was starting up a school in the Bahamas.  It was decided that Wenninger would be assigned to teach at that school.  In order to do this, it was necessary that he get a master's degree. Wenninger was sent to the [[University of Ottawa]], in Canada, to study educational psychology. There he studied symbolic logic under Thomas Greenwood of the philosophy department. His thesis title was “The Concept of Number According to Roger Bacon and Albert the Great”.<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\nAfter completing his degree, Wenninger went to the school in the Bahamas, where he was asked by the headmaster to choose between teaching English or math. Wenninger chose math, since it seemed to be more in line with the topic of his MA thesis. However, not having taken many math courses in college, Wenninger admits to being able to teach by staying a few pages ahead of the students. He taught Algebra, Euclidean Geometry, Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry.<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\nAfter ten years of teaching, Wenninger felt he was becoming a bit stale.  At the suggestion of his headmaster, Wenninger attended the Columbia Teachers College in summer sessions over a four-year period in the late fifties. It was here that his interest in the “New Math” was formed and his studies of the polyhedra began.<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\n==Publications==\nWenninger’s first publication on the topic of polyhedra was the booklet entitled, “Polyhedron Models for the Classroom”, which he wrote in 1966. He wrote to [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] and received a copy of ''Uniform polyhedra ''which had a complete list of all 75 [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]].'' ''After this, he spent a great deal of time building various polyhedra. He made 65 of them and had them on display in his classroom. At this point, Wenninger decided to contact a publisher to see if there was any interest in a book. He had the models photographed and wrote the accompanying text, which he sent of to [[Cambridge University Press]] in London. The publishers indicated an interest in the book only if Wenninger built all 75 of the [[List of uniform polyhedra|uniform polyhedra]].<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\nWenninger did complete the models, with the help of R. Buckley of [[Oxford University]] who had done the calculations for the [[Snub (geometry)|snub]] forms by computer. This allowed Wenninger to build these difficult polyhedra with the exact measurements for lengths of the edges and shapes of the faces. This was the first time that all of the uniform polyhedra had been made as paper models. This project took Wenninger nearly ten years, and the book, ''Polyhedron Models'', was published by the Cambridge University Press in 1971, largely due to the exceptional photographs taken locally in Nassau.<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\nFrom 1971 onward, Wenninger focused his attention on the projection of the uniform polyhedra onto the surface of their circumscribing spheres. This led to the publication of his second book, ''Spherical Models'' in 1979, showing how regular, or semiregular, polyhedron can be used to build [[geodesic dome]]s. He also exchanged ideas with other mathematicians, [[Hugo Verheyen]] and [[Gilbert Fleurent]].<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\nIn 1981, Wenninger left the Bahamas and returned to St. John’s Abbey. His third book, ''Dual Models'', appeared in 1983. The book is a sequel to ''Polyhedron Models'', since it includes instructions on how to make paper models of the [[Dual polyhedron|duals]] of all 75 uniform polyhedra.<ref name=Banchoff></ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Wenninger polyhedron models]]\n\n==issue 02==\n*{{citation|url=http://lab-zine.com/media/pdf/articles/father_magnus.pdf|first=Thomas |last=Banchoff |title=Father Magnus and his polyhedrons }}, LAB Issue 02, June 2008\n*{{citation|last=Friedman|first= Nat.|title=Magnus Wenninger: Mathematical Models|url=http://www.isama.org/hyperseeing/07/07-11.pdf|journal=Hyperseeing|year= 2007}}\n\n==Publications==\n*{{Citation | last1=Wenninger | first1=Magnus | author1-link=Magnus Wenninger | title=Polyhedron Models | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-09859-5 |mr=0467493 | year=1974}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Wenninger | first1=Magnus | author1-link=Magnus Wenninger | title=Spherical Models | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-29432-4 |mr=552023 | year=1979|url=http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/mwenninger/magnus2000.html }} {{dead link|date=May 2010}} Reprinted by Dover 1999 ISBN 978-0-486-40921-4\n*{{Citation | last1=Wenninger | first1=Magnus | author1-link=Magnus Wenninger | title=Dual Models | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-54325-5 |mr=730208 | year=1983}}\n\nComplete publications (Arranged chronologically):\n*1963-69\n**''Stellated Rhombic Dodecahedron Puzzle'' The Mathematics Teacher (March 1963).\n**''The World of Polyhedrons'' The Mathematics Teacher (March 1965).\n**''Some Facts About Uniform Polyhedrons.''
