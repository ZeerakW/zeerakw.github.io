(\"Major\" was his forename, not a military rank.) He was educated on the classical side at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] and went on to study medicine at [[University College London]] and the [[London Hospital]]. On qualifying in 1904 he worked for a time as assistant to his father but after a few months he gave up [[clinical practice]] for good.\n\nHe went to work as a demonstrator for the physiologist [[Leonard Erskine Hill|Leonard Hill]] (father of the future statistician [[Austin Bradford Hill]]) at the [[London Hospital Medical College]]. Leonard Hill recalled, \"By recognising the ability of a student with nothing behind him to show his worth and by appointing him my assistant I may claim to have started Greenwood on his career.\" While Greenwood made a good start in physiological research he was already drawn to statistics; his first paper in [[Biometrika]] appeared in 1904. After a period of study with [[Karl Pearson]] he was appointed statistician to the [[Lister Institute]] in 1910. There he worked on a wide range of problems, including a study of the effectiveness of [[inoculation]] with the statistician [[Udny Yule]]. In the [[World War I|First World War]] Greenwood first served in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] but then was put in charge of a medical research unit at the [[Ministry of Munitions]]. There he investigated the health problems associated with [[factory]] work, one result of which was an influential study of accidents which he produced with Yule. In 1919 Greenwood joined the newly created [[Ministry of Health (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Health]] with responsibility for medical statistics. In 1928 he became the first professor of [[Epidemiology]] and [[vital statistics (government records)|Vital Statistics]] at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] where he stayed until he retired in 1945. He established a group of researchers, of whom the most important was [[Austin Bradford Hill]]. Greenwood played the same role in A. B. Hill’s career as Hill’s father had played in his.\n\nThe [[Royal Society]] awarded the [[Buchanan Medal]] to Greenwood in 1927,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/General_WF.aspx?pageid=7031| title=Buchanan archive winners 1957 – 1897| publisher=The [[Royal Society]]| accessdate=22 March 2011}}</ref> and elected him a [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellow]] in 1928.<ref name=\"frs\"/> The election certificate stated\n<blockquote>\nEngaged in medical research. Has applied the statistical method to the elucidation of many problems of physiology, pathology, hygiene and epidemiology. Is the author, or joint author, of more than sixty papers dealing with these applications, including important contributions to the experimental study of epidemiology (Journ Hyg, 24, 1925, Greenwood and Topley; ibid, 25, 1926, Greenwood, Newbold, Topley and Wilson). Has done much to encourage and develop the use of modern statistical methods by medical laboratory investigators, and, as Chairman of the Medical Research Council's Statistical Committee, to secure the adequate planning and execution of field investigations.\n</blockquote>\n\nHe was elected [[President of the Royal Statistical Society]] in 1934<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rss.org.uk/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=486|title = Royal Statistical Society Presidents|publisher= Royal Statistical Society|accessdate = 6 August 2010}}</ref> and awarded its [[Guy Medal]] in Gold in 1945.\n\nGreenwood produced a large body of research, was the first holder of important positions in modern [[medical statistics]] and wrote extensively on the history of his subject, but as [[Austin Bradford Hill]] wrote in his obituary, \"in the future, it may well indeed seem that one of his greatest contributions, if not the greatest, lay merely in his outlook, in his statistical approach to medicine, then a new approach and one long regarded with suspicion. And he fought this fight continuously and honestly—for logic for accuracy, for ‘little sums.’\"\n\nHis name is attached to the Greenwood formula for the [[variance]] or [[standard error]] (SE) of the [[Kaplan–Meier estimator]] of survival.<ref>{{cite paper |authorlink=Major Greenwood |last=Greenwood |first=Major |title=The natural duration of cancer |work=Reports on Public Health and Medical Subjects |location=London |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |year=1926 |volume=33 |pages=1–26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=Edward L. |last2=Meier |first2=Paul |title=Nonparametric estimation from incomplete observations |journal=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association|J.
