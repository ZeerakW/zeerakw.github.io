He was born to a [[Polish-Jewish]] family; their town, [[Kremenets]] ([[Polish Language|Polish]]: \"Krzemieniec\"), changed hands from the Russian Empire to Poland when Kac was a child.<ref name=\"rochester\">[http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/rarm/kac.html Obituary] in ''Rochester Democrat & Chronicle'', 11 November 1984</ref> His main interest was [[probability]] theory. His question, \"[[Hearing the shape of a drum|Can one hear the shape of a drum]]?\" set off research into [[spectral theory]], with the idea of understanding the extent to which the spectrum allows one to read back the geometry. (In the end, the answer was \"no\", in general.)\n\nKac completed his Ph.D. in mathematics at the Polish [[University of Lwów]] in 1937 under the direction of [[Hugo Steinhaus]].<ref name=\"mathgen\">{{MathGenealogy|id=17851}}</ref> While there, he was a member of the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]]. After receiving his degree he began to look for a position abroad, and in 1938 was granted a scholarship from the Parnas Foundation which enabled him to go work in the United States. He arrived in New York City in November, 1938.<ref name=\"autobio\">Mark Kac, ''Enigmas of Chance: An Autobiography'', Harper and Row, New York, 1985.

The answer was  positive, meaning that the [[eigenfrequency]] set does not uniquely characterize the shape of a resonator.\n\n==Reminiscences==\n*His definition of a profound truth. \"A truth is a statement whose negation is false. A profound truth is a truth whose negation is also a profound truth.\" (Also attributed to [[Niels Bohr]])\n*He preferred to work on results that were robust, meaning that they were true under many different assumptions and not the accidental consequence of a set of axioms.\n*Often Kac's \"proofs\" consisted of a series of worked examples that illustrated the important cases.\n*When Kac and [[Richard Feynman]] were both on the Cornell faculty he went to a lecture of Feynman's and saw that the two of them were working on the same thing from different directions. The [[Feynman-Kac formula]] resulted, which proves rigorously the real case of Feynman's path integrals. The complex case, which occurs when a particle's spin is included, is still unproven. Kac had learned [[Wiener process]]es by reading [[Norbert Wiener]]'s original papers, which were \"the most difficult papers I have ever read.\"<ref name=autobio/> [[Brownian motion]] is a [[Wiener process]]. [[Feynman's path integral]]s are another example.\n*Kac's distinction between an \"ordinary genius\" like [[Hans Bethe]] and a \"magician\" like [[Richard Feynman]] has been widely quoted. (Bethe was also at Cornell University.)\n*Kac became interested in the occurrence of statistical independence without randomness. As an example of this, he gave a lecture on the average number of factors that a random integer has. This wasn't really random in the strictest sense of the word, because it refers to the average number of prime divisors of the integers up to ''N'' as ''N'' goes to infinity, which is predetermined. He could see that the answer was ''c log log N'', if you assumed that the number of prime divisors of two numbers x and y were independent, but he was unable to provide a complete proof of independence. [[Paul Erdős]] was in the audience and soon finished the proof using [[Sieve theory]], and the result became known as the [[Erdős–Kac theorem]]. They continued working together and more or less created the subject of  [[Probabilistic number theory]].\n*Kac sent Erdős a list of his publications, and one of his papers contained the word [[Capacitor]] in the title. Erdős wrote back to him \"I pray for your soul.\"\n*Kac got a typed manuscript back from his secretary and it contained the following sentence \"This result can be verified by connecting 300 volts across a negro gentleman.\" He looked at his handwritten draft to see what could possibly have produced this, and it said \"This result can be verified by connecting 300 volts across a rigger,\" which was a [[Breadboard]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\n* 1950 — [[Chauvenet Prize]] for 1947 expository article<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kac, Mark|title=Random walk and the theory of Brownian motion|journal=Amer.
