She is the author of books and papers in the fields of [[mathematics]], [[mathematics education]], [[computer science]], [[applied statistics]], economic equity, [[discrimination law]], and [[academic freedom]]. She is currently on the Board of Advisers for POMED (Project on Middle East Democracy) <ref>{{Cite web|title = Board of Advisers|url = http://pomed.org/about-us/board-of-advisors/|website = Project on Middle East Democracy (POMED)|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}</ref> and is the Chair of the Board of Directors of AMIDEAST (America-Mideast Educational and Training Services, Inc.).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Board of Directors|url = http://www.amideast.org/about/board-directors|website = AMIDEAST|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}</ref>\n\n== Biography and career ==\nGray completed her undergraduate degree from [[Hastings College]] and her Ph.D. in mathematics from the [[University of Kansas]]. She also completed her J.D. from [[Washington College of Law]]. She is a member of the District of Columbia and U.S. Supreme Court bars.\n\nGray was one of the founding members of the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] (AWM) and the first President of the AWM from 1971 to 1973. As reported in \"A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics: The Presidents' Perspectives\", by [[Lenore Blum]], \"As Judy Green remembers (and [[Chandler Davis]], early AWM friend, concurs): 'The formal idea of women getting together and forming a caucus was first made publicly at a MAG [Mathematics Action Group] meeting in 1971 ... in Atlantic City. Joanne Darken, then an instructor at Temple University and now at the Community College of Philadelphia, stood up at the meeting and suggested that the women present remain and form a caucus. I have been able to document six women who remained: me (I was a graduate student at Maryland at the time), Joanne Darken, Mary [W.] Gray (she was already at American University), Diane Laison (then an instructor at Temple), Gloria Olive (a Senior Lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand who was visiting the U.S. at the time) and Annie Selden...It's not absolutely clear what happened next, except that I've personally always thought that Mary was responsible for getting the whole thing organized ....'\".<ref name = \"awm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.awm-math.org/articles/notices/199107/blum/node2.html#SECTION02010000000000000000 |title=A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics (from Notices): How it was |publisher=Awm-math.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-28}}</ref> Mary W. Gray was the early organizer, placing an advertisement in the February 1971 Notices of the [[American Mathematical Society|AMS]], and writing the first issue of the AWM Newsletter that May. Again as reported by [[Lenore Blum]], \"What I remember hearing about Mary [W.] Gray and the Atlantic City Meetings, indeed what perked my curiosity, was an entirely different event, one that was also to alter dramatically the character of the mathematics community. In those years the AMS was governed by what could only be called an \"old boys network,\" closed to all but those in the inner circle. Mary challenged that by sitting in on the Council meeting in Atlantic City. When she was told she had to leave, she refused saying she would wait until the police came. (Mary relates the story somewhat differently: When she was told she had to leave, she responded she could find no rules in the by-laws restricting attendance at Council meetings. She was then told it was by \"gentlemen's agreement.\" Naturally Mary replied \"Well, obviously I'm no gentleman.\") After that time, Council meetings were open to observers and the process of democratization of the Society had begun.\"<ref name = \"awm\" /> \"A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics: The Presidents' Perspectives\" dedicates a chapter to Mary W. Gray titled \"Mary Gray (1971-1973): The mother of us all\".<ref name = \"awm\" />\n\nGray has received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Mentoring from President [[George W. Bush]]. She has also received honorary degrees from the [[University of Nebraska]] and Hastings College. In 2012 she became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-19.</ref>\n\n==Published works==\n\n===Books===\n* {{cite book | last = Gray | first = Mary W. | title = Radical approach to algebra | publisher = Addison-Wesley Pub.
