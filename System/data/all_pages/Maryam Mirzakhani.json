She went to the United States for graduate work, earning a PhD from [[Harvard University]] (2004), where she worked under the supervision of the Fields Medalist [[Curtis McMullen]].

In her early work, Mirzakhani discovered a formula expressing the volume of a [[moduli space]] with a given genus as a polynomial in the number of boundary components. This led her to obtain a new proof for the formula discovered by [[Edward Witten]] and [[Maxim Kontsevich]] on the intersection numbers of tautological classes on moduli space,<ref name=\"Weil-Petersson\"/> as well as an asymptotic formula for the growth of the number of simple [[closed geodesic]]s on a compact hyperbolic surface, generalizing the [[theorem of the three geodesics]] for spherical surfaces.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mirzakhani|first1=Maryam |title=Growth of the number of simple closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces|journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]]|year=2008 |doi=10.4007/annals.2008.168.97|volume=168|issue=1|pages=97–125|mr=2415399|zbl=1177.37036}}</ref> Her subsequent work has focused on Teichmüller dynamics of moduli space. In particular, she was able to prove the long-standing conjecture that [[William Thurston]]'s [[Earthquake map|earthquake]] flow on [[Teichmüller space]] is ergodic.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mirzakhani|first1=M.|title=Ergodic Theory of the Earthquake Flow|journal=[[International Mathematics Research Notices]]|year=2008|volume=2008|doi=10.1093/imrn/rnm116|mr=2416997}}</ref>\n\nMost recently as of 2014, with [[Alex Eskin]] and with input from Amir Mohammadi, Mirzakhani proved that complex geodesics and their closures in moduli space are surprisingly regular, rather than irregular or fractal.<ref>{{cite journal | first1=Alex | last1=Eskin | first2=Maryam | last2=Mirzakhani | first3=Amir | last3=Mohammadi | title=Isolation, equidistribution, and orbit closures for the SL(2,R) action on moduli space | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume=182 | issue=2 | pages=673-721 | doi=10.4007/annals.2015.182.2.7 | year=2015}}</ref><ref name=IMU-pressrelease /> The closures of complex geodesics are algebraic objects defined in terms of polynomials and therefore they have certain rigidity properties, which is analogous to a celebrated result that [[Marina Ratner]] arrived at during the 1990s.<ref name=IMU-pressrelease /> The [[International Mathematical Union]] said in its press release that, \"It is astounding to find that the rigidity in homogeneous spaces has an echo in the inhomogeneous world of moduli space.\"<ref name=IMU-pressrelease>{{cite press release|title=The Work of Maryam Mirzakhani|publisher=International Mathematics Union|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/2014/news_release_mirzakhani.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nMirzakhani was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014 for \"her outstanding contributions to the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and geometry of [[Riemann surface]]s and their moduli spaces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/general/prizes/2014/prize-citations|publisher=International Mathematical Union|title=IMU Prizes 2014 citations| accessdate = 12 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the award, [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]] professor [[Jordan Ellenberg]] explained her research to a popular audience:\n{{quote|... [Her] work expertly blends dynamics with geometry. Among other things, she studies billiards. But now, in a move very characteristic of modern mathematics, it gets kind of meta: She considers not just one billiard table, but the universe of all ''possible'' billiard tables. And the kind of dynamics she studies doesn't directly concern the motion of the billiards on the table, but instead a transformation of the billiard table itself, which is changing its shape in a rule-governed way; if you like, the table itself moves like a strange planet around the universe of all possible tables ... This isn't the kind of thing you do to win at pool, but it's the kind of thing you do to win a Fields Medal. And it's what you need to do in order to expose the dynamics at the heart of geometry; for there's no question that they're there.<ref name=\"Slate Fields article\">{{cite news|last=Ellenberg|first=Jordan|authorlink=Jordan Ellenberg|title=Math Is Getting Dynamic|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/do_the_math/2014/08/maryam_mirzakhani_fields_medal_first_woman_to_win_math_s_biggest_prize_works.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=13 August 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nPresident [[Hassan Rouhani]] of Iran congratulated her.<ref>{{cite web|title=President hails Prof Mirzakhani, winner of topmost world math prize|url=http://president.ir/en/79887|website=Official Site of the President of The Islamic Republic of Iran|accessdate=19 August 2014|date=13 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nShe is married to Jan Vondrák, a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Theoretical computer science|theoretical computer scientist]] who works at [[IBM Almaden Research Center]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jan Vondrák|url=http://theory.stanford.edu/~jvondrak/data/cv.pdf|website=Stanford University|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-jvondrak Jan Vondrak profile], ibm.com.
