The [[Kendall's tau|Kendall tau rank correlation]] is named after him.\n\n==Education and early life==\nMaurice Kendall was born in [[Kettering]], Northamptonshire as the only child of John Roughton Kendall and Georgina Brewer. As a young child he survived a case of [[meningitis|cerebral meningitis]], which was frequently fatal at that time. After growing up in [[Derby, England|Derby]], England, he studied mathematics at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he played [[cricket]] and [[chess]] (with future champions [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander]] and [[Jacob Bronowski]]). After graduation as a Mathematics [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] in 1929, he joined the [[British Civil Service]] in the [[Ministry of Agriculture]]. In this position he became increasingly interested in using statistics towards agricultural questions, and one of his first published papers to the [[Royal Statistical Society]] involved studying crop productivity using [[factor analysis]]. He was elected a Fellow of the Society in 1934.<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Kendall_Maurice |title=Maurice George Kendall}} Retrieved 26 May 2011</ref>\n\n==Work in statistics==\nIn 1938 and 1939 he began work, along with [[Bernard Babington-Smith]], on the question of [[random number generation]], developing both one of the first early mechanical devices to produce random digits, and formulated a series of tests for [[statistical randomness]] in a given set of digits which, with some small modifications, became fairly widely used.<ref>{{cite journal\n |first1=M.G. |last=Kendall\n |first2=B. |last2=Babington Smith\n |title=Randomness and Random Sampling Numbers\n |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]\n |volume=101 |issue=1 |year=1938 |pages=147–166\n |doi=10.2307/2980655\n |publisher=Blackwell Publishing\n |jstor=2980655\n}}</ref> He produced one of the second large collections of random digits<ref>{{cite book\n |first1=M.G. |last=Kendall\n |first2=B. |last2=Babington Smith\n |title=Tables of Random Sampling Numbers\n |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n |year=1939\n |oclc=2835198\n}}</ref> (100,000 in total, over twice as many as those published by [[L. H. C. Tippett]] in 1927), which was a commonly used tract until the publication of [[RAND Corporation]]'s ''[[A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates]]'' in 1955 (which was developed with a [[roulette]] wheel-like machine very similar to Kendall's and verified as \"random\" using his statistical tests).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1937, he aided the ageing statistician [[G. Udny Yule]] in the revision of his standard statistical textbook, ''Introduction to the Theory of Statistics'', commonly{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} known for many years as \"Yule and Kendall\". The two had met by chance in 1935, and were on close terms until Yule's death in 1951 (Yule was [[godparent|godfather]] to Kendall's second son).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nDuring this period he also began work on the [[Rank correlation|rank correlation coefficient]] which currently bears his name ([[Kendall's tau]]), which eventually led to a monograph on ''Rank Correlation'' in 1948.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the late 1930s, he was additionally part of a group of five other statisticians who endeavoured to produce a reference work summarising recent developments in statistical theory, but it was cancelled on account of onset of [[World War II]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\n==War-time efforts==\nKendall became Assistant general manager to the [[British Chamber of Shipping]] by day and had air-raid warden duties by night. Despite these constraints on his time, he managed to produce volume one of ''The Advanced Theory of Statistics'' in 1943 and a second volume in 1946.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nDuring the war he also produced a series of papers extending to work of [[R.A. Fisher]] on the theory of [[k-statistics]], and developed a number of extensions to this work through the 1950s. After the war, he worked on the theory and practice of [[time series analysis]], and conclusively demonstrated (with the meager [[computing]] resources available at the time) that unsmoothed sample [[periodogram]]s were unreliable estimators for the population spectrum.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==London School of Economics==\nIn 1949 he accepted the second chair of statistics at the [[London School of Economics]], [[University of London]]. Here he worked part-time as the director of the new Research Techniques Division. From 1952 to 1957 he edited a two-volume work on ''Statistical Sources in the United Kingdom'', which was a standard reference until the mid-1970s. In the fifities he also worked on [[multivariate analysis]], and developed the text ''Multivariate Analysis'' in 1957. In the same year he also developed, along with [[W. R. Buckland]], a ''Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', aimed at helping making the tools of statistics more available to potential users in industry and government.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1953 he published \" The Analytics of Economic Time Series, Part 1: Prices\"<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=The Analysis of Economic Time-Series-Part I: Prices\n|last=Kendall\n|first=M. G.\n|journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A]]\n|volume=116\n|year=1953\n|pages=11–34\n|doi=10.2307/2980947\n|issue=1\n|url=http://jstor.org/stable/2980947\n|author2=Bradford Hill, A\n|publisher=Blackwell Publishing\n|jstor=2980947\n}}</ref> in which he suggested that the movement of shares on the stock market was random i.e. they were as likely to go up on a certain day as they were to go down. These results were disturbing to some financial economists and further debate and research then followed. This ultimately led to the creation of the [[Random Walk Hypothesis]], and the closely related [[efficient-market hypothesis]] which states that random price movements indicate a well-functioning or efficient market.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==CEIR and WFS==\nIn 1961 he left the University of London and took a position as the managing director (later chairman) of a consulting company, CEIR (later known as [[Scientific Control Systems]]), and in the same year began a two-year term as president of the [[Royal Statistical Society]]. In the 1960s he published and co-edited a number of volumes and monographs in statistical theory.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1972, he became director of the [[World Fertility Survey]], a project sponsored by the [[International Statistical Institute]] and the United Nations which aimed to study [[fertility]] in developed and developing nations. He continued this work until 1980, when illness forced him to retire.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Honours==\nHe was knighted by the British government in 1974 for his services to the theory of statistics, and received a medal from the United Nations in 1980 in recognition for his work on the World Fertility Survey. He was also elected a fellow of the [[British Academy]] and received the highest honour of the [[Royal Statistical Society]], the [[Guy Medal]] in Gold. He additionally had served as president of the [[Operational Research Society]], the [[Institute of Statisticians]], and was elected a fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]], the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]], the [[Econometric Society]], and the [[British Computer Society]]. At the time of his death in 1983, he was honorary president of the International Statistical Institute.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Family==\nKendall's first wife, Sheila (née Lester), predeceased him. He was survived by their daughter and two sons, and by his second wife, Ruth (née Whitfield) and their son.\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal\n |first=Keith |last=Ord\n |title=In Memoriam: Maurice George Kendall, 1907–1983\n |journal=[[The American Statistician]]\n |volume=38 |issue=1 |year=1984 |pages=36–37\n |jstor=2683557 |doi=10.1080/00031305.1984.10482870\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n |first=Alan |last=Stuart\n |title=Sir Maurice Kendall, 1907–1983\n |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A]]\n |volume=147 |issue=1 |year=1984 |pages=120–122\n |jstor=2981762\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n |first=D.
