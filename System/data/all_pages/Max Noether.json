He has been called \"one of the finest mathematicians of the nineteenth century\".<ref>Lederman, p. 69.</ref> He was the father of [[Emmy Noether]].\n\n==Biography==\nMax Noether was born in [[Mannheim]] in 1844, to a [[Jewish family]] of wealthy wholesale hardware dealers. His grandfather, Elias Samuel, had started the business in [[Bruchsal]] in 1797. In 1809 the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] established a \"Tolerance Edict\", which assigned a hereditary surname to the male head of every Jewish family which did not already possess one. Thus the Samuels became the Noether family, and as part of this Christianization of names, their son Hertz (Max's father) became Hermann. Max was the third of five children Hermann had with his wife Amalia Würzburger.<ref>Dick, pp. 4–7.</ref>\n\nAt 14, Max contracted [[polio]] and was afflicted by its effects for the rest of his life. Through [[autodidacticism|self-study]], he learned advanced mathematics and entered the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1865. He served on the faculty there for several years, then moved to the [[University of Erlangen]] in 1888. While there, he helped to found the field of [[algebraic geometry]].<ref name=\"Led6971\">Lederman, pp. 69–71.</ref>\n\nIn 1880 he married Ida Amalia Kaufmann, the daughter of another wealthy Jewish merchant family. Two years later they had their first child, named Amalia (\"Emmy\") after her mother. [[Emmy Noether]] went on to become a central figure in [[abstract algebra]]. In 1883 they had a son named Alfred, who later studied [[chemistry]] before dying in 1918. Their third child, Fritz, was born in 1884. Like Emmy, [[Fritz Noether]] also found prominence as a mathematician. Little is known about their fourth child, Gustav Robert, born in 1889. He suffered from continual illness and died in 1928.<ref>Dick, pp. 9–45.</ref>\n\nMax Noether served as an ''Ordinarius'' (full professor) at Erlangen for many years, and died there on 13 December 1921.\n\n==Work on algebraic geometry==\n\n[[Alexander von Brill|Brill]] and Max Noether reproved much of [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]'s work on [[Riemann surface]]s by algebraic methods. [[Brill-Noether theory]] went further by estimating the dimension of the space of maps of given degree ''d'' from an [[algebraic curve]] to [[projective space]] '''P'''<sup>''n''</sup>. In [[birational geometry]], Noether introduced the fundamental technique of [[blowing up]] in order to prove [[resolution of singularities]] for plane curves.\n\nMax Noether made major contributions to the theory of [[algebraic surface]]s. [[Noether's formula]] is the first case of the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces. The [[Noether inequality]] is one of the main restrictions on the possible discrete invariants of a surface. The Noether-Lefschetz theorem (proved by [[Solomon Lefschetz|Lefschetz]]) says that the [[Picard group]] of a very general surface of degree at least 4 in '''P'''<sup>3</sup> is generated by the restriction of the [[line bundle]] ''O''(1).\n\nMax Noether and [[Guido Castelnuovo|Castelnuovo]] showed that the [[Cremona group]] of birational automorphisms of the complex projective plane is generated by the \"quadratic transformation\"\n\n: [''x'',''y'',''z''] ↦ [1/''x'', 1/''y'', 1/''z'']\n\ntogether with the group ''PGL''(3,'''C''') of automorphisms of '''P'''<sup>2</sup>. Even today, no explicit generators are known for the group of birational automorphisms of '''P'''<sup>3</sup>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Noether's theorem on rationality for surfaces]]\n*[[Max Noether's theorem (disambiguation)|Max Noether's theorem]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Dick, Auguste.
