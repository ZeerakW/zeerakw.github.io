He published this paper when he was a doctoral student at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. His doctorate (1906) was on 'The Economic Theory of Railroad Rates' and made no reference to perhaps his most famous paper. \n\nHe was active in both publishing and teaching and was at various times employed by the U.S. [[Census Bureau]], the U.S. [[Bureau of Railway Economics]], the U.S. [[Bureau of Statistics]] and the U.S. [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].\n\nHe was married to his wife Nellie, and he fathered 3 sons: Fred, Roger, and Julian Lorenz.\n\nThe term ''[[Lorenz curve]]'' seems first to have been used in 1912 in a textbook ''The Elements of Statistical Method.''\n\n==References==\n* Lorenz, M.
