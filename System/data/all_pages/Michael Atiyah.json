(Adams and Grant-Walker later showed that the bound found by Atiyah and Todd was best possible.) Atiyah and Hirzebruch<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc=papers 30,31}}</ref> used K-theory to explain some relations between [[Steenrod operation]]s and [[Todd class]]es that Hirzebruch had noticed a few years before.

Although soon the result could be extended to ''all'' compact Lie groups by incorporating results from [[Graeme Segal]]'s thesis,<ref>{{harvnb|Segal|1968}}</ref> that extension was complicated. However a simpler and more general proof was produced by introducing [[equivariant K-theory]], ''i.e.'' equivalence classes of ''G''-vector bundles over a compact ''G''-space ''X''.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|Segal|1969}}</ref> It was shown that under suitable conditions the completion of the equivariant K-theory of ''X'' is isomorphic to the ordinary K-theory of a space, <math>X_G</math>, which fibred over ''BG'' with fibre ''X'':\n:<math>K_G(X)^{\\wedge} \\cong K(X_G). </math>\n\nThe original result then followed as a corollary by taking ''X'' to be a point: the left hand side reduced to the completion of ''R(G)'' and the right to ''K(BG)''. See [[Atiyah–Segal completion theorem]] for more details.\n\nHe defined new generalized homology and cohomology theories called bordism and [[cobordism]], and pointed out that many of the deep results on cobordism of manifolds found by [[R.

There are many hard and fundamental problems in mathematics that can easily be reduced to the problem of finding the number of independent solutions of some differential operator, so if one has some means of finding the index of a differential operator these problems can often be solved. This is what the Atiyah–Singer index theorem does: it gives a formula for the index of certain differential operators, in terms of topological invariants that look quite complicated but are in practice usually straightforward to calculate.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nSeveral deep theorems, such as the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], are special cases of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. In fact the index theorem gave a more powerful result, because its proof applied to all compact complex manifolds, while Hirzebruch's proof only worked for projective manifolds. There were also many new applications: a typical one is calculating the dimensions of the moduli spaces of instantons. The index theorem can also be run \"in reverse\": the index is obviously an integer, so the formula for it must also give an integer, which sometimes gives subtle integrality conditions on invariants of manifolds. A typical example of this is [[Rochlin's theorem]], which follows from the index theorem.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n{{quote box\n|align=left\n|width=33%\n|quote=The most useful piece of advice I would give to a mathematics student is always to suspect an impressive sounding Theorem if it does not have a special case which is ''both'' simple ''and'' non-trivial.\n|source=Michael Atiyah<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc = paper 17, p. 76}}</ref>\n}}\nThe index problem for [[elliptic differential operator]]s was posed in 1959 by [[Israil Gelfand|Gel'fand]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gel'fand|1960}}</ref> He noticed the homotopy invariance of the index, and asked for a formula for it by means of [[topological invariant]]s.

[[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch]] and [[Armand Borel|Borel]] had proved the integrality of the [[Â genus]] of a spin manifold, and Atiyah suggested that this integrality could be explained if it were the index of the [[Dirac operator]] (which was rediscovered by Atiyah and Singer in 1961).\n\nThe first announcement of the Atiyah–Singer theorem was their 1963 paper.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|Singer|1963}}</ref> The proof sketched in this announcement was inspired by Hirzebruch's proof of the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] and was never published by them, though it is described in the book by Palais.<ref>{{harvnb|Palais|1965}}</ref> Their first published proof <ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|Singer|1968a}}</ref> was more similar to Grothendieck's proof of the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]], replacing the [[cobordism]] theory of the first proof with [[K-theory]], and they used this approach to give proofs of various generalizations in a sequence of papers from 1968 to 1971.\n\nInstead of just one elliptic operator, one can consider a family of elliptic operators parameterized by some space ''Y''. In this case the index is an element of the K-theory of ''Y'', rather than an integer.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 67}}</ref> If the operators in the family are real, then the index lies in the real K-theory of ''Y''. This gives a little extra information, as the map from the real K theory of ''Y'' to the complex K theory is not always injective.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 68}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Graeme Segal.jpeg|thumb|right|Atiyah's former student [[Graeme Segal]] (in 1982), who worked with Atiyah on equivariant K-theory]]\nWith Bott, Atiyah found an analogue of the [[Lefschetz fixed-point formula]] for elliptic operators, giving the Lefschetz number of an endomorphism of an [[elliptic complex]] in terms of a sum over the fixed points of the endomorphism.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=papers 61, 62, 63}}</ref> As special cases their formula included the [[Weyl character formula]], and several new results about elliptic curves with complex multiplication, some of which were initially disbelieved by experts.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|p=3}}</ref>\nAtiyah and Segal combined this fixed point theorem with the index theorem as follows.\nIf there is a compact [[group action]] of a group ''G'' on the compact manifold ''X'', commuting with the elliptic operator, then one can replace ordinary K theory in the index theorem with [[equivariant K-theory]].\nFor trivial groups ''G'' this gives the index theorem, and for a finite group ''G'' acting with isolated fixed points it gives the Atiyah–Bott fixed point theorem. In general it gives the index as a sum over fixed point submanifolds of the group ''G''.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 65}}</ref>\n\nAtiyah<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 73}}</ref> solved a problem asked independently by [[Lars Hörmander|Hörmander]] and Gel'fand, about whether complex powers of analytic functions define [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]. Atiyah used [[Heisuke Hironaka|Hironaka]]'s resolution of singularities to answer this affirmatively. An ingenious and elementary solution was found at about the same time by [[J. Bernstein]], and discussed by Atiyah.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc=paper 15}}</ref>\n\nAs an application of the equivariant index theorem, Atiyah and Hirzebruch showed that manifolds with effective circle actions have vanishing [[Â-genus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 74}}</ref> (Lichnerowicz showed that if a manifold has a metric of positive scalar curvature then the Â-genus vanishes.)\n\nWith [[Elmer Rees]], Atiyah studied the problem of the relation between topological and holomorphic vector bundles on projective space. They solved the simplest unknown case, by showing that all rank 2 vector bundles over projective 3-space have a holomorphic structure.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 76}}</ref> [[Geoffrey Horrocks|Horrocks]] had previously found some non-trivial examples of such vector bundles, which were later used by Atiyah in his study of instantons on the 4-sphere.\n\n[[Image:Raoul Bott 1986.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Raoul Bott]], who worked with Atiyah on fixed point formulas and several other topics]]\nAtiyah, Bott and [[Vijay Kumar Patodi|Vijay K. Patodi]]<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|Bott|Patodi|1973}}</ref> gave a new proof of the index theorem using the [[heat equation]].\n\nIf the [[manifold]] is allowed to have boundary, then some restrictions must be put on the domain of the elliptic operator in order to ensure a finite index. These conditions can be local (like demanding that the sections in the domain vanish at the boundary) or more complicated global conditions (like requiring that the sections in the domain solve some differential equation). The local case was worked out by Atiyah and Bott, but they showed that many interesting operators (e.g., the [[signature operator]]) do not admit local boundary conditions. To handle these operators, Atiyah, Patodi and Singer introduced global boundary conditions equivalent to attaching a cylinder to the manifold along the boundary and then restricting the domain to those sections that are square integrable along the cylinder, and also introduced the [[Atiyah–Patodi–Singer eta invariant]]. This resulted in a series of papers on spectral asymmetry,<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988d|loc=papers 80–83}}</ref> which were later unexpectedly used in theoretical physics, in particular in Witten's work on anomalies.\n\n[[Image:Schlierenfoto Mach 1-2 Pfeilflügel - NASA.jpg|thumb|left|The lacunas discussed by Petrovsky, Atiyah, Bott and Gårding are similar to the spaces between shockwaves of a supersonic object.]]\nThe fundamental solutions of linear [[hyperbolic partial differential equation]]s often have [[Petrovsky lacuna]]s: regions where they vanish identically. These were studied in 1945 by [[I. G. Petrovsky]], who found topological conditions describing which regions were lacunas.\nIn collaboration with Bott and [[Lars Gårding]], Atiyah wrote three papers updating and generalizing Petrovsky's work.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988d|loc=papers 84, 85, 86}}</ref>\n\nAtiyah<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1976}}</ref> showed how to extend the index theorem to some non-compact manifolds, acted on by a discrete group with compact quotient. The kernel of the elliptic operator is in general infinite-dimensional in this case, but it is possible to get a finite index using the dimension of a module over a [[von Neumann algebra]]; this index is in general real rather than integer valued. This version is called the ''L<sup>2</sup> index theorem,'' and was used by Atiyah and Schmid<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|Schmid|1977}}</ref> to give a geometric construction, using square integrable harmonic spinors, of Harish-Chandra's [[discrete series representation]]s of [[semisimple Lie group]]s. In the course of this work they found a more elementary proof of Harish-Chandra's fundamental theorem on the local integrability of characters of Lie groups.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988d|loc=paper 91}}</ref>\n\nWith H. Donnelly and I. Singer, he extended Hirzebruch's formula (relating the signature defect at cusps of Hilbert modular surfaces to values of L-functions) from real quadratic fields to all totally real fields.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988d|loc=papers 92, 93}}</ref>\n\n===Gauge theory (1977–1985)===\n{{Main|Gauge theory}}\n[[Image:Camposcargas.PNG|thumb|right|On the left, two nearby monopoles of the same polarity repel each other, and on the right two nearby monopoles of opposite polarity form a [[dipole]]. These are abelian monopoles; the non-abelian ones studied by Atiyah are more complicated.]]\nMany of his papers on gauge theory and related topics are reprinted in volume 5 of his collected works.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|year1=1988e}}</ref> A common theme of these papers is the study of moduli spaces of solutions to certain [[non-linear partial differential equation]]s, in particular the equations for instantons and monopoles. This often involves finding a subtle correspondence between solutions of two seemingly quite different equations. An early example of this which Atiyah used repeatedly is the [[Penrose transform]], which can sometimes convert solutions of a non-linear equation over some real manifold into solutions of some linear holomorphic equations over a different complex manifold.\n\nIn a series of papers with several authors, Atiyah classified all instantons on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. It is more convenient to classify instantons on a sphere as this is compact, and this is essentially equivalent to classifying instantons on Euclidean space as this is conformally equivalent to a sphere and the equations for instantons are conformally invariant. With Hitchin and Singer<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=papers 94, 97}}</ref> he calculated the dimension of the moduli space of irreducible self-dual connections (instantons) for any principal bundle over a compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold (the [[Atiyah–Hitchin–Singer theorem]]). For example, the dimension of the space of SU<sub>2</sub> instantons of rank ''k''>0 is 8''k''−3. To do this they used the Atiyah–Singer index theorem to calculate the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space at a point; the tangent space is essentially the space of solutions of an elliptic differential operator, given by the linearization of the non-linear Yang–Mills equations. These moduli spaces were later used by Donaldson to construct his [[Donaldson invariant|invariants of 4-manifolds]].\nAtiyah and Ward used the Penrose correspondence to reduce the classification of all instantons on the 4-sphere to a problem in algebraic geometry.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 95}}</ref> With Hitchin he used ideas of Horrocks to solve this problem, giving the [[ADHM construction]] of all instantons on a sphere; Manin and Drinfeld found the same construction at the same time, leading to a joint paper by all four authors.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 96}}</ref> Atiyah reformulated this construction using [[quaternion]]s and wrote up a leisurely account of this classification of instantons on Euclidean space as a book.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 99}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|align=left\n|width=33%\n|quote=The mathematical problems that have been solved or techniques that have arisen out of physics in the past have been the lifeblood of mathematics.\n|source=Michael Atiyah<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc = paper 19, p. 13}}</ref>\n}}\nAtiyah's work on instanton moduli spaces was used in Donaldson's work on [[Donaldson theory]]. Donaldson showed that the moduli space of (degree 1) instantons over a compact simply connected [[4-manifold]] with positive definite intersection form can be compactified to give a cobordism between the manifold and a sum of copies of complex projective space. He deduced from this that the intersection form must be a sum of one-dimensional ones, which led to several spectacular applications to smooth 4-manifolds, such as the existence of non-equivalent [[smooth structure]]s on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. Donaldson went on to use the other moduli spaces studied by Atiyah to define [[Donaldson invariant]]s, which revolutionized the study of smooth 4-manifolds, and showed that they were more subtle than smooth manifolds in any other dimension, and also quite different from topological 4-manifolds. Atiyah described some of these results in a survey talk.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 112}}</ref>\n\n[[Green's function]]s for linear partial differential equations can often be found by using the [[Fourier transform]] to convert this into an algebraic problem. Atiyah used a non-linear version of this idea.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 101}}</ref> He used the Penrose transform to convert the Green's function for the conformally invariant Laplacian into a complex analytic object, which turned out to be essentially the diagonal embedding of the Penrose twistor space into its square. This allowed him to find an explicit formula for the conformally invariant Green's function on a 4-manifold.\n\nIn his paper with Jones,<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 102}}</ref> he studied the topology of the moduli space of SU(2) instantons over a 4-sphere. They showed that the natural map from this moduli space to the space of all connections induces epimorphisms of [[homology group]]s in a certain range of dimensions, and suggested that it might induce isomorphisms of homology groups in the same range of dimensions. This became known as the [[Atiyah–Jones conjecture]], and was later proved by several mathematicians.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyer|Hurtubise|Mann|Milgram|1993}}</ref>\n\nHarder and [[M. S. Narasimhan]] described the cohomology of the [[moduli space]]s of [[stable vector bundle]]s over [[Riemann surface]]s by counting the number of points of the moduli spaces over finite fields, and then using the Weil conjectures to recover the cohomology over the complex numbers.<ref>{{harvnb|Harder|Narasimhan|1975}}</ref>\nAtiyah and [[R. Bott]] used [[Morse theory]] and the [[Yang–Mills equation]]s over a [[Riemann surface]] to reproduce and extending the results of Harder and Narasimhan.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=papers 104–105}}</ref>\n\nAn old result due to [[Issai Schur|Schur]] and Horn states that the set of possible diagonal vectors of an Hermitian matrix with given eigenvalues is the convex hull of all the permutations of the eigenvalues. Atiyah proved a generalization of this that applies to all compact [[symplectic manifold]]s acted on by a torus, showing that the image of the manifold under the moment map is a convex polyhedron,<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 106}}</ref> and with Pressley gave a related generalization to infinite-dimensional loop groups.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 108}}</ref>\n\nDuistermaat and Heckman found a striking formula, saying that the push-forward of the [[Liouville measure]] of a [[moment map]] for a torus action is given exactly by the stationary phase approximation (which is in general just an asymptotic expansion rather than exact). Atiyah and Bott <ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 109}}</ref> showed that this could be deduced from a more general formula in [[equivariant cohomology]], which was a consequence of well-known [[localization formula for equivariant cohomology|localization theorem]]s. Atiyah showed<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 110}}</ref> that the moment map was closely related to [[geometric invariant theory]], and this idea was later developed much further by his student [[F. Kirwan]]. Witten shortly after applied the [[Duistermaat–Heckman formula]] to loop spaces and showed that this formally gave the Atiyah–Singer index theorem for the Dirac operator; this idea was lectured on by Atiyah.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 124}}</ref>\n\nWith Hitchin he worked on [[magnetic monopole]]s, and studied their scattering using an idea of [[Nick Manton]].<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=papers 115, 116}}</ref> His book <ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|Hitchin|1988}}</ref> with Hitchin gives a detailed description of their work on magnetic monopoles. The main theme of the book is a study of a moduli space of magnetic monopoles; this has a natural Riemannian metric, and a key point is that this metric is complete and [[hyperkähler]]. The metric is then used to study the scattering of two monopoles, using a suggestion of N. Manton that the geodesic flow on the moduli space is the low energy approximation to the scattering. For example, they show that a head-on collision between two monopoles results in 90-degree scattering, with the direction of scattering depending on the relative phases of the two monopoles. He also studied monopoles on hyperbolic space.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 118}}</ref>\n\nAtiyah showed<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 117}}</ref> that instantons in 4 dimensions can be identified with instantons in 2 dimensions, which are much easier to handle. There is of course a catch: in going from 4 to 2 dimensions the structure group of the gauge theory changes from a finite-dimensional group to an infinite-dimensional loop group. This gives another example where the moduli spaces of solutions of two apparently unrelated nonlinear partial differential equations turn out to be essentially the same.\n\nAtiyah and Singer found that anomalies in quantum field theory could be interpreted in terms of index theory of the Dirac operator;<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=papers 119, 120, 121}}</ref> this idea later became widely used by physicists.\n\n===Later work (1986 onwards)===\n[[Image:Edward Witten at Harvard.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Witten]], whose work on invariants of manifolds and [[topological quantum field theories]] was influenced by Atiyah]]\nMany of the papers in the 6th volume<ref>{{harvs|nb|first=Michael|last=Atiyah|year1=2004}}</ref> of his collected works are surveys, obituaries, and general talks.

He introduced the concept of a [[topological quantum field theory]], inspired by Witten's work and Segal's definition of a conformal field theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=paper 132}}</ref> His book<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1990}}</ref> describes the new [[knot invariant]]s found by [[Vaughan Jones]] and [[Edward Witten]] in terms of [[topological quantum field theories]], and his paper with L.

Berry]] (called the [[Berry–Robbins problem]]), who asked if there is a map from the configuration space of ''n'' points in 3-space to the flag manifold of the unitary group. Atiyah gave an affirmative answer to this question, but felt his solution was too computational and studied a conjecture that would give a more natural solution. He also related the question to [[Nahm's equation]], and introduced the [[Atiyah conjecture on configurations]].\n\n{{quote box\n|align=left\n|width=33%\n|quote=But for most practical purposes, you just use the classical groups.
