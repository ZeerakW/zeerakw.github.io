({{Wayback |date=20080129205055 |url=http://stationq.ucsb.edu/index.html |title=Station Q }})</ref> In 1986, he was awarded a [[Fields Medal]] for his work on the [[Poincaré conjecture]]. Freedman and [[Robion Kirby]] showed that an [[exotic R4|exotic '''R'''<sup>4</sup>]] manifold exists.\n\n==Life and career==\nFreedman was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States|U.S.]] His father, [[Benedict Freedman]], was an aeronautical engineer, musician, writer, and mathematician.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-benedict-freedman-20120305,0,6790528.story|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 4, 2012|first=Valerie J.|last=Nelson|title=Benedict Freedman dies at 92; author and Occidental professor}}.</ref> His mother, [[Nancy Freedman|Nancy Mars Freedman]], performed as an actress and also trained as an artist.<ref>{{citation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/22/local/la-me-nancy-freedman-20100822|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 22, 2010|first=Dennis|last=McLellan|title=Nancy Freedman dies at 90; feminist had long and wide-ranging literary career}}.</ref> His parents cowrote a series of novels together. He entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1968, and continued his studies at [[Princeton University]] where he received [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in 1973 for his doctoral dissertation titled ''Codimension-Two Surgery'', written under the supervision of [[William Browder (mathematician)|William Browder]]. After graduating, Freedman was appointed a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He held this post from 1973 until 1975, when he became a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (IAS) at Princeton. In 1976 he was appointed assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD). He spent the year 1980/81 at IAS, returning to UCSD, where in 1982 he was promoted to professor. He was appointed the Charles Lee Powell chair of mathematics at UCSD in 1985.\n\nFreedman has received numerous other awards and honors including [[Sloan Fellowship|Sloan]] and [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s, a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] and the [[National Medal of Science]]. He is an elected member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2012-12-29.</ref> He currently works at [[Microsoft Station Q]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where his team is involved in the development of the [[topological quantum computer]].\n\n==Publications==\n*{{Citation | last1=Freedman | first1=Michael Hartley | title=The topology of four-dimensional manifolds | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214437136 | mr=679066 | year=1982 | journal=Journal of Differential Geometry | issn=0022-040X | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=357–453}}\n\n* Michael H.
