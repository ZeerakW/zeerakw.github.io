JORDAN] Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Department of Statistics, University of California. Accessed September 3, 2013</ref> At the University of California, San Diego Jordan was a student of [[David Rumelhart]] and a member of the PDP Group in the 1980s.\n\nJordan is currently a [[professor|full professor]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where his appointment is split across the Department of Statistics and the Department of EECS. He was a professor at [[MIT]] from 1988-1998.<ref>[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/jordan-vita.pdf Vitae MICHAEL I. JORDAN]</ref>\n\nJordan received numerous awards, including a best student paper award <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~xuanlong/areas.html |title=Long Nguyen's Publications |publisher=Stat.lsa.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref> (with X. Nguyen and M. Wainwright) at the International Conference on Machine Learning ([[ICML]] 2004), a best paper award (with R. Jacobs) at the American Control Conference (ACC 1991), the [[ACM - AAAI Allen Newell Award]], the [[IEEE]] Neural Networks Pioneer Award, and an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] Presidential Young Investigator Award. In 2010 he was named a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] \"for contributions to the theory and application of machine learning.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/2010/fellows-2010 |title=ACM Names 41 Fellows from World's Leading Institutions — Association for Computing Machinery |publisher=Acm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nIt is notable that many of Jordan's graduate students and postdocs continue to strongly influence the machine learning field after their PhDs. Francis Bach, [[Zoubin Ghahramani]], Tommi Jaakkola, [[Andrew Ng]], Lawrence Saul and [[David Blei]] (all former students or postdocs of Jordan) have all continued to make significant contributions to the field.\n\n== Work ==\nIn the 1980s Jordan started developing [[recurrent neural networks]] as a cognitive model. In recent years, though, his work is less driven from a cognitive perspective and more from the background of traditional statistics.\n\nHe popularised [[Bayesian network]]s in the machine learning community and is known for pointing out links between machine learning and [[statistics]]. Jordan was also prominent in the formalisation of [[variational Bayes|variational methods]] for [[approximate inference]]<ref name=\"pnas\">{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Zeliadt | first1 = N. \n| title = Profile of Michael I.

In a public letter, they argued for less restrictive access; a new journal [[Journal of Machine Learning Research]] (JMLR) was created to support the evolution of the field of machine learning.<ref>[http://sigir.org/files/forum/F2001/sigirFall01Letters.html Editorial Board of the Kluwer Journal, Machine Learning: Resignation Letter (2001)]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/ Homepage] (at University of California, Berkeley)\n*[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/publications.html Published papers] (chronological)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata         <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n| NAME              =Jordan, Michael I.\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American artificial intelligence researcher\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = February 25, 1956\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Maryland\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jordan, Michael I.}}\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Artificial intelligence researchers]]\n[[Category:Machine learning researchers]]\n[[Category:University of California, San Diego alumni]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley College of Engineering faculty]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering]]\n[[Category:Rumelhart Prize laureates]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Michael I.
