He passed most of his childhood years in [[Egypt]] and received his primary and secondary education there in French schools. Later, after achieving the grades of B.L. in 1931 and A.B. in 1936, he studied [[mathematics]] at the [[Université de Paris]] under [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]], and received his ''[[Doctor of Science|Docteur ès Sciences]] (Mathématiques)'' in 1941. In 1936 was employed as actuaire of the [[University of Lyon]].\n\nBecause of his Jewish origin, he was arrested during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]] and sent to [[Drancy internment camp]]. One of his books, Loève (1955),<ref name=Loeve:55:book:Probability>{{cite book|last=Loève|first=Michel|title=Probability Theory|year=1955|publisher=D Van Nostrand|location=Princeton, New Jersey, USA|pages=xvi+685}}</ref> is dedicated \"To Line and To the students and teachers of the School in the Camp de Drancy\". Having survived the [[Holocaust]], after the liberation he became between 1944 and 1946 chief of research at the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] at Paris University, then until 1948 worked at the [[University of London]].\n\nAfter one term as a visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] he accepted the position of professor of Mathematics at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], in 1955 adding the title professor of [[Statistics]].\n\nHe is the author of one of the earliest book on measure-theoretic probability theory and one of the best known textbooks.<ref>\"For a long time Loeve's book served as the standard textbook on advanced probability theory\", in Hoffman-Jorgensen, J.
