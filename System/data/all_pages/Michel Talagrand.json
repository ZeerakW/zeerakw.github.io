Docteur ès sciences since 1977, he has been, since 1985, Directeur de Recherches at [[CNRS]] and a member of the  Functional Analysis Team of the Institut de Mathématique of [[Paris]]. Talagrand was elected as correspondent of the [[Académie des sciences]] of Paris on March 1997, and then as a full member on November 2004, in the Mathematics section.\n\nTalagrand studies mainly [[functional analysis]] and [[probability theory]] and their applications.\n\n==Scientific activity==\n\nTalagrand has been interested in probability with minimal structure. He has obtained a complete characterization of bounded Gaussian processes in very general settings, and also new methods\nto bound stochastic processes. He discovered new aspects of the [[isoperimetry|isoperimetric]] and [[concentration of measure]] phenomena for product spaces, by obtaining inequalities which make use of new kind of distances between a point and a subset of a product space. These inequalities show in great generality that a random quantity which depends on many independent variables, without depending too much on one of them, does have only small fluctuations. These inequalites helped to solve most classical problems in probability theory on [[Banach spaces]], and have also transformed the abstract theory of stochastic processes. These inequalites have been successfully used in many applications involving stochastic quantities, like for instance in [[statistical mechanics]] (disordered systems), [[theoretical computer science]], \n[[Random matrix|random matrices]], and [[statistics]] (empirical processes).\nThe recent works of Talagrand concern [[spin glass]]es mean fields models. His objective is to give a mathematical foundation to numerous remarkable works of [[physicists]] in this domain. Talagrand showed for instance recently the validity of the [[Giorgio Parisi|Parisi]] formula.\n\n==Awards==\n\n*[[Peccot-Vimont Prize]] of the French [[Collège de France]] (1980)\n*[[Servant Prize]] of the French [[Académie des sciences]] (1985)\n*Invited Speaker to the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (Kyoto 1990)\n*[[Loève Prize]] in Probability (1995)\n*[[Fermat Prize]] for mathematical research (1997)\n*Corresponding member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] (1997) \n*Plenary Speaker to the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (Berlin 1998)\n*Member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] (2004) \n*Chevalier of the Order of the [[Legion of Honor]] (2011)\n\n==Selected publications==\n\n*''Espaces de Banach faiblement K-analytiques'', Annals of Math. 110 (1979) 407-438\n*''Regularity of Gaussian processes'', Acta Math. 159 (1987) 99-149\n*''Some distributions that allow perfect packing'', (avec W.
