During his time at Rutgers, Friedman became influenced by two economics professors, [[Arthur F. Burns]] and [[Homer Jones (economist)|Homer Jones]], who convinced him that modern economics could help end the [[Great Depression]].\n\nAfter graduating from Rutgers, Friedman was offered two scholarships to do graduate work&nbsp;— one in mathematics at Brown University and the other in economics at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Milton Friedman and his start in economics|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhYOtG2pt3w&feature=related|date=August 2006|publisher=Young America's Foundation|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> Friedman chose the latter, thus earning a [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1933. He was strongly influenced by [[Jacob Viner]], [[Frank Knight]], and [[Henry Calvert Simons|Henry Simons]]. It was at Chicago that Friedman met his future wife, economist [[Rose Friedman|Rose Director]]. During the 1933–1934 academic year he had a [[Fellow#Graduate school fellowships|fellowship]] at [[Columbia University]], where he studied statistics with renowned statistician and economist [[Harold Hotelling]]. He was back in Chicago for the 1934–1935 academic year, working as a research assistant for [[Henry Schultz]], who was then working on ''Theory and Measurement of Demand''. That year, Friedman formed what would prove to be lifelong friendships with [[George Stigler]] and [[W. Allen Wallis]].<ref>Ebenstein, ''Milton Friedman: a biography'' (2007) pp. 13–30</ref>\n\n==Public service==\nFriedman was initially unable to find academic employment, so in 1935 he followed his friend W.

Ideas from this project later became a part of his ''Theory of the Consumption Function''. Friedman began employment with the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] during autumn 1937 to assist [[Simon Kuznets]] in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication ''Incomes from Independent Professional Practice'', which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, a major component of the [[Permanent income hypothesis|Permanent Income Hypothesis]] that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s. The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.\n\nDuring 1940, Friedman was appointed an assistant professor teaching Economics at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], but encountered [[antisemitism]] in the Economics department and decided to return to government service.<ref>{{harvnb|Friedman|1999|p=42}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Friedman|1999|pp=84–85}}</ref> From 1941 to 1943 Friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the Federal Government, as an advisor to senior officials of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].

The university awarded him a PhD in 1946. Friedman spent the 1945–1946 academic year teaching at the [[University of Minnesota]] (where his friend George Stigler was employed). On February 12, 1945, his son, [[David D. Friedman]] was born.\n\n===University of Chicago===\n[[File:Harper Midway Chicago.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[University of Chicago]]]]\nIn 1946, Friedman accepted an offer to teach economic theory at the University of Chicago (a position opened by departure of his former professor [[Jacob Viner]] to Princeton University). Friedman would work for the University of Chicago for the next 30 years. There he contributed to the establishment of an intellectual community that produced a number of Nobel Prize winners, known collectively as the [[Chicago school of economics]].\n\nAt that time, [[Arthur F. Burns]], who was then the head of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], asked Friedman to rejoin the Bureau's staff. He accepted the invitation, and assumed responsibility for the Bureau's inquiry into the role of money in the [[business cycle]]. As a result, he initiated the \"Workshop in Money and Banking\" (the \"Chicago Workshop\"), which promoted a revival of monetary studies. During the latter half of the 1940s, Friedman began a collaboration with Anna Schwartz, an [[Economic history|economic historian]] at the Bureau, that would ultimately result in the 1963 publication of a book co-authored by Friedman and Schwartz, ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960''.\n\nFriedman spent the 1954–1955 academic year as a Fulbright Visiting Fellow at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]. At the time, the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority (including [[Joan Robinson]] and [[Richard Kahn, Baron Kahn|Richard Kahn]]) and an anti-Keynesian minority (headed by [[Dennis Robertson (economist)|Dennis Robertson]]). Friedman speculated that he was invited to the fellowship, because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions. Later his weekly columns for ''Newsweek'' magazine (1966–84) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people.<ref>CATO, \"Letter from Washington,\" ''National Review,'' September 19, 1980, Vol. 32 Issue 19, p. 1119</ref> From 1968 to 1978, he and [[Paul Samuelson]] participated in the Economics Cassette Series, a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days' issues for about a half-hour at a time.<ref>[http://hoohila.stanford.edu/friedman/ecs.php Rose and Milton Friedman<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/samuelsonpaul/ Inventory of the Paul A.

He and his wife moved to San Francisco where he became a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. From 1977 on, he was affiliated with the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]]. During the same year, Friedman was approached by the Free To Choose Network and asked to create a television program presenting his economic and social philosophy.\n\nThe Friedmans worked on this project for the next three years, and during 1980, the ten-part series, titled ''[[Free to Choose]]'', was broadcast by the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS). The companion book to the series (co-authored by Milton and his wife, [[Rose Friedman]]), also titled ''Free To Choose'', was the bestselling nonfiction book of 1980 and has since been translated into 14 foreign languages.\n\nFriedman served as an unofficial adviser to Ronald Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign, and then served on the President's Economic Policy Advisory Board for the rest of the [[Reagan Administration]]. [[Alan O.

[[Monetarism]] is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins can be traced back to the 16th-century [[School of Salamanca#Money, value, and price|School of Salamanca]] or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960'' (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and [[economy of the United States|economic activity]] in the U.S. history. A striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations. Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing, but largely untested, view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level.\n\nFriedman was the main proponent of the [[monetarism|monetarist]] school of economics. He maintained that there is a close and stable association between [[inflation]] and the money supply, mainly that inflation could be avoided with proper regulation of the [[Monetary Base|monetary base's]] growth rate. He famously used the analogy of \"dropping money out of a helicopter.\",<ref>{{cite book |title=Optimum Quantity of Money |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |year=1969 |page=4}}</ref> in order to avoid dealing with money injection mechanisms and other factors that would overcomplicate his models.\n\nFriedman's arguments were designed to counter the popular concept of [[Cost-push inflation]], that the increased [[Price Level|General Price Level]] at the time was the result of increases in the price of oil, or increases in wages; as he wrote, {{quote|Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.|Milton Friedman, 1963.<ref>Friedman, Milton. ''Inflation: Causes and Consequences''. New York: Asia Publishing House.</ref>}}\n\nFriedman rejected the use of [[fiscal policy]] as a tool of [[demand]] management; and he held that the government's role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely. Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression, which he termed the [[Great Contraction]], arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial [[shock (economics)|shock]] whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve.\n{{quote|The Fed was largely responsible for converting what might have been a garden-variety recession, although perhaps a fairly severe one, into a major catastrophe. Instead of using its powers to offset the depression, it presided over a decline in the quantity of money by one-third from 1929 to 1933&nbsp;... Far from the depression being a failure of the free-enterprise system, it was a tragic failure of government.|Milton Friedman|Two Lucky People, 233<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themoneymasters.com/the-money-masters/milton-friedman-end-the-fed/ |title=Milton Friedman: END THE FED |publisher=Themoneymasters.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref>}}\n\nFriedman also argued for the cessation of government intervention in [[Foreign exchange market|currency markets]], thereby spawning an enormous literature on the subject, as well as promoting the practice of freely floating [[exchange rate]]s. His close friend [[George Stigler]] explained, \"As is customary in science, he did not win a full victory, in part because research was directed along different lines by the [[Rational expectations|theory of rational expectations]], a newer approach developed by [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], also at the University of Chicago.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoirs of an Unregulated Economist |first=Milton |last=Friedman |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |year=1969 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nFriedman was also known for his work on the consumption function, the [[permanent income hypothesis]] (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Charlie Rose Show |airdate=December 26, 2005}}</ref> This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the [[Phillips curve]] and the concept of the [[natural rate of unemployment]] (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of [[Edmund Phelps]], with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.\n\nFriedman's essay \"[[Essays in Positive Economics#The Methodology of Positive Economics|The Methodology of Positive Economics]]\" (1953) provided the [[epistemological]] pattern for his own subsequent research and to a degree that of the Chicago School. There he argued that economics as ''science'' should be free of value judgments for it to be objective. Moreover, a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction. That is, students should measure the accuracy of its predictions, rather than the 'soundness of its assumptions'. His argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as [[Jerzy Neyman]], [[Leonard Savage]], and [[Ronald Fisher]].<ref>David Teira, \"Milton Friedman, the Statistical Methodologist,\" ''History of Political Economy'' (2007) 39#3 pp. 511–527,</ref>\n\n===Statistics===\nOne of his most famous contributions to statistics is [[sequential analysis|sequential sampling]]. Friedman did statistical work at the Division of War Research at Columbia, where he and his colleagues came up with the technique. It later became, in the words of ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', \"the standard analysis of quality control inspection\". The dictionary adds, \"Like many of Friedman’s contributions, in retrospect it seems remarkably simple and obvious to apply basic economic ideas to quality control; that however is a measure of his genius.\"<ref name=ReasonOnFriedman>[http://www.reason.com/news/show/118494.html The Life and Times of Milton Friedman – Remembering the 20th century's most influential libertarian]</ref>\n\n==Public policy positions==\n{{Libertarianism sidebar |width=22em}}\n\n===Federal Reserve===\nDue to its poor performance,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fkdagNrjI \"There in no institution in the US that has such a high public standing and such a poor record of performance\" \"It's done more harm than good\"</ref> Friedman believed that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished.<ref>{{YouTube|CMY0tAHHF_M|\"My first preference would be to abolish the Federal Reserve\"}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fkdagNrjI  \"I have long been in favor of abolishing it.\"</ref> He further believed that if the money supply was to be centrally controlled (as by the Federal Reserve System) that the preferable way to do it would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate.\n\n===Exchange rates===\n\nFriedman was a strong advocate for floating exchange rates throughout the entire [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton-Woods]] period. He argued that a flexible exchange rate would make external adjustment possible and allow countries to avoid [[Balance of Payments]] crisis. He saw fixed exchange rates as an undesirable form of government intervention. The case was articulated in an influential 1953 paper, \"The Case for Flexible Exchange Rates\", at a time, when most commentators regarded the possibility of floating exchange rates as a fantasy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=infHAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT72&dq=milton+friedman+floating+exchange+rates&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Rg4oVePsNtC5ogTVkoHwBQ&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=milton%20friedman%20floating%20exchange%20rates&f=false]</ref><ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2014/wp14146.pdf]</ref>\n\n===School choice===\nIn his 1955 article \"The Role of Government in Education\" Friedman proposed supplementing publicly operated schools with privately run but publicly funded schools through a system of [[school voucher]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=795126 |title=Review: Education Vouchers |journal=The Yale Law Journal |volume=80 |issue=2 |date=December 1970 |pages=451–461 |author=Leonard Ross and Richard Zeckhauser |doi=10.2307/795126 |ref=harv}}</ref> Reforms similar to those proposed in the article were implemented in, for example, Chile in 1981 and Sweden in 1992.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=1189163 |title=National Voucher Plans in Chile and Sweden: Did Privatization Reforms Make for Better Education? |author=Martin Carnoy |journal=Comparative Education Review |volume=42 |issue=3 |date=August 1998 |pages=309–337 |doi=10.1086/447510 |ref=harv}}</ref> In 1996, Friedman, together with his wife, founded [[The Foundation for Educational Choice]] to advocate [[school choice]] and vouchers.\n\n===Conscription===\nWhile [[Walter Oi]] is credited with establishing the economic basis for a [[volunteer military]], Milton Friedman was a proponent, stating that the [[Conscription|draft]] was \"inconsistent with a free society.\"<ref>{{Cite AV media | people = Milton Friedman | title = The War on Drugs | publisher = America's Drug Forum |year=1991 | url = http://yes390.org/friedmanvideos.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Rostker |first= Bernard |title= I Want You!: The Evolution of the All-Volunteer Force |publisher= [[Rand Corporation]] |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0-8330-3895-1 |page= 4 }}</ref>\nIn ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', he argued that conscription is inequitable and arbitrary, preventing young men from shaping their lives as they see fit.<ref name=draft>{{cite book |title=Capitalism and Freedom|page=36|first=Milton|last=Friedman|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|date=November 15, 2002}}</ref> During the Nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid/volunteer armed force.

However, he argued that many of the services performed by government could be performed better by the private sector. Above all, if some public goods are provided by the state, he believed that they should not be a [[legal monopoly]] where private competition is prohibited; for example, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|There is no way to justify our present public monopoly of the post office. It may be argued that the carrying of mail is a technical monopoly and that a government monopoly is the least of evils. Along these lines, one could perhaps justify a government post office, but not the present law, which makes it illegal for anybody else to carry the mail. If the delivery of mail is a technical monopoly, no one else will be able to succeed in competition with the government. If it is not, there is no reason why the government should be engaged in it.

Laar's reforms are often credited with responsibility for transforming Estonia from an impoverished Soviet Republic to the \"[[Baltic Tiger]].\" A prime element of Laar's program was introduction of the [[flat tax]]. Laar won the 2006 Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty, awarded by the [[Cato Institute]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/special/friedman/laar/|title=Mart Laar|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nAfter 1950 Friedman was frequently invited to lecture in Britain, and by the 1970s his ideas had gained  widespread attention in conservative circles.  For example, he was a regular speaker at the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a libertarian think tank.  Conservative politician [[Margaret Thatcher]] closely followed IEA programs and ideas, and met Friedman there in 1978.  He also strongly influenced [[Keith Joseph]], who became Thatcher's senior advisor on economic affairs, as well as Alan Walters and Patrick Minford, two other key advisers. Major newspapers, including the ''Daily Telegraph,'' ''The Times,'' and ''The Financial Times'' all promulgated Friedman's monetarist ideas to British decision-makers.  Friedman's ideas strongly influenced Thatcher and her allies when she became Prime Minister in 1979.<ref>{{cite book|author=John F.
