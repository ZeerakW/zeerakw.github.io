She attended [[Hunter College High School]], and received an A.B. in mathematics and statistics from [[Hunter College]] in 1935. She continued graduate studies in economics and statistics at the Department of Agriculture Graduate School and [[American University]].<ref name=ssabio/>\n\nIn 1939 she became a research clerk with the Children's Bureau, working on [[biometric]] studies of child health, growth, and nutrition. In January 1942, as a statistician in the [[New York City]] Department of Health, she worked on a survey of the incidence of, and therapies for, pneumonia. In 1945, Orshansky moved to the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], where she spent the next thirteen years a family economist, director of the Program Statistics Division, and a food economist.\n\nIn 1958, Orshansky joined the [[Social Security Administration]] as a social science research analyst in the Office of Research and Statistics. In this capacity she was responsible for analytical studies to measure income adequacy, family welfare and patterns of family income. In 1963 she developed the official measure of poverty used by the U.S. government (''see'' [[Poverty in the United States]]). She used the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet as the basis for a cost-of-living estimate and to calculate a [[cost of living]] for families of different sizes and composition.<ref>Mollie Orshansky.

She retired in 1982.<ref name=ssabio>[http://www.ssa.gov/history/orshansky.html Mollie Orshansky] Social Security History on ssa.gov</ref>\n\nShe was hospitalized in the autumn of 2001 and a legal battle ensued over her care. Orshansky was taken to New York according to her wishes, but a judge who had appointed a guardian tried to compel her return to Washington DC. The judge was overruled on appeal, and Orshansky died in Manhattan several years later.<ref>Written statement of Jane M.

In the episode \"[[The Indians in the Lobby]],\" the federal government was considering a reclassification of poverty forty years later that would have made use of a new formula to add four million additional citizens to the category.  Orshansky, a native-born U.S. citizen, was characterized incorrectly in the show as an Eastern European immigrant who created a United States \"cost of living formula ... based on life in Poland during the Cold War.\"<ref>Aaron Sorkin.
