A source is needed for both claims.|date=November 2014}} was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[logician]] and [[mathematician]], known for the invention of [[combinatory logic]].\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Schonfinkel.gif|thumb|Moses Schönfinkel]]\nSchönfinkel attended the [[Novorossiysk University]] of [[Odessa]], studying mathematics under [[Samuil Osipovich Shatunovskii]] (1859&ndash;1929), who worked in [[geometry]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]]. From 1914 to 1924, Schönfinkel was a member of [[David Hilbert]]'s group at the [[University of Göttingen]].<ref name=\"CardoneHindley\">{{Citation\n | first1 = Felice | last1 = Cardone\n | authorlink1 = Felice Cardone\n | first2 = J.

By 1927 he was reported to be mentally ill and in a sanatorium.<ref name=\"Archives\"/><ref name=\"Kline\"/> His later life was spent in poverty, and he died in Moscow some time in 1942. His papers were burned by his neighbors for heating.<ref name=\"Kline\"/>\n\n== Work ==\n\nSchönfinkel developed a formal system that avoided the use of [[bound variables]]. His system was essentially equivalent to a combinatory logic based upon the combinators '''B''', '''C''', '''I''', '''K''', and '''S'''. Schönfinkel was able to show that the system could be reduced to just '''K''' and '''S''' and outlined a proof that a version of this system had the same power as [[predicate logic]].<ref name=\"Archives\"/>\n\nHis paper also showed that functions of two or more arguments could be replaced by functions taking a single argument. This replacement mechanism simplifies work in both combinatory logic and [[lambda calculus]] and would later be called [[currying]], after [[Haskell Curry]]. While Curry attributed the concept to Schönfinkel, it had already been used by [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]].<ref>[[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], introduction to ''Bausteine der mathematischen Logik\", pp.&nbsp;305&ndash;316.
