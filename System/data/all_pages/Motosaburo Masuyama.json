Fisher]] and went on to influence the fields of [[quality control]] and [[biometrics]].\n\n==Life==\nBorn [[Otaru, Hokkaidō]], Masuyama graduated in [[physics]] from the [[Imperial University of Tokyo]] in 1937 and earned his [[doctorate]] in 1943. Characterising Fisher's approach to statistics as ''the science of inference and planning'', Masuyama worked across a wide range of agencies including: the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]; the [[University of Tokyo School of Medicine]]; the [[Institute of Statistical Mathematics]]; the [[Indian Statistical Institute]], where he collaborated with Fisher, another frequent visitor; the [[Ministry of Public Health and Welfare]], where his teaching in [[design of experiments]] profoundly influenced the young [[Genichi Taguchi]]; the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], and [[The Catholic University of America]]. In 1970, he joined the applied mathematics department at the University of Tokyo and remained there until his retirement in 1988.\n\nMasuyama held many radical views on the application of statistics to [[human biology]].\n\n==Honours==\n*[[Asahi Prize]], (1948)\n*[[Deming Prize]], (1951)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tibs.org/pdf/news-22-4.pdf Obituary] by Manabu Iwasaki, in ''Biometric'', Bulletin of the ''International Biometric Society'' ([[pdf]])\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Masuyama, Motosaburo\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Japanese statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1912\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 2005\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Masuyama, Motosaburo}}\n[[Category:1912 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:Japanese statisticians]]\n[[Category:Catholic University of America people]]\n[[Category:University of Tokyo faculty]]\n\n\n{{japan-scientist-stub}}\n{{Asia-mathematician-stub}}\n{{Statistician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Motosaburo Masuyama"}}}}
