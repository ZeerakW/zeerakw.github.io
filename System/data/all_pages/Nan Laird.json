(The authors collected a variety of maximum likelihood problems and methods of solving these problems that occurred in the literature. They found that all of these methods had some ideas in common and they named it the EM Algorithm, standing for \"Expectation, Maximization\".)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=80964}}\n*[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/nan-laird/ Nan Laird] at [[Harvard School of Public Health]]\n*[http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?id=4866&cb=13 Nan Laird] at [[ISI Web of Knowledge]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n<!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] -->\n{{Persondata\n|NAME= Laird, Nan M.\n|ALTERNATIVE NAMES=\n|SHORT DESCRIPTION= Mathematician\n|DATE OF BIRTH=September 18, 1943\n|PLACE OF BIRTH=\n|DATE OF DEATH=\n|PLACE OF DEATH=\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Laird, Nan}}\n[[Category:1943 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Women mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Women statisticians]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Harvard University faculty]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:ISI highly cited researchers]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Nan Laird"}}}}
