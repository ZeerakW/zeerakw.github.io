It is designed primarily for two uses: fans interested in [[fantasy baseball]], and professionals in the baseball business trying to predict the performance and [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] of major league players. Unlike most other baseball projection systems, PECOTA relies on matching a given current player to a set of \"comparable\" players whose past performance can serve as a guide to how the given current player is likely to perform in the future. Unlike most other such systems, PECOTA also calculates a range of probable performance levels rather than a single predicted value on a given measure such as [[earned run average]] or [[batting average]].\n\nPECOTA projections were first published by [[Baseball Prospectus]] in the 2003 edition of its annual book as well as online by ''BaseballProspectus.com.''

Silver eventually published detailed forecasts and analyses of the results for all three sets of elections. He correctly predicted the winner in 34 of the 37 contested Senate races.  His 2010 congressional mid-term predictions were not as accurate as those made in 2008, but were still within the reported [[confidence interval]].

Silver takes a big-picture approach to using statistical tools, combining sources of unique data (e.g., timing a minor league ball player's fastball using a radar gun), with historical data and principles of sound statistical analysis; Silver argues that many of these are violated by many pollsters and pundits who nonetheless have important media roles. Case studies in the book include baseball, elections, [[climate change]], the financial crash, poker, and weather forecasting. These different topics illustrate different statistical principles. As a reviewer in ''The New York Times'' notes: \"It’s largely about evaluating predictions in a variety of fields, from finance to weather to epidemiology. We learn about a handful of successes: when, for instance, meteorologists predict a hurricane’s landfall 72 hours in advance.... But mostly we learn about failures. It turns out we’re not even close to predicting the next catastrophic earthquake or the spread of the next killer bird flu, despite the enormous amounts of brainpower trained on these questions in the past few decades\".<ref>Noam Scheiber, \"Known Unknowns: ''The Signal and the Noise,'' by Nate Silver\", ''The New York Times,'' [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/books/review/the-signal-and-the-noise-by-nate-silver.html]</ref>\n\n==Blogs and other publications==\n;Blogs\n* [http://fivethirtyeight.com FiveThirtyEight blog, now owned by ESPN]\n* [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/?author=59 Nate Silver's ''Baseball Prospectus'' article archive] (2003–2009)\n* [http://burritobracket.blogspot.com/ Nate Silver's ''The Burrito Bracket''] (2007)\n* [http://www.dailykos.com/search?story_type=&search_type=search_stories&text_type=any&text_expand=contains&text=&usernames=Poblano&tags=%28tags%29&time_type=time_published&time_begin=10%2F30%2F2007&time_end=now&submit=Search Nate Silver's diaries as \"Poblano\" on ''Daily Kos''] (2007–2009)\n* [http://fivethirtyeight.com ''FiveThirtyEight.com'' from pre-NYT period] (2008–2010) and from ESPN period (2013–)\n* [http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/ FiveThirtyEight/NYT] (2010–2013)\n\n;Other publications\n**Nate Silver, \"The Most Livable Neighborhoods in New York: A Quantitative Index of the 50 Most Satisfying Places to Live,\" ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]],'' [http://nymag.com/realestate/neighborhoods/2010/65374/ April 11, 2010].\n**Nate Silver, \"The Influence Index,\" ''Time,'' [http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984713_1984669,00.html April 29, 2010].\n**Nate Silver and Walter Hickey, \"Best Picture Math,\" ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]],'' [http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/03/oscar-winner-predictions-nate-silver March 2014].\n**[[Gareth Cook]] (Editor), Nate Silver (Introduction).

The citation read: \"2015 Warren J. Mitofsky Innovators Award to Nate Silver for Contributions to the General Public and Mass Media in the Realm of Statistical Literacy and Thinking. Through his work as Founding Director and Editor in Chief of FiveThirtyEight.com Nate Silver has made significant, innovative contributions to how journalists report and the general public understands presidential and congressional elections in the United States, and how public opinion polling is used in that framework. Silver’s focus on the Electoral College, rather than the popular vote, has fundamentally reshaped how presidential elections are reported, leading to a greater public and journalistic awareness of how the electoral political process operates. Silver’s application of probability theory and statistical inference to politics, public policy, economics, and daily life in FiveThirtyEight.com has advanced and highlighted statistical literacy and thinking as an approach to solving problems in a number of areas. One example is in the use of polling aggregation to identify central tendencies and outliers in the analysis of elections. AAPOR also recognizes and laud’s Silver’s commitment to transparency and full disclosure in FiveThirtyEight’s research methods and practice. These principles remain the bedrock on which scientific inquiry is grounded\".</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nSilver has been criticized for inaccurate predictions. In January 2010, journalist and blogger [[Colby Cosh]] criticized Silver's performance during the [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|Massachusetts special Senate election]], saying he was \"still arguing as late as Thursday afternoon that Coakley was the clear favourite; he changed his mind at midnight that evening and acknowledged that Scott Brown had a puncher’s chance.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Cosh|first=Colby|title=Mr. Overrated|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/01/19/mr-overrated/|accessdate=November 6, 2012|newspaper=Macleans|date=January 19, 2010}}</ref> (Brown won the election.)\n\nSilver's quantitative focus on polling data, without insight from experience in political organizing or journalism, has been a recurring critique from experienced commentators. ''Huffington Post'' columnist Geoffrey Dunn described Silver as someone who \"has never organized a precinct in his life, much less walked one, pontificating about the dynamics in the electoral processes as if he actually understood them.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Dunn|first=Geoffrey|title=FiveThirtyHate?: Nate Silver Gets His Numbers Crossed in Charlotte|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/geoffrey-dunn/fivethirtyhate-nate-silve_b_1863634.html|accessdate=November 3, 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=September 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nConsiderable criticism during the 2012 elections came from political conservatives, who argued that Silver's election projections were politically biased against [[Mitt Romney]], the Republican candidate for President.<ref>Gregory Ferenstein, \"Why Pundits and Politicians Hate NYT Election Forecaster Nate Silver,\" [http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/30/why-pundits-and-politicians-hate-nyt-election-forecaster-nate-silver/ [[TechCrunch]], October 30, 2012].</ref> For example, Silver was accused of applying a double standard to his treatment of [[Rasmussen Reports]] polls, such as a 2010 analysis asserting a statistical bias in its methodology.<ref>Nate Silver, \"Rasmussen Polls Were Biased and Inaccurate; Quinnipiac, SurveyUSA Performed Strongly,\" [http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/rasmussen-polls-were-biased-and-inaccurate-quinnipiac-surveyusa-performed-strongly/ FiveThirtyEight, November 4, 2010].</ref> Mendy Finkel of ''[[Daily Caller]]'' wrote that \"Silver rigged his entire pollster ratings for the sole purpose of lowering Rasmussen's rank\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=Mendy|title=Nate Silver’s Rasmussen obsession|url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/11/02/nate-silvers-rasmussen-obsession|accessdate=November 3, 2012|newspaper=Daily Caller|date=November 2, 2012}}</ref> Josh Jordan wrote in ''[[National Review]]'' that Silver clearly favored Obama and adjusted the weight he gave polls \"based on what [he] think[s] of the pollster and the results and not based on what is actually inside the poll\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jordan|first=Josh|title=Nate Silver’s Flawed Model|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/331192/nate-silver-s-flawed-model-josh-jordan|accessdate=November 3, 2012|newspaper=National Review|date=October 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[Morning Joe]]'', host [[Joe Scarborough]] stated that Silver's prediction that day of a 73.6% chance of a win for Obama greatly exceeded the confidence of the Obama campaign itself, which Scarborough equated to that of the Romney campaign, both believing \"they have a 50.1 percent chance of winning\", and calling Silver an \"ideologue\" and a \"joke\". Silver responded with the offer of a $1,000 wager (for charity) over the outcome of the election. ''The New York Times'' public editor Margaret Sullivan, while defending Silver's analysis, characterized the wager as \"a bad idea\" as it gave the appearance of a partisan motive for Silver, and \"inappropriate\" for someone perceived as a ''Times'' journalist (although Silver was not a member of the newspaper's staff).<ref>{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Margaret|title=Under Attack, Nate Silver Picks the Wrong Defense|url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/under-attack-nate-silver-picks-the-wrong-defense/|accessdate=November 3, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 1, 2012}}.

But I do need to tell Nate I’m sorry for leaning in too hard and lumping him with pollsters whose methodology is as rigorous as the Simpsons’ strip mall physician, Dr. Nick. For those sins (and a multitude of others that I’m sure I don’t even know about), I am sorry.\n\nPolitics is a messy sport. And just as ball players who drink beer and eat fried chicken in dugouts across America can screw up the smartest sabermatrician’s forecast, Nate Silver’s formula is sure to let his fervent admirers down from time to time.

[[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']] journalist [[Ezra Klein]] wrote: \"There are good criticisms to make of Silver's model, not the least of which is that, while Silver is almost tediously detailed about what's going on in the model, he won’t give out the code, and without the code, we can't say with certainty how the model works.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Ezra|title=The Nate Silver backlash|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/30/the-nate-silver-backlash/|accessdate=November 3, 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=October 30, 2012}}</ref> Colby Cosh wrote that the model \"is proprietary and irreproducible.
