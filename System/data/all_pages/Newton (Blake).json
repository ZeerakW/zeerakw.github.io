Collection Tate Britain]]\n'''''Newton''''' is a [[monotype]] by the English [[English poetry|poet]], [[Painting|painter]] and [[printmaker]] [[William Blake]] first completed in 1795,<ref>Townsend, 32</ref> but reworked and reprinted in 1805.<ref>The website of [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=1122&tabview=work The Tate Britain], retrieved 10 September 2009. The paper it is printed on is watermarked 1804</ref> It is one of the 12 \"Large Colour Prints\" or \"Large Colour Printed Drawings\" created between 1795 and 1805, which also include his series of images on the biblical ruler ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (Blake)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''.\n\n[[Isaac Newton]] is shown sitting naked and crouched on a rocky outcropping covered with algae, apparently at the bottom of the sea. His attention is focused upon diagrams he draws with a compass upon a scroll that appears to unravel from his mouth.<ref>Kaiser, Christopher B. ''Creational Theology and the History of Physical Science''. 1997, page 328.</ref> The compass is a smaller version of that held by [[Urizen]] in Blake's [[The Ancient of Days]].\n\nBlake's opposition to the Enlightenment was deeply rooted. He wrote in his annotations to the ''Laocoon'' \"Art is the Tree of Life. Science is the Tree of Death.\"<ref>Burwick, Frederick (1986) ''The Damnation of Newton: Goethe's Color Theory and Romantic Perception.'' Walter de Gruyter. ISBN 0-89925-207-9 Page 8</ref> Newton's theory of optics was especially offensive to Blake, who made a clear distinction between the vision of the \"vegetative eye\" and spiritual vision. The [[Deism|deistic]] view of God as a distant creator who played no role in daily affairs was anathema to Blake, who claimed to regularly experience visions of a spiritual nature. He opposes his \"four-fold vision\" to the \"single vision\" of Newton, whose \"natural religion\" of scientific materialism he characterized as sterile.\n\nNewton was incorporated into Blake's infernal trinity along with the philosophers [[Francis Bacon]] and [[John Locke]].<ref>{{Cite book | author=Damon, S.
