In 1832, he married Varvara Alexeyevna Moiseyeva. They had a large number of children (eighteen according to his son's memoirs, while only seven apparently survived into adulthood). He was dismissed from the university in 1846, ostensibly due to his deteriorating health: by the early 1850s, he was nearly blind and unable to walk. He died in poverty in 1856.\n\nHe was an [[atheist]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bardi|first=Jason|title=The Fifth Postulate: How Unraveling a Two Thousand Year Old Mystery Unraveled the Universe|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-46736-7|page=186|quote=His stubbornness, reported atheism, and genius supported his rise as a champion of the proletariat.

It is said that he was an atheist.}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nLobachevsky's main achievement is the development (independently from [[János Bolyai]]) of a [[non-Euclidean geometry]],<ref name=\"Hawking\"/> also referred to as Lobachevskian geometry. Before him, mathematicians were trying to deduce [[Euclid]]'s [[fifth postulate]] from other [[axiom]]s. Euclid's fifth is a rule in Euclidean geometry which states (in [[John Playfair]]'s reformulation) that for any given line and point not on the line, there is one parallel line through the point not intersecting the line. Lobachevsky would instead develop a [[geometry]] in which the fifth postulate was not true. This idea was first reported on February 23 (Feb. 11, [[Old Style|O.S.]]), 1826 to the session of the department of physics and mathematics, and this research was printed in the UMA\n(Вестник Казанского университета) in 1829&ndash;1830. Lobachevsky wrote a paper about it called ''A concise outline of the foundations of geometry'' that was published by the ''Kazan Messenger'' but was rejected when it was submitted to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences for publication.\n\nThe non-Euclidean geometry that Lobachevsky developed is referred to as [[hyperbolic geometry]]. Lobachevsky replaced [[Playfair's axiom]] with the statement that for any given point there exists ''more than'' one line that can be extended through that point and run parallel to another line of which that point is not part. He developed the [[angle of parallelism]] which depends on the distance the point is off the given line. In hyperbolic geometry the sum of angles in a [[hyperbolic triangle]] must be less than 180 degrees.  [[Non-Euclidean geometry]] stimulated the development of [[differential geometry]] which has many applications. Hyperbolic geometry is frequently referred to as \"Lobachevskian geometry\" or \"Bolyai–Lobachevskian geometry\".\n\nSome mathematicians and historians have wrongfully claimed that Lobachevsky in his studies in non-Euclidean geometry was influenced by Gauss, which is untrue—Gauss himself appreciated Lobachevsky's published works very highly, but they never had personal correspondence between them prior to the publication. In fact out of the three people that can be credited with discovery of hyperbolic geometry—Gauss, Lobachevsky and Bolyai, Lobachevsky rightfully deserves having his name attached to it, since Gauss never published his ideas and out of the latter two Lobachevsky was the first who duly presented his views to the world mathematical community.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Lobachevsky}}</ref> \n\nLobachevsky's magnum opus ''Geometriya'' was completed in 1823, but was not published in its exact original form until 1909, long after he had died. Lobachevsky was also the author of ''New Foundations of Geometry'' (1835–1838). He also wrote ''Geometrical Investigations on the Theory of Parallels'' (1840)<ref>The 1914 English translation by George Bruce Halsted is available at {{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=umhistmath;idno=AAN2339 |title=Quod.lib.umich.edu |publisher=The University of Michigan Historical Mathematics Collection |date= |accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref> and ''Pangeometry'' (1855).<ref>The 1902 German translation by Heinrich Liebmann is available at {{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=umhistmath;idno=ABR5311 |title=Quod.lib.umich.edu |publisher=The University of Michigan Historical Mathematics Collection |date= |accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref><ref>Lobachevsky dictated two versions of that work, a first one in Russian, and a second one in French (Papadopoulos 2010, p. v).</ref>\n\nAnother of Lobachevsky's achievements was developing a method for the [[approximation]] of the [[Root of a function|root]]s of [[algebraic equation]]s. This method is now known as the [[Dandelin&ndash;Gräffe method]], named after two other mathematicians who discovered it independently. In Russia, it is called the Lobachevsky method. Lobachevsky gave the definition of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] as a correspondence between two sets of real numbers ([[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] gave the same definition independently soon after Lobachevsky).\n\n==Impact==\n[[Eric Temple Bell|E.T. Bell]] wrote about Lobachevsky's influence on the following development of mathematics in his 1937 book ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'': <blockquote>The boldness of his challenge and its successful outcome have inspired mathematicians and scientists in general to challenge other 'axioms' or accepted 'truths', for example the 'law' of causality which, for centuries, have seemed as necessary to straight thinking as Euclid's postulate appeared till Lobatchewsky discarded it. The full impact of the Lobatchewskian method of challenging axioms has probably yet to be felt. It is no exaggeration to call Lobatchewsky the Copernicus of Geometry, for geometry is only a part of the vaster domain which he renovated; it might even be just to designate him as a Copernicus of all thought.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=E.
