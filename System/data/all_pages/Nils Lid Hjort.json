Hjort's research themes are varied, with particularly noteworthy contributions in the fields of [[Bayesian probability]] (Beta processes for use in non- and semi-parametric models, particularly within [[survival analysis]] and event history analysis, but also with links to Indian buffet processes in [[machine learning]]), [[density estimation]] and [[nonparametric regression]] (local likelihood methodology), and [[model selection]] ([[Focused information criterion|focused information criteria]] and model averaging). An article on [[Focused information criterion|frequentist model averaging]], with co-author [[Gerda Claeskens]], was selected as ''Fast Breaking Paper in the field of mathematics'' by the Essential Science Indicators in 2005. He has also worked with [[spatial statistics]], statistics of [[remote sensing]], [[pattern recognition]], etc.\n\nHjort is a core member of the Centre of Excellence [[Nils Christian Stenseth|Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis]], on the scientific advisory board of the Centre for Innovation [[Arnoldo Frigessi|Statistics for Innovation]], and also involved with the [[Odd Aalen|Centre for Biostatistical Modelling in the Medical Sciences]], all within the [[University of Oslo]]. Hjort is an elected member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] since 1999, and was the third recipient of the [[Sverdrup Prize]], awarded by the Norwegian Statistical Association in 2013.\n\nHjort has also served on the [[editorial board]]s on various journals dedicated to the methodology and application of statistical research, including the ''Scandinavian Journal of Statistics'', ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B]]'', and the ''[[Annals of Statistics]]'', and has been on the programme committees of numerous international conferences. He is leading the 2014–2018 [[Research Council of Norway]] funded project ''FocuStat: Focus Driven Statistical Inference With Complex Data'' at the University of Oslo.\n\nOn the applied side, Hjort demonstrated in 1994 that there is a small but Olympically significant difference between inner-lane and outer-lane starts for 500&nbsp;m [[speedskating]] races, after a systematic analysis of world sprint championships data, implying that the Olympic 500&nbsp;m event has been unfair since 1924. As a result of Hjort's work and initiative, the [[International Skating Union]] and the [[International Olympic Committee]] changed the rules; since Nagano 1998 onwards, the sprint skaters race the 500&nbsp;m twice, with one start in inner lane and one start in the outer lane. He is also a regular contributor to the ''[[Speedskating World]]'' magazine. Other applied work has involved analysis of literary texts. In the famous case of potential plagiarism where [[Solzhenitsyn|Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and others accused [[Sholokhov|Mikhail Sholokhov]] of not being the rightful author of ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]'', Hjort's analysis gives full support to Sholokhov.\n\nHjort's other interests include [[Disney comics]] (where he has given public lectures and written scholarly articles for various publishers), [[chamber music]] and [[choir|choir singing]] (taking part in more than ten CD recordings with [[Grex Vocalis]]), [[gøbbing]] (exchanging ideas with members of a [[think tank]]) and [[cross-country skiing]]. He has edited two books with the works of notable Disney comics artist [[Don Rosa]].\n\nNils Lid Hjort is one of five sons of [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]] lawyer Johan Hjort and Helga Lid, and his grandfathers were Supreme Court lawyer [[Johan Bernhard Hjort]] and ethnologist Nils Lid. Among his brothers is typographer, designer and [[rock music|rock music historian]] [[Christopher Hjort]], and his cousins include writer and publisher [[Anders Heger]], mayor of Tromsø Jens Johan Hjort, violinist and conductor [[Gottfried von der Goltz]], and cellist [[Kristin von der Goltz]]. \n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pGvWCH4AAAAJ&hl=en List of Hjort's publications] via [[Google Scholar]]\n* [http://www.cristin.no/as/WebObjects/cristin.woa/2/wa/personVis?type=PERSON&pnr=14869&la=en&inst=185 Hjort's page] with the [[University of Oslo]]\n* [http://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/research/projects/focustat/index.html The FocuStat website: Focus Driven Statistical Inference With Complex Data] \n* [http://www.esi-topics.com/fbp/2005/august05-Hjort_Claeskens.html Interview on frequentist model averaging] Essential Science Indicators interview regarding \"this month's fast breaking paper in the field of Mathematics\", August 2005\n* [http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2004/desember/1102088985.3 Mangfoldig talltrollmann] Interview in forskning.no\n* [http://www.physorg.com/news2487.html The physics of Santa Claus] Hjort and other scholars argue for the existence of Santa Claus\n* [http://www.wcsc.nl/ The annual World Cup Speedskating Contest] Each year participants from a dozen countries compete for the Nils Lid Hjort trophy\n* [http://www.donaldisme.dk/ALDA04.htm The Annual Ludwig von Drake Award] Hjort was its first recipient\n* [http://duckman.pettho.com/personal/tronsmo.html The two Don Rosa books] These feature [[Captain Kentucky|Lancelot Pertwillaby]] and [[Captain Kentucky]]\n* [http://www.wolfstad.com/dcw/blog/2009/03/rare-don-rosa-speedskating-story/ Speedskating Race of the Burg of Ducks] With Disney comics artist [[Don Rosa]]\n* [http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/STK4160/v11/olympic_partone.pdf The Olympic 500-m] The Statistical Research Report that contributed to changing the Olympic Rules\n* [http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/STK4160/v11/olympic_parttwo.pdf The Olympic 500-m, Appendix] Part two of the Research Report \n* [http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2006/02/18/jan-bos-benadeeld-door-start-in-buitenbaan-1000-m.aspx The Olympic 1000-m] Research implying an Olympically significant unfairness also for the 1000-m\n* [http://www.cas.uio.no/Publications/Seminar/Consilience_LidHjort.pdf And Quiet Does not Flow the Don: Statistical Analysis of a Quarrel between Nobel Laureates] [[Solzhenitsyn]] vs. [[Sholokhov]], 2007\n* [http://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/programmes/BNR/ Bayesian Nonparametrics at the Isaac Newton Institute] The research programme and conference on Bayesian Nonparametrics, 2007\n\n* ''[http://www.oup.co.uk/isbn/0-19-851055-1 Highly Structured Stochastic Systems]'' Oxford University Press book, 2003\n* ''[http://www.econ.kuleuven.be/public/ndbaf45/modelselection/index.html Model Selection and Model Averaging]'' Cambridge University Press book, 2008\n* ''[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521513463 Bayesian Nonparametrics]'' Cambridge University Press book, 2010\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Hjort, Nils Lid\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Professor, statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 12 January 1953\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hjort, Nils Lid}}\n[[Category:Norwegian statisticians]]\n[[Category:1953 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Members of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Nils Lid Hjort"}}}}
