He was Professor of Mathematics at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].\n\nA famous [[child prodigy]], Wiener later became an early researcher in [[stochastic processes|stochastic]] and [[noise]] processes, contributing work relevant to [[electronic engineering]], [[electronic communication]], and [[control system]]s.\n\nWiener is considered the originator of [[cybernetics]], a formalization of the notion of [[feedback]], with implications for [[engineering]], [[systems control]], [[computer science]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], and the organization of [[society]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Youth===\nWiener was born in [[Columbia, Missouri]], the first child of [[Leo Wiener]] and Bertha Kahn, [[Jews]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Norbert Wiener|website = [[NNDB]]|url = http://www.nndb.com/people/229/000103917/|accessdate = March 25, 2014}}</ref> of [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Germany|German]] origin, respectively. Leo had educated Norbert at home until 1903, employing teaching methods of his own invention,  except for a brief interlude when Norbert was 7 years of age.  Earning his living teaching German and [[Slavic languages]], Leo read widely and accumulated a personal library from which the young Norbert benefited greatly. Leo also had ample ability in mathematics and tutored his son in the subject until he left home.  In his autobiography, Norbert described his father as calm and patient, unless he (Norbert) failed to give a correct answer, at which his father would lose his temper.\n\nHe became an agnostic.<ref>{{harvnb|\"On June 2, 1964, Swami Sarvagatananda presided over the memorial service at MIT in remembrance of Norbert Wiener&nbsp;– scion of Maimonides, father of cybernetics, avowed agnostic&nbsp;– reciting in Sanskrit from the holy books of Hinduism, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita.\" |Conway|Siegelman|2005|p=329}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating from [[Ayer High School]] in 1906 at 11 years of age, Wiener entered [[Tufts College]]. He was awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in mathematics in 1909 at the age of 14, whereupon he began graduate studies of [[zoology]] at [[Harvard]].  In 1910 he transferred to [[Cornell University|Cornell]] to study philosophy.\n\n===Harvard and World War I===\n\nThe next year he returned to Harvard, while still continuing his philosophical studies. Back at Harvard, Wiener became influenced by [[Edward Vermilye Huntington]], whose mathematical interests ranged from axiomatic foundations to engineering problems. Harvard awarded Wiener a [[Ph.D.]] in 1912, when he was merely 17 years old, for a dissertation on [[mathematical logic]], supervised by Karl Schmidt, the essential results of which were published as Wiener (1914). In that dissertation, he was the first to state publicly that [[ordered pair]]s can be defined in terms of elementary [[set theory]]. Hence [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] can be defined by [[set theory]], thus the theory of relations does not require any axioms or primitive notions distinct from those of set theory. In 1921, [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] proposed a simplification of Wiener's definition of ordered pairs, and that simplification has been in common use ever since. It is (x, y) = {{x}, {x, y}}.\n\nIn 1914, Wiener traveled to Europe, to be taught by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G. H. Hardy]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], and by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Edmund Landau]] at the [[University of Göttingen]]. During 1915–16, he taught philosophy at Harvard, then was an engineer for [[General Electric]] and wrote for the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''. Wiener was briefly a journalist for the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', where he wrote a feature story on the poor labor conditions for mill workers in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], but he was fired soon afterwards for his reluctance to write favorable articles about a politician the newspaper's owners sought to promote.<ref>{{harvnb|Conway|Siegelman|2005|p=45}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Wiener eventually became a staunch pacifist, he eagerly contributed to the war effort in World War I. In 1916, with [[United States in World War I|America's entry into the war]] drawing closer, Wiener attended a training camp for potential military officers, but failed to earn a commission. One year later Wiener again tried to join the military, but the government again rejected him due to his poor eyesight. In the summer of 1918, [[Oswald Veblen]] invited Wiener to work on [[ballistics]] at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in Maryland.<ref>{{harvnb|Conway|Siegelman|2005|pp=41–43}}</ref> Living and working with other mathematicians strengthened his interest in mathematics. However, Wiener was still eager to serve in uniform, and decided to make one more attempt to enlist, this time as a common soldier. Wiener wrote in a letter to his parents, \"I should consider myself a pretty cheap kind of a swine if I were willing to be an officer but unwilling to be a soldier\".<ref>{{harvnb|Conway|Siegelman|2005|p=43}}</ref> This time the army accepted Wiener into its ranks and assigned him, by coincidence, to a unit stationed at Aberdeen, Maryland. World War I ended just days after Wiener's return to Aberdeen and Wiener was discharged from the military in February 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Conway|Siegelman|2005|pp=43–44}}</ref>\n\n===After the war===\n[[File:MIT Building 10 and the Great Dome, Cambridge MA.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Norbert Wiener was regarded as a semi-legendary figure at MIT]]\nWiener was unable to secure a permanent position at Harvard, a situation he blamed largely on [[anti-semitism]] at the university and in particular on the antipathy of Harvard mathematician [[George David Birkhoff|G. D. Birkhoff]].<ref>{{harvnb|Conway|Siegelman|2005|pp=40, 45}}</ref> He was also rejected for a position at the [[University of Melbourne]]. At [[William Fogg Osgood|W. F. Osgood's]] suggestion, Wiener became an instructor of mathematics at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], where he spent the remainder of his career, becoming promoted eventually to Professor. There is a photograph of him prominently displayed in one of the hallways, often used in giving directions.\n\nIn 1926, Wiener returned to Europe as a [[Guggenheim scholar]]. He spent most of his time at Göttingen and with Hardy at Cambridge, working on [[Brownian motion]], the [[Fourier integral]], [[Dirichlet's problem]], harmonic analysis, and the [[Tauberian theorems]].\n\nIn 1926, Wiener's parents arranged his marriage to a German immigrant, Margaret Engemann; they had two daughters. His sister, Constance, married [[Philip Franklin]]. Their daughter, Janet, Wiener's niece, married [[Václav E. Beneš]].<ref>[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Franklin.html Franklin biography]. History.mcs.st-and.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2013-11-02.</ref>\n\nMany tales, perhaps apocryphal, were told of him at MIT, especially concerning his absent-mindedness.  It was said that he returned home once to find his house empty.  He inquired of a neighborhood girl the reason, and she said that the family had moved elsewhere that day.  He thanked her for the information and she replied, \"That's why I stayed behind, Daddy!\"<ref>{{harvnb|Adams|Hass|Thompson|2008|p=8}}</ref>\n\n===During and after World War II===\nDuring [[World War II]], his work on the automatic aiming and firing of [[anti-aircraft gun]]s caused Wiener to investigate [[information theory]] independently of [[Claude Shannon]] and to invent the [[Wiener filter]]. (To him is due the now standard practice of modeling an information source as a random process—in other words, as a variety of noise.) His anti-aircraft work eventually led him to formulate [[cybernetics]].<ref>{{harvnb|Conway|Siegelman|2005|p=12}}</ref> After the war, his fame helped MIT to recruit a research team in [[cognitive science]], composed of researchers in [[neuropsychology]] and the mathematics and [[biophysics]] of the nervous system, including [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]]. These men later made pioneering contributions to [[computer science]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. Soon after the group was formed, Wiener suddenly ended all contact with its members, mystifying his colleagues. This emotionally traumatized [[Walter Pitts]], and led to his career decline. In their biography of Wiener, [[Flo Conway|Conway]] and [[Jim Siegelman|Siegelman]] suggest that Wiener's wife Margaret, who detested McCulloch's [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, engineered the breach.<ref>{{harvnb|Conway|Siegelman|2005|pp=223–7}}</ref>\n\nWiener later helped develop the theories of cybernetics, [[robotics]], computer control, and [[automation]]. He discussed the modeling of neurons with [[John von Neumann]], and in a letter from November 1946 von Neumann presented his thoughts in advance of a meeting with Wiener.<ref>Letters to Norbert Wiener in ''John von Neumann: Selected Letters'', edited by Miklós  Rédei, in ''History of Mathematics, Volume 27'', jointly published by the American Mathematical Society and the London Mathematical Society, 2005</ref>\n\nWiener always shared his theories and findings with other researchers, and credited the contributions of others. These included [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] researchers and their findings. Wiener's acquaintance with them caused him to be regarded with suspicion during the [[Cold War]]. He was a strong advocate of automation to improve the standard of living, and to end economic underdevelopment. His ideas became influential in [[India]], whose government he advised during the 1950s.\n\nAfter the war, Wiener became increasingly concerned with what he believed was political interference with scientific research, and the militarization of science. His article \"A Scientist Rebels\" for the January 1947 issue of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''<ref>{{cite news |author=Wiener, Norbert |title=A Scientist Rebels |newspaper=Atlantic Monthly |page=46 |date=January 1947 |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theatlantic/access/66236828.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=&type=current}}</ref> urged scientists to consider the ethical implications of their work. After the war, he refused to accept any government funding or to work on military projects. The way Wiener's beliefs concerning nuclear weapons and the Cold War contrasted with those of [[John von Neumann]] is the major theme of the book ''John Von Neumann and Norbert Wiener''.<ref>{{harvnb|Heims|1980}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=The editor obviously knew that Heims wrote something in 1980 but did not have time to specify it.

He died, aged 69, in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].\n\n===Awards and honors===\n* Wiener won the [[Bôcher Memorial Prize]] in 1933 and the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1963, presented by President Johnson at a White House Ceremony in January, 1964, shortly before Wiener's death.\n* Wiener won the 1965 U.S. [[National Book Award]] [[National Book Award for Philosophy and Religion|in Science, Philosophy and Religion]] for ''[[God & Golem, Inc.]]: A Comment on Certain Points where Cybernetics Impinges on Religion''.<ref name=nba1965>\n[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1965.html \"National Book Awards – 1965\"].

It can be visualized as a cylinder of fixed radius the centerline of which is Brownian motion.]]\n\n===Wiener equation===\nA simple mathematical representation of [[Brownian motion]], the [[Wiener equation]], named after Wiener, assumes the current [[velocity]] of a [[fluid]] particle fluctuates randomly.\n\n===Wiener filter===\nFor signal processing, the [[Wiener filter]] is a [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] proposed by Wiener during the 1940s and published in 1949. Its purpose is to reduce the amount of [[noise]] present in a signal by comparison with an estimation of the desired noiseless signal.\n\n===In mathematics===\nWiener took a great interest in the mathematical theory of [[Brownian motion]] (named after [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]]) proving many results now widely known such as the non-differentiability of the paths. Consequently, the one-dimensional version of Brownian motion was named the [[Wiener process]]. It is the best known of the [[Lévy process]]es, [[càdlàg]] stochastic processes with stationary statistically independent increments, and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, physics and economics (e.g. on the stock-market).\n\nWiener's Tauberian theorem, a 1932 result of Wiener, developed [[Tauberian theorem]]s in [[summability theory]], on the face of it a chapter of [[real analysis]], by showing that most of the known results could be encapsulated in a principle taken from [[harmonic analysis]]. In its present formulation, the theorem of Wiener does not have any obvious association with Tauberian theorems, which deal with [[infinite series]]; the translation from results formulated for integrals, or using the language of [[functional analysis]] and [[Banach algebra]]s, is however a relatively routine process.\n\nThe [[Paley–Wiener theorem]] relates growth properties of [[entire function]]s on '''C'''<sup>n</sup> and Fourier transformation of Schwartz distributions of compact support.\n\nThe [[Wiener–Khinchin theorem]], (or ''Wiener – Khintchine theorem'' or ''Khinchin – Kolmogorov theorem''), states that the power spectral density of a wide-sense-stationary random process is the Fourier transform of the corresponding autocorrelation function.\n\nAn [[abstract Wiener space]] is a mathematical object in [[measure theory]], used to construct a \"decent\", strictly positive and locally finite measure on an infinite-dimensional vector space. Wiener's original construction only applied to the space of real-valued continuous paths on the unit interval, known as [[classical Wiener space]]. Leonard Gross provided the generalization to the case of a general [[separable space|separable]] [[Banach space]].\n\nThe notion of a Banach space itself was discovered independently by both Wiener and [[Stefan Banach]] at around the same time.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Note on a paper of M.
