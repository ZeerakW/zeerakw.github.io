In 2015, he is Professor (Emeritus) of Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, of the [[University of Washington]].  He is co-author or author of hundreds of published works during 1992 to 2015.<ref>[http://faculty.washington.edu/norm/publications.html Publications]</ref>\n\nAmong his many accomplishments is his work with co-author [[Nicholas Day (statistician)|Nicholas Day]] that developed and popularized the use of [[case-control]] matched sample [[research design]]s, in the two-volume work ''Statistical Methods in Cancer Research''.  This was with view that matched sample studies have a role within larger program of many types of studies, in making progress on a vast and important problem like cancer.  Matched sample studies can quickly and cheaply test some hypothesized relationships, but their apparent findings are not definitive, and there's much they cannot accomplish.  Their results, however, can inform the design of slow and expensive longitudinal large-cohort studies that are definitive, for example.  Dose-response studies and other studies, too, are elements of a rational scientific program to address cancer.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* 1980, Statistical Methods in Cancer Research: Volume 1—The Analysis of Case-Control Studies, The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], Lyon, France.\n* 1987, Statistical Methods in Cancer Research: Volume 2—The Design and Analysis of Cohort Studies, The International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.\n* 1996, \"Statistics in Epidemiology: The Case-Control Study\", Journal of the American Statistical Association, 91(433): p 14-28.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.biostat.washington.edu/breslow-conference-2006/NormBreslow.php Conference on Statistical Methods in Epidemiology and Observational Studies]\n* {{MathGenealogy |id=47763 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Breslow, Norman\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = February 21, 1941\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Breslow, Norman}}\n[[Category:1941 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:American medical researchers]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:ISI highly cited researchers]]\n\n\n{{US-statistician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Norman Breslow"}}}}
