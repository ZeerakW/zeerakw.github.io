Johnson''' (born November 12, 1930) is a [[mathematician]], previously at [[Wheaton College, Massachusetts|Wheaton College]], [[Norton, Massachusetts]].  He earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1966 with a dissertation title of ''The Theory of Uniform Polytopes and Honeycombs'' under the supervision of  [[H. S. M. Coxeter]].\n\nIn his 1966 doctoral thesis Johnson discovered three uniform [[antiprism]]-like [[star polytope]]s named the [[Johnson antiprism]]s. Their bases are the three [[ditrigonal polyhedron|ditrigonal polyhedra]]&nbsp;– the [[small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron]], [[ditrigonal dodecadodecahedron]] and the [[great ditrigonal icosidodecahedron]].\n\nIn 1966 he enumerated 92 convex non-uniform polyhedra with regular faces.  [[Victor Zalgaller]] later proved (1969) that Johnson's list was complete, and the set is now known as the [[Johnson solid]]s.\n\nMore recently, Johnson has participated in the [[Uniform Polychora Project]], an effort to find and name higher-dimensional [[polytopes]].<ref>[http://www.mit.edu/~hlb/Associahedron/program.pdf] CONVEX AND ABSTRACT POLYTOPES Workshop (2005), N.Johnson — Uniform Polychora abstract</ref>\n\nThe literature on polytopes contains several references to a manuscript by Johnson titled ''Uniform Polytopes''. Although a few paper copies were circulated in the 1990s, the manuscript is still unpublished (as of 2015) and copies of it are hard to find.\n\n== Works ==\n*''Hyperbolic Coxeter Groups'' <ref>[http://atlas-conferences.com/c/a/n/m/20.htm The Coxeter Legacy: Reflections and Projections May 12-16, 2004 The Fields Institute Toronto, ON, Canada]</ref>\n*{{cite journal | last=Johnson | first=Norman W. | authorlink=Norman Johnson (mathematician) | title=Convex polyhedra with regular faces | journal=Canadian Journal of Mathematics | volume=18 | year=1966 | pages=169–200 | zbl=0132.14603 | issn=0008-414X | doi=10.4153/cjm-1966-021-8|mr=0185507}} Contains the original enumeration of the 92 solids and the conjecture that there are no others.\n* ''The Theory of Uniform Polytopes and Honeycombs'', Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Toronto, 1966<ref>https://getinfo.de/app/The-theory-of-uniform-polytopes-and-honeycombs/id/TIBKAT%3A22693604X</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=16046|name=Norman W.
