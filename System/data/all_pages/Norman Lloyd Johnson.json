During [[World War II]], he served under his former Professor [[Egon Pearson]] as an Experimental Officer with the [[Ordnance Board]].  He returned to the Statistics Department at UCL in 1945 and stayed there until 1962, as Assistant Lecturer, Lecturer and then Reader. In 1948 he was awarded a Ph.D. in Statistics for his work on the [[Johnson system of frequency curves]].  In 1949 he became a Fellow of the [[Institute of Actuaries]].\n\nTwo visiting appointments in the USA, at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (UNC) in 1952–1953 and at [[Case Institute of Technology]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], in 1960–1961, led to his permanent appointment as Professor in the Department of Statistics at UNC in 1962.  He was Chairman 1971–1976 and officially retired in 1982, but continued to be active in scholarship and research as [[Professor Emeritus]] almost until his death.  UNC named a distinguished endowed chair in his honour.  He expressed a wish to retire completely and return to live in Ilford, but never managed it.\n\n==Publications==\nHe wrote, together with [[Samuel Kotz]], a standard reference series, ''Distributions in Statistics''.  This series has been described as of \"virtually Biblical authority\", a comment that he (a devout Christian) firmly rejected.  He was editor-in-chief of the 10-volume ''[[Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences]]'', widely regarded as one of the most important reference works in statistical methodology.  He also wrote several textbooks and about 180 papers.  His book \"Survival Models\" was co-authored with his wife Regina Elandt Johnson, herself a professor of [[biostatistics]].\n\n==Honours==\nHe was honoured in numerous ways, including the [[Samuel Stanley Wilks|Wilks]] Award of the [[American Statistical Association]], the [[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] Medal of the [[American Society for Quality Control]] and a D.Sc. degree from UCL.\n\n==References==\n*Campbell B. Read (2004) A Conversation with Norman L.
