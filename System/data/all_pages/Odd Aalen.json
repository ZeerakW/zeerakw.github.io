Aalen's early work on [[counting process]]es and [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]], starting with his 1976 Ph.D. thesis at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], has had profound influence in [[biostatistics]]. Inferences for fundamental quantities associated with cumulative hazard rates, in [[survival analysis]] and models for analysis of event histories, are typically based on the [[Nelson–Aalen estimator]] or appropriate related statistics. The [[Nelson–Aalen estimator]] is related to the [[Kaplan-Meier estimator]] and generalisations thereof.\n\nAalen is currently the leader of the Centre for Biostatistical Modelling in the Medical Sciences at the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Oslo]]. \n==Honors and awards==\nHe is an elected member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MathGenealogy|id=34526}}\n* [http://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/research/networks/bmms/ The BMMS Centre]\n* [http://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/people/aca/oaalen/index.html Aalen's home page]\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Aalen, Odd Olai\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Norwegian statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 6 May 1947\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aalen, Odd Olai}}\n[[Category:1947 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Members of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]\n[[Category:Norwegian statisticians]]\n[[Category:University of Oslo faculty]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Oslo alumni]]\n[[Category:People educated at Oslo Cathedral School]]\n[[Category:People from Oslo]]\n\n{{norway-scientist-stub}}\n{{europe-mathematician-stub}}\n{{statistician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Odd Aalen"}}}}
