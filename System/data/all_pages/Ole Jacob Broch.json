Broch was born in [[Fredrikstad]], the son of war commissary Johan Jørgen Broch (1791–1860) and Jensine Laurentze Bentzen (1790–1877),<ref name=nbl/> and the brother of the orientalist [[Jens Peter Broch]]. He showed a talent for mathematics at an early age, and after studies in Christiania (today's [[Oslo]]), he travelled abroad. Through studies in [[Paris]], [[Berlin]] and [[Königsberg]], he developed an interest also for [[optics]] and [[statistics]].<ref name=nbl/>\n\nAfter returning to Norway, he worked with his friend and colleague [[Hartvig Nissen]] to found the school [[Hartvig Nissens skole]] in 1843, which were to have an emphasis on natural sciences and modern languages.<ref name=Brissach/> After finishing his doctorate in 1847, he returned to a position at the university that he had resigned to work with Nissen.<ref name=nbl/> He also taught at the [[Norwegian Military Academy|Military Academy]], and in 1847 he founded the [[insurance]] company [[Gjensidige]] (under the name \"Christiania almindelige, gjensidige Forsørgelsesanstalt\"),<ref name=Brissach/> which was [[Scandinavia]]'s first [[life insurance]] company.<ref name=nbl/>\n\nBroch entered politics as a local politician in Christiania, and in the period 1862–69 he represented the city in [[Storting|parliament]].<ref name=nbl/> In 1869, he was appointed Minister of the Navy in the [[Frederik Stang's Cabinet|first cabinet]] of [[Frederik Stang]]. After serving as a member of the Council of State Division in [[Stockholm]] in 1871–72, he returned as Minister of the Navy briefly in 1872.<ref name=Stang/> He resigned over differences with his colleagues about government ministers' access to the parliament.<ref name=snl/> After this his attention turned to international tasks. In 1879 he became a member, and in 1883 director of, the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] in [[Sèvres]], France.<ref name=nbl/> This work took up much of the remainder of Broch's life, but in 1884 he was recalled to Norway to attempt to form a government. The constitutional crisis which caused the fall of the so-called ''[[Schweigaard's Ministerium|April Ministerium]]'' of [[Christian Homann Schweigaard]], led to the demand for a new prime minister. Broch failed in this attempt, and returned to France, where he died a few years later.<ref name=nbl/>\n\nBroch received several honours for his scientific and political work. He was a member of the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]] from 1849, and he received the [[Grand Cross]] of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] in 1879.<ref name=nbl/> Internationally, he was created grand officer of the French ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'', and Commander Grand Cross of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Order of the Polar Star]].<ref name=nbl/>\n\nThe island [[Brochøya]], north of [[Nordaustlandet]], [[Svalbard]], is named after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miljo.npolar.no/placenames/pages/detailn.asp?placeNameID=01650A |title=Brochøya |publisher=[[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=nbl>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ole Jacob Broch|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first1=Gunnar Christie|last1=Wasberg|first2=Karen Mathilde |last2=Haugland|editor=Helle, Knut|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ole_Jacob_Broch/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 November 2013|editor-link=Knut Helle}}</ref>\n<ref name=snl>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ole Jacob Broch|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|editor=Henriksen, Petter|url=http://www.snl.no/Ole_Jacob_Broch|language=Norwegian|accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>\n<ref name=Brissach>{{cite news|url=http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/trondheim/byens_gater/article495282.ece|title=Den allsidige matematiker|last=Brissach|first=Ingrid J.|date=20 April 2005|work=[[Adresseavisen]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>\n<ref name=Stang>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/the-government/previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/governments/dissolution-of-the-danish-norwegian-real/governments-1814---1905/frederik-stangs-government-1861---1880.html?id=506810|title=Frederik Stang's Government|publisher=Government.no|accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last=Seip|first=Jens Arup|title=Ole Jakob Broch og hans samtid|year=1971|publisher=Gyldendal|location=Copenhagen|isbn=82-05-00401-3}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Broch, Ole Jacob\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Norwegian scholar and politician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 14 January 1818\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 5 February 1889\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Broch, Ole Jacob}}\n[[Category:1818 births]]\n[[Category:1889 deaths]]\n[[Category:Government ministers of Norway]]\n[[Category:Norwegian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Norwegian physicists]]\n[[Category:Norwegian economists]]\n[[Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Grand Officiers of the Légion d'honneur]]\n[[Category:Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]]\n[[Category:Commanders Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star]]\n[[Category:Norwegian Military Academy faculty]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Ole Jacob Broch"}}}}
