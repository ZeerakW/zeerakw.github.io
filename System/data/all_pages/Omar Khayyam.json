He wrote numerous treatises on [[mechanics]], [[geography and cartography in medieval Islam|geography]], [[mineralogy]] and [[astronomy]].\n\nBorn in [[Nishapur]], in northeastern [[Iran]], also known as Persia, at a young age he moved to [[Samarkand]] and obtained his education there. Afterwards he moved to [[Bukhara]] and became established as one of the major mathematicians and astronomers of the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. He is the author of one of the most important treatises on [[algebra]] written before modern times, the ''Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra'' (1070), which includes a geometric method for solving cubic equations by intersecting a [[hyperbola]] with a [[circle]].<ref name=mactutor>\n{{cite web\n|title = Omar Khayyam\n|url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Khayyam.html\n|publisher = The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive\n}}\n</ref> He contributed to a [[calendar reform]].\n\nHis significance as a philosopher and teacher, and his few remaining philosophical works, have not received the same attention as his scientific and poetic writings. [[Al-Zamakhshari]] referred to him as “the philosopher of the world”. He taught the philosophy of [[Avicenna]] for decades in Nishapur, where Khayyám was born and buried.

The greatest such impact was in English-speaking countries; the English scholar [[Thomas Hyde]] (1636–1703) was the first non-Persian to study him. The most influential of all was [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] (1809–83),<ref>[[#refkhayyam-EI|Jos Biegstraaten]]</ref> who made Khayyám the most famous poet of the East in the West through his celebrated translation and [[Untranslatability#Translation procedures|adaptations]] of Khayyám's rather small number of [[quatrain]]s ({{lang-fa|رباعیات}} ''rubāʿiyāt'') in the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]''.\n\nOmar Khayyám died in 1131 and is buried in the Khayyám Garden in [[Nishapur]]. The reconstruction of the tombs of Persian icons like [[Hafez]], [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]], Attar, [[Pour Sina]] and others were built by [[Reza Shah]] and in 1963, the [[Mausoleum of Omar Khayyám]] was reconstructed on the site by [[Hooshang Seyhoun]].\n\n==Name==\nغیاث ‌الدین Ghiyāth ad-Din - means \"the Shoulder of the Faith\" and implies the knowledge of the [[Quran]].<br />\nابوالفتح عمر بن ابراهیم Abu Fat'h 'Umar bin Ibrahim - Abu means father, Fat'h means conqueror, 'Umar means life, bin means son of, [[Ibrahim (name)|Ibrahim]] is the paternal name.<br /> \nخیام Khayyām - means \"tent maker\" it is a byname derived from the father's craft.<br />\nنیشابورﻯ Nīshāpūrī - is the link to his hometown of [[Nishapur]].\n\n==Early life==\nGhiyāth ad-Din Abu'l-Fat'h 'Umar ibn Ibrāhīm al-Khayyām Nīshāpūrī ({{lang-fa|غیاث الدین ابو الفتح عمر ابراهیم خیام نیشاپوری}}) was born in [[Nishapur]], in [[Iran]], then a [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] capital in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]],<ref>''The Tomb of Omar Khayyâm'', George Sarton, '''Isis''', Vol. 29, No. 1 (Jul., 1938), 15.</ref><ref>Edward FitzGerald, ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', Ed.

He is thought to have been born into a family of tent-makers (''khayyāmī'' \"tent-maker\"), which he would make into a play on words later in life:{{quotation|Khayyám, who stitched the tents of science,<br />Has fallen in grief's furnace and been suddenly burned,<br />The shears of Fate have cut the tent ropes of his life,<br />And the broker of Hope has sold him for nothing!|Omar Khayyám<ref name=mactutor/>}}\n\nHe spent part of his childhood in the town of [[Balkh]] (in present-day northern [[Afghanistan]]), studying under the well-known scholar Sheikh Muhammad Mansuri. He later studied under [[Imam]] Mowaffaq Nishapuri, who was considered one of the greatest teachers of the Khorasan region. Throughout his life, Omar Khayyám was tireless in his efforts; by day he would teach [[algebra]] and geometry, in the evening he would attend the Seljuq court as an adviser of [[Malik-Shah I]],<ref>Edward FitzGerald, ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', xv.</ref> and at night he would study [[astronomy]] and complete important aspects of the [[Jalali calendar]].\n\nOmar Khayyám's years in [[Isfahan]] were very productive ones, but after the death of the Seljuq [[Sultan]] [[Malik-Shah I]] (presumably by the [[Assassins]] sect), the Sultan's widow turned against him as an adviser, and as a result, he soon set out on his [[Hajj]] or pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].

He wrote the influential ''Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra'' (1070), which laid down the principles of [[algebra]], part of the body of Mathematics that was eventually transmitted to Europe. In particular, he derived general methods for solving cubic equations and even some higher orders.\n\n[[File:Khayyam-paper-1stpage.png|thumb|\"Cubic equation and intersection of conic sections\" the first page of two-chaptered manuscript kept in Tehran University]]\n\nIn the ''Treatise'', he wrote on the [[triangular array]] of [[binomial coefficient]]s known as [[Pascal's triangle]]. In 1077, Khayyám wrote ''Sharh ma ashkala min musadarat kitab Uqlidis'' (Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid) published in English as \"On the Difficulties of [[Euclid]]'s Definitions\".<ref>The Quatrains of Omar Khayyam  E.H. Whinfield Pg 14</ref> An important part of the book is concerned with Euclid's famous parallel postulate, which attracted the interest of [[Thabit ibn Qurra]]. [[Ibn al-Haytham|Al-Haytham]] had previously attempted a demonstration of the postulate; Khayyám's attempt was a distinct advance, and his criticisms made their way to Europe, and may have contributed to the eventual development of [[non-Euclidean geometry]].\n\nOmar Khayyám created important works on [[geometry]], specifically on the theory of proportions. His notable contemporary mathematicians included [[Al-Khazini]] and [[al-Isfizari|Abu Hatim al-Muzaffar ibn Ismail al-Isfizari]]<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/fstc/newsletter/issue8.htm |title=FSTC Newsletter, Issue 8: \"The Isfizari Project\" |publisher=Muslimheritage.com |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2012-05-30}}</ref>\n\n===Theory of parallels===\n{{See also|Non-Euclidean geometry#History|Parallel postulate#History|l1=History of non-Euclidean geometry|l2=Parallel postulate}}\n[[File:At the Tomb of Omar Khayyam - by Jay Hambidge.jpg|thumb|left|''At the Tomb of Omar Khayyam'', by [[Jay Hambidge]]]]\nKhayyám wrote a book entitled ''Explanations of the difficulties in the postulates in Euclid's Elements''. The book consists of several sections on the parallel postulate (Book I), on the Euclidean definition of ratios and the [[Anthyphairetic ratio]] (modern continued fractions) (Book II), and on the multiplication of ratios (Book III).\n\nThe first section is a treatise containing some propositions and lemmas concerning the parallel postulate. It has reached the Western world from a reproduction in a manuscript written in 1387-88 by the Persian mathematician Tusi. Tusi mentions explicitly that he re-writes the treatise \"in Khayyám's own words\" and quotes Khayyám, saying that \"they are worth adding to Euclid's Elements (first book) after Proposition 28.\"<ref>{{harv|Smith|1935|p=6}}</ref> This proposition<ref>\n{{cite web\n| author      = Euclid\n| authorlink  = Euclid\n| title       = Proposition 28\n| url         = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0086;query=proposition%3D%2328;layout=;loc=1.29\n| archiveurl  =\n| work        = Elements\n| location    = I. 28\n| quote       = If a [[straight line]] falling on two straight lines make the [[exterior angle]] equal to the [[interior angle|interior]] and [[Vertical (angles)|opposite angle]] on the same side, or the interior angles on the same side equal to two [[right angles]], the straight lines will be parallel to one another.\n}}</ref> states a condition enough for having two lines in plane parallel to one another.

Objection to the use of parallel postulate and alternative view of proposition 29 have been a major problem in foundation of what is now called non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nThe treatise of Khayyám can be considered the first treatment of the parallels axiom not based on [[petitio principii]], but on a more intuitive postulate. Khayyám refutes the [[Parallel postulate#History|previous attempts]] by other Greek and Persian mathematicians to ''prove'' the proposition. And he, as Aristotle, refuses the use of motion in geometry and therefore dismisses the [[Parallel postulate#Equivalent properties|different attempt]] by Ibn Haytham too.<ref name=rozenfeld-ch2>{{harv|Rozenfeld|1988|pp=64–65}}</ref> In a sense he made the first attempt at formulating a non-Euclidean postulate as an alternative to the parallel postulate,<ref name=katz>{{harv|Katz|1998|p=270}}.

In that his solution is not a direct path to a numerical solution and in fact his solutions are not [[number]]s but rather [[line segment]]s.

R. Amir-Moez, ''Khayyam's Solution of Cubic Equations'', Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 35, No. 5  (Nov., 1962), pp. 269-271. This paper contains an extension by the late [[Mohsen Hashtroodi]] of Khayyám's method to degree four equations.</ref>\n\nRegarding more general equations he states that the solution of cubic equations requires the use of [[conic sections]] and that it cannot be solved by ruler and compass methods.<ref name=amirmoez/> A proof of this impossibility was only plausible 750 years after Khayyám died. In this paper Khayyám mentions his will to prepare a paper giving full solution to cubic equations: \"If the opportunity arises and I can succeed, I shall give all these fourteen forms with all their branches and cases, and how to distinguish whatever is possible or impossible so that a paper, containing elements which are greatly useful in this art, will be prepared.\"<ref name=amirmoez/>\n\nThis refers to the book ''Treatise on Demonstrations of Problems of Algebra'' (1070), which laid down the principles of algebra, part of the body of Persian Mathematics that was eventually transmitted to Europe.<ref name=masterpieces96/> In particular, he derived general methods for solving cubic equations and even some higher orders.\n\n===Binomial theorem and extraction of roots===\n{{See also|Binomial theorem#History|l1=History of binomial theorem}}\n{{Quote box|quote=From the [[Indian mathematics|Indians]] one has methods for obtaining [[square root|square]] and [[cube root]]s, methods based on knowledge of individual cases—namely the knowledge of the squares of the nine digits 1<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 3<sup>2</sup> (etc.) and their respective products, i.e. 2 × 3 etc. We have written a treatise on the proof of the validity of those methods and that they satisfy the conditions.

Khayyám was the mathematician who noticed the importance of a general binomial theorem.

[[Saccheri]] himself based the whole of his long, heroic, and ultimately flawed proof of the parallel postulate around the quadrilateral and its three cases, proving many theorems about its properties along the way.\n\n==Astronomer==\n[[File:Jalaali_Leap_Year.svg|thumb|The Jalali calendar was introduced by Omar Khayyám alongside other Mathematicians and Astronomers in Nishapur, today it is one of the oldest calendars in the world as well as the most accurate solar calendar in use today.

According to some accounts, the version of the medieval Iranian calendar in which 2,820 [[solar year]]s together contain 1,029,983 days (or 683 leap years, for an average year length of 365.24219858156 days) was based on the measurements of Khayyám and his colleagues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ephemeris.com/history/middle-east.html#persian |title=Early History of Astronomy - The Middle East |publisher=Ephemeris.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref> Another proposal is that Khayyám's calendar simply contained eight leap days every thirty-three years (for a year length of 365.2424 days).<ref>''Mapping Time: The Calendar and its History'' by E.G.

It is the basis of the [[Iranian calendar]], which is followed today in Iran and Afghanistan. While the Jalali calendar is more accurate than the Gregorian, it is based on actual solar transit, similar to [[Hindu calendar]]s, and requires an [[ephemeris]] for calculating dates. The lengths of the months can vary between 29 and 31 days depending on the moment when the sun crosses into a new [[zodiac]]al area (an attribute common to most [[Hindu calendar]]s). This meant that seasonal errors were lower than in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe modern-day Iranian calendar standardizes the month lengths based on a reform from 1925, thus minimizing the effect of solar transits. Seasonal errors are somewhat higher than in the Jalali version, but leap years are calculated as before.\n\n==Poetry==\n{{Main|Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám}}\n[[File:005-a-Ruby-kindles-in-the-vine-810x1146.jpg|thumb|right|Omar Khayyám was a notable poet during the reign of the [[Seljuk]] ruler [[Malik-Shah I]] and his contributions to the developments of [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[philosophy]] inspired later generations.]]\n\nScholars believe he wrote about a thousand four-line verses or [[Ruba'i|rubaiyat]].

At one end of the spectrum, there are nightclubs named after Khayyám, and he is seen as an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] [[Hedonism|hedonist]].<ref>[[Sadegh Hedayat]] pointed out that Khayyám, \"from his youth to his death, remained a [[materialist]], pessimist, agnostic\". \"Khayyám looked at all religions' questions with a skeptical eye\", continues Hedayat, \"and hated the fanaticism, narrow-mindedness, and the spirit of vengeance of the mullahs, the so-called religious scholars\".</ref> On the other end of the spectrum, he is seen as a mystical [[Sufi]] Muslim poet with a complex set of ideals.\n\n;As a Skeptic\n\n[[File:Bucureşti - Omar Khayam 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Omar Khayyám in [[Bucharest]].]]\n\n[[Christopher Hitchens]], for instance, identifies Khayyám as a [[skeptic]], whose poetry was satirizing the claims and practices of religion.<ref>Hitchens, C. (2007). The portable atheist: Essential readings for the nonbeliever (p. 7). Philadelphia, PA: Da Capo.</ref>\n\n[[Sadegh Hedayat]] states in his introductory essay to his second edition of the ''Quatrains of the Philosopher Omar Khayyám'' that \"while Khayyám believes in the transmutation and transformation of the human body, he does not believe in a separate soul; if we are lucky, our bodily particles would be used in the making of a jug of wine\".<ref>Katouzian, H. (1991). Sadeq Hedayat: The life and literature of an Iranian writer (p. 138). London: I.B. Tauris</ref> He further maintains that Khayyam's meaning of \"wine\" is literal, and different from Sufi's usage of wine.\n\nFitzGerald, in his preface to the ''Rubáiyát'', also contested claims that Khayyám was a Sufi mystic:\n\n{{cquote|Omar's Epicurean Audacity of thought and Speech caused him to be regarded askance in his own time and country.

Bjerregaard has a similar take on the issue:\n{{quote|\"The writings of Omar Khayyam are good specimens of [[Sufism]], but are not valued in the West as they ought to be, and the mass of english-speaking people know him only through the poems of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]. It is unfortunate because Fitzgerald is not faithful to his master and model, and at times he lays words upon the tongue of the Sufi which are blasphemous. Such outrageous language is that of the eighty-first quatrain for instance. Fitzgerald is doubly guilty because he was more of a Sufi than he was willing to admit.\"<ref>C. H. A. Bjerregaard (1915). ''Sufism: Omar Khayyam and E. Fitzgerald''. The Sufi Publishing Society. Preface.</ref>}}\n\nA French orientalist named ''Franz Toussaint'', dissatisfied with Fitzgerald's translation wrote his own directly from the Persian text, claiming to express the spirit of the verses rather than to versify.<ref>http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Robaiyat</ref> His translation was published by ''Editions d'Art Henri Piazza''.\n\n[[Abdullah Isa Neil Dougan|Abdullah Dougan]], a modern [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufism|Sufi]], provides commentary<ref>Abdullah Dougan [http://www.gnosticpress.co.nz/ Who is the Potter?] Gnostic Press 1991 ISBN 0-473-01064-X</ref> on the role and contribution of Omar Khayyam to Sufi thought. Dougan says that while Omar is a minor Sufi teacher compared to the giants – [[Rumi]], [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]] and [[Sanai|Sana’i]] – one aspect that makes Omar’s work so relevant and accessible is its very human scale as we can feel for him and understand his approach. The argument over the quality of Fitzgerald’s translation of the Rubaiyat has, according to Dougan, diverted attention from a fuller understanding of the deeply esoteric message contained in Omar’s actual material – ''\"Every line of the Rubaiyat has more meaning than almost anything you could read in Sufi literature\"''.\n\n==Philosopher==\n[[File:Khayam.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Omar Khayyám mausoleum|Tomb of Omar Khayyám Neishapuri]] in [[Nishapur]], [[Iran]]]]\nKhayyám himself rejected any association with the title ''falsafī'' \"philosopher\" in the sense of Aristotelianism and stressed he wishes \"to know who I am\". In the context of philosophers he was labeled by some of his contemporaries as \"detached from divine blessings\".<ref name=chapter3>Bausani, A., Chapter 3 in [[#refchi5|Cambridge History of Iran (5)]], p. 289.</ref>\n\nIt is now established that Khayyám taught for decades the philosophy of Avicena, especially ''[[the Book of Healing]]'', in his home town Nishapur, till his death.<ref name=nasrkhayyamphil/> In an incident he had been requested to comment on a disagreement between Avicena and a philosopher called [[Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī]] who [[Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī#Kitab al-Mu'tabar|had criticized]] Avicena strongly. Khayyám is said to have answered \"[he] does not even understand the sense of the words of Avicenna, how can he oppose what he does not know?\"<ref name=chapter3/>\n\nKhayyám the philosopher could be understood from two rather distinct sources. One is through his [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]] and the other through his own works in light of the intellectual and social conditions of his time.<ref name=nkp01/> The latter could be informed by the evaluations of Khayyám's works by scholars and philosophers such as [[Abul-Fazl Bayhaqi]], [[Nizami Aruzi]], and [[al-Zamakhshari]] and Sufi poets and writers [[Attar of Nishapur]] and [[Najm-al-Din Razi]].\n\n===Mathematical philosophy===\nAs a mathematician, Khayyám has made fundamental contributions to the [[philosophy of mathematics]] especially in the context of [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Persian Mathematics]] and [[Persian philosophy]] with which most of the other Persian scientists and philosophers such as Avicenna, [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]] and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|Tusi]] are associated. There are at least three basic mathematical ideas of strong philosophical dimensions that can be associated with Khayyám.\n\n# Mathematical order: From where does this order issue, and why does it correspond to the world of nature? His answer is in one of his philosophical \"treatises on being\". Khayyám's answer is that \"the Divine Origin of all existence not only emanates ''[[wujud]]'' \"being\", by virtue of which all things gain reality, but It is the source of order that is inseparable from the very act of existence.\"<ref name=nkp01>[[#refNasr|S. H. Nasr]] Chapter 9, p . 170-1</ref>\n# The significance of [[axiom]]s in geometry and the necessity for the mathematician to rely upon philosophy and hence the importance of the relation of any particular science to prime philosophy. This is the philosophical background to Khayyám's total rejection of any attempt to \"prove\" the [[parallel postulate]], and in turn his refusal to bring motion into the attempt to prove this postulate, as had [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]], because Khayyám associated motion with the world of matter, and wanted to keep it away from the purely intelligible and immaterial world of geometry.<ref name=\"nkp01\"/>\n# Clear distinction made by Khayyám, on the basis of the work of earlier Persian philosophers such as Avicenna, between natural bodies and mathematical bodies. The first is defined as a body that is in the category of substance and that stands by itself, and hence a subject of [[natural sciences]], while the second, called \"[[volume]]\", is of the category of accidents (attributes) that do not subsist by themselves in the external world and hence is the concern of mathematics. Khayyám was very careful to respect the boundaries of each discipline, and criticized [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]] in his proof of the parallel postulate precisely because he had broken this rule and had brought a subject belonging to natural philosophy, that is, motion, which belongs to natural bodies, into the domain of geometry, which deals with mathematical bodies.<ref name=\"nkp01\"/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Ghafeleye Omr.svg|{{lang-fa|\"این قافلهٔ عُمر عجب میگذرد\"}} — A line of poetry by the Iranian poet Omar Khayyam in Shikasta Nastaʿlīq.\nFile:Chayyam guyand kasan behescht ba hur chosch ast small.png| A [[ruba'i]] of Omar Khayyam in Shikasta Nastaʿlīq.\n</gallery>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{prose|date=February 2015}}\n*A [[lunar crater]] ''[[Omar Khayyam (crater)|Omar Khayyam]]'' was named after him in 1970.\n*A [[minor planet]] called ''[[3095 Omarkhayyam]]'', discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Zhuravlyova]] in 1980, is named after him.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=ru&q=3094+Chukokkala |title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names - p.255 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1979-02-26 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref>\n*In June 2009 [[Iran]] donated a scholar pavilion to [[United Nations Office in Vienna]] which is placed in the central [[Memorial Plaza (Vienna)|Memorial Plaza]] of the [[Vienna International Center]].<ref>http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2009/unisvic167.html</ref> The [[Persian Scholars Pavilion]] at United Nations in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] is featuring the statues of four prominent Iranian figures.
