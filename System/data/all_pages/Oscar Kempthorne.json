Born in [[St Tudy]], [[Cornwall]] and educated in England, Kempthorne moved to the United States, where he was for many decades a professor at Iowa State University.\n\n==Randomization analysis==\n{{main|randomization test}}\n{{see also|permutation test}}\nKempthorne developed a randomization-based approach to the statistical analysis of randomized experiments, which was expounded in pioneering textbooks and articles. Kempthorne's insistence on randomization followed the early writings of [[Ronald Fisher]], especially on randomized experiments.<ref>[[Randomization]]-based inference and [[random assignment|randomized]] [[experiment]]s were introduced by [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Probability and statistics|Charles S. Peirce]], whose writings were recognized by Kempthorne (in later years). Kempthorne praised Peirce repeatedly in Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008), for example as being \"the foremost philosopher of science<!--, perhaps -->\" (page 8 in the first edition, 1994). Answering the question \"What do you see as the important problems of statistics?\", Kempthorne replied finally, \"I feel that much of philosophy needs to be read—particularly the writings of the great American philosopher, [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Probability and statistics|C. S. Peirce]].\" (Folks, p. 336)</ref>\n\nKempthorne is the founder of the \"Iowa school\" of [[experimental design]] and [[analysis of variance]].<ref>The \"Iowa school\" is named on page 262 in Bailey and Speed:\n* {{cite journal\n|doi=10.2307/1403405\n|title=Factorial Dispersion Models\n|author=[[Terry Speed|T. P. Speed]] and [[R. A. Bailey]]\n|journal=International Statistical Review / ''Revue Internationale de Statistique''\n|volume=55\n|issue=3\n|date=December 1987\n|pages=261–277\n|jstor=1403405\n}}\n</ref> Kempthorne and many of his former doctoral students have often emphasized the use of the randomization distribution under the [[null hypothesis]]. Kempthorne was skeptical of \"[[statistical model]]s\" (of  populations), when such models are proposed by statisticians rather than created using objective randomization procedures.\n\nKempthorne's randomization-analysis has influenced the [[Rubin causal model|causal model]] of [[Donald Rubin]]; in turn, Rubin's randomization-based analysis and his work with <!-- [[Paul Rosenbaum]] -->Rosenbaum on [[propensity score matching]] influenced Kempthorne's [[analysis of covariance]].<ref>See Chapter 8 in Hinkelmann and Kempthorne 2008.</ref>\n\n==Model-based analysis==\nOscar Kempthorne was skeptical towards (and often critical of) [[statistical model|model]]-based inference, particularly two influential alternatives: Kempthorne was skeptical of, first, neo-Fisherian statistics, which is inspired by the later writings of [[Ronald A. Fisher]] and by the contemporary writings of [[David R. Cox]] and [[John Nelder]]; neo-Fisherian statistics emphasizes [[likelihood function]]s of parameters.<ref>Kempthorne often distinguished between the randomization-based analysis of early Fisher and the model-based analysis of (post-Neyman) Fisher, for example in Kempthorne's comments on [[Debabrata Basu]]'s paper \"The Fisher randomization test\" in the ''Journal of the American Statistical Association'' (1978).</ref>\n\nSecond, Kempthorne was skeptical of [[Bayesian statistics]], which use not only likelihoods but also [[prior distribution|probability distribution]]s on parameters.<ref>However, Kempthorne recognized that the planning of experiments used scientific knowledge and beliefs, and therefore Kempthorne was interested in [[optimal design]]s, especially [[Bayesian experimental design]]:\n<blockquote>\nThe optimal design is dependent upon the unknown theta, and there is no choice but to invoke prior information about theta in choosing the design. I would like to say there has never been the slightest argument about this. In the design of experiments, one has to use some informal prior knowledge. (Folks, 334)\n</blockquote>\nKempthorne's skepticism towards [[Bayesian inference]] focused on the prior's use in analyzing data from randomized experiments; for analyzing data from randomized experiments, Kempthorne advocated using the objective randomization-distribution, which was induced by the randomization specified in the experimental protoocol and implemented in the actual experimental plan.\n</ref>\nNonetheless, while [[Bayesian probability|subjective probability]] and [[Bayesian inference]] were viewed skeptically by Kempthorne,  [[Bayesian experimental design]] was defended. In the preface to his second volume with Hinklemann (2004), Kempthorne wrote,\n<blockquote>\nWe strongly believe that design of experiment is a Bayesian experimentation process, . . .  <!-- ''not'' a Bayesian inference process, but --> one in which the experimenter approaches the experiment with some beliefs, to which he accommodates the design. (xxii)\n</blockquote>\n\n==Appointments==\nKempthorne served as professor of statistics at [[Iowa State University]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book\n|last=Kempthorne|first=Oscar |year=1979|title=The Design and Analysis of Experiments | edition=Corrected reprint of (1952) Wiley | publisher=Robert E.
