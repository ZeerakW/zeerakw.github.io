From 1925 until 1928 he went on a three-year fellowship financed by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. After his return in 1928 he became a professor in economics at the University of Vienna until his visit to Princeton University in 1938. In 1935 Morgenstern published the article Perfect Foresight and Economic Equilibrium, after which his colleague, [[Eduard Čech]], pointed him to an article of John von Neumann, '' Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele''(1928). During Morgenstern's visit to [[Princeton University]], [[Adolf Hitler]] took over Vienna through the [[Anschluss|Anschluss Österreichs]] and Morgenstern decided to remain in the United States. He became a member of the faculty at Princeton but gravitated toward the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. There, he met the mathematician [[John von Neumann]] and they collaborated to write ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'', published in 1944, which is recognized as the first book on game theory.  Game Theory is a mathematical framework for the study of strategic structures which govern rational decision-making in certain economic, political and military situations.\n\nThe collaboration between economist Morgenstern and mathematician von Neumann led to the birth of entirely new areas of investigation in both mathematics and economics. These have  attracted widespread academic and practical interest since that time.  In 1944 Morgenstern also became a United States citizen, and four years later he married Dorothy Young. Morgenstern remained at Princeton as a professor of economics until his retirement in 1970, at which time he joined the faculty of [[New York University]]. Morgenstern wrote many other articles and books, including ''On the Accuracy of Economic Observations'', and ''Predictability of Stock Market Prices'' with subsequent Nobel laureate Clive Granger.\n\nMorgenstern died in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] in 1977.  The archive of his published works and unpublished documents is held at [[Duke University]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oskar Morgenstern Archive|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/morgenst/|website=Duke University Library|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book | last1=Morgenstern | first1=Oskar |title=On the accuracy of economic observations | publisher=Princeton University Press| year=1950, 2nd rev. ed. 1963| location=Princeton, New Jersey | pages=xiv+322 | url=}}\n* {{cite book | last1=Morgenstern | first1=Oskar |  last2=Granger| first2=Clive W.
