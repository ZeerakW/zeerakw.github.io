He also excelled at, and wrote about, other games including [[backgammon]], [[gin rummy]], and [[poker]]. He was from [[Dallas, Texas]].<ref name=OEB>{{OEB|5|654–55}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn in [[Brooklyn]], he was taught to play [[whist]] at the age of six and played his first bridge at ten.<ref name=\"JJ\">{{cite book |last = Jacoby |first = James |authorlink = |title = Jacoby on Bridge |edition =  |publisher = Pharos Books |location = New York |pages = Preface |series =  |year = 1987 |doi =\n|lccn = 87060160 |oclc = |isbn = 0-88687-305-3}}</ref> During World War I, he joined the army at 15 by lying about his age but spent most of his time there playing [[poker]]. [[Dropping out]] of [[Columbia University]] as a math major<ref name=JJ/> to become an [[actuary]], he became the youngest person ever to pass the examination of the [[Society of Actuaries]] at the age of 21.  Having an exceptional aptitude for mathematics, Jacoby could multiply three and four digit numbers in his head without benefit of paper.<ref name=\"BW\">{{cite book |last = Wolff |first = Bobby |authorlink = Bobby Wolff |title = The Lone Wolff |edition =  |publisher = Master Point Press |location = Toronto |pages = 16–17 |series =  |year = 2008 |isbn = 978-1-897106-37-2}}</ref> During World War II and the [[Korean War]], he applied these abilities to [[counterintelligence]] and [[cryptanalysis]] being referred to as a human computer;<ref name=JJ/> later, he lectured on probability at [[M.I.T.]] and wrote books on mathematics.  However, his passion and lifelong focus was games, especially bridge.\n\n==Bridge career==\n\nBy the end of the twenties, Jacoby had achieved fame as a player at both [[Auction bridge|auction]] and contract bridge, further gaining international recognition when chosen by [[Sidney Lenz]] to be his partner in the famous [[Ely Culbertson#Culbertson-Lenz match|Culbertson–Lenz match]] of 1931. Jacoby's more aggressive bidding style confused Lenz and Jacoby withdrew after Lenz's criticism. Years later the analyst [[Terence Reese]] wrote, \"That the Culbertsons did not win more easily&nbsp;... was due to the fact that Jacoby was a player of quite different class from any of the others\".<ref>Reese, Terence, \"The bridge battle of the century\". ''British Bridge World'', August 1963, pp. 38-43. The rest of the match was described in subsequent issues.</ref> Jacoby subsequently solidified his position as the most successful tournament player in the thirties<ref name=JJ/> as a member of the famous \"[[P.&nbsp;Hal Sims|Four Horsemen]]\" from 1931 to 1933 and the \"[[Four Aces (bridge)|Four Aces]]\" from 1933 to 1941, dominating tournament play.<ref>{{OEB|6|165}}</ref> He is recognized by the [[American Contract Bridge League]] (ACBL) as Life Master #2, one of ten named in 1936.{{efn|name=LM}} LM&nbsp;#1 is [[David Burnstine]], his partner on the Four Horsemen and co-founder of the Four Aces.\n\nHe pionereed many bidding ideas, including the [[Jacoby transfer]] and [[Jacoby 2NT]] bids. Throughout his career, he also worked as a bridge columnist; a prolific writer, he wrote over 10,000 newspaper articles on bridge, and his many books include not only bridge but volumes on [[poker]], [[gin rummy]], [[canasta]], and the mathematics of card games and gambling, which he played at high stakes.<ref name=BW/>  He also released a record titled ''How to Win at Championship Bridge''.{{full|date=December 2014}}\n\nJacoby captained the North American and US teams that won the [[Bermuda Bowl]] in both 1970 and 1971. During a long playing career, he won tournaments with many partners including his son and co-author, [[James Jacoby]] (1933–1991), as well as his wife of more than 50 years, Mary Zita Jacoby. Terminally ill,<ref name=JJ/> his final tournament victory came in a major event at the ACBL [[North American Bridge Championships]] late in 1983, as a member of the team-of four champions for the [[Reisinger]] trophy with [[Edgar Kaplan]], [[Norman Kay (bridge)|Norman Kay]], [[Bill Root (bridge)|Bill Root]] and [[Richard Pavlicek]]. In the same year, he was named Personality of the Year by the international bridge writers (Charles H. Goren Award).
