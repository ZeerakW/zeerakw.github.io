He proved the [[Jordan curve theorem]] in 1905;<ref>{{cite book|author=Mac Lane, Saunders|authorlink=Saunders Mac Lane|chapter=Oswald Veblen ''June 24, 1880—August 10, 1960''|title=Biographical Memoirs of the Natl Acad Sci U S A|year=1964|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/veblen-oswald.pdf}}</ref> while this was long considered the first rigorous proof, many now also consider [[Camille Jordan|Jordan's]] original proof rigorous.\n\n==Life==\nVeblen was born in [[Decorah, Iowa]].  He went to school in [[Iowa City]]. He did his undergraduate studies at the [[University of Iowa]], where he received an  A.B. in 1898, and [[Harvard University]], where he was awarded a second B.A. in 1900.  For his graduate studies, he went to study mathematics at the [[University of Chicago]], where he obtained a Ph.D. in 1903.  His dissertation, ''A System of Axioms for Geometry'' was written under the supervision of [[E. H. Moore]]. \n\nVeblen taught mathematics at [[Princeton University]] from 1905 to 1932.  In 1926, he was named [[Henry Burchard Fine|Henry B. Fine]] Professor of Mathematics.   In 1932, he helped organize the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, resigning his professorship to become the first professor at the Institute that same year. He kept his professorship at the Institute until he was made emeritus in 1950. \n\nDuring his years in Princeton, Veblen and his wife Elizabeth accumulated land along the [[Rocky Hill Ridge|Princeton Ridge]].  In 1957 they donated {{convert|82|acre}} to establish the [[Herrontown Woods Arboretum]], one of the largest nature preserves in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Large Tract Donated|url=http://papersofprinceton.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&d=TownTopics19570728-01.2.4&srpos=6&e=-------en-20--1-byDA-txt-IN-Arboretum----#|accessdate=19 April 2014|newspaper=The Town Topics|date=28 July 1957}}</ref>\n\nVeblen died in [[Brooklin, Maine]], in 1960 at age 80. After his death the [[American Mathematical Society]] created an award in his name, called the [[Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry]]. It is awarded every three years, and is the most prestigious award in recognition of outstanding research in geometry.\n\n==Accomplishments==\nDuring his career, Veblen made important contributions in topology and in [[projective geometry|projective]] and [[differential geometry|differential]] geometries, including results important in [[modern physics]]. He introduced the Veblen axioms for projective geometry and proved the [[Veblen–Young theorem]]. He introduced the [[Veblen function]]s of ordinals and used an extension of them to define the small and large [[Large countable ordinal|Veblen ordinals]]. In [[World War II]] he was involved in overseeing ballistics work at the [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]] that involved early modern [[computing machine]]s, in particular supporting the proposal for  creation of the pioneering [[ENIAC]] electronic [[digital computer]].<ref>Mac Lane (1964), pg 333.</ref><ref>[http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=148 \"ARL Computing History\"]</ref><ref>[http://ftp.arl.army.mil/~mike/comphist/hist.html \"The History of Computing at BRL\"], [Mike Muuss]</ref> He also published a paper in 1912 on the [[four-color conjecture]].\n\n==Family==\nVeblen's uncle was [[Thorstein Veblen]], noted economist and sociologist. Oswald Veblen's parents were Andrew Anderson Veblen and Kirsti Hougen.\n\n==Books by O.
