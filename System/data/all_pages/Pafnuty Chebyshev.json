His name can be alternatively [[Romanization of Russian|transliterated]] as ''Chebychev'', ''Chebysheff'', ''Chebyshov''; or ''Tchebychev'', ''Tchebycheff'' (French transcriptions); or ''Tschebyschev'', ''Tschebyschef'',  ''Tschebyscheff'' (German transcriptions).\n\n== Biography ==\nOne of nine children, Chebyshev was born in the central [[Russia]]n village of [[Zhukovsky District, Kaluga Oblast|Akatovo]] near [[Borovsk]], to Agrafena Ivanova Pozniakova and Lev Pavlovich Chebyshev. His father had fought as an officer against [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s invading army.\n\nChebyshev was originally home schooled by his mother and his cousin, Avdotia Kvintillianova Soukhareva. He learned [[French language|French]] early in life, which later helped him communicate with other mathematicians. A stunted leg prevented him from playing with other children, leading him to concentrate on his studies instead.\n\nChebyshev studied at the college level at [[Moscow University]], where he earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in 1841. At Moscow University, Chebyshev was a graduate student of [[Nikolai Brashman]].\n\nAfter Chebyshev became a [[professor]] of mathematics in Moscow himself, his two most illustrious graduate students were [[Andrei Andreyevich Markov]] (the elder) and [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]].\n\nLater he moved to St. Petersburg, where he founded one of the most important schools of mathematics in Russia, and there is today a research institute in mathematics called the Chebyshev Laboratory in that city.\n\n== Mathematical contributions ==\nChebyshev is known for his work in the fields of [[probability]], [[statistics]], [[mechanics]], and [[number theory]]. The [[Chebyshev inequality]] states that if <math>X</math> is a [[random variable]] with [[standard deviation]] ''σ'' > 0, then the probability that the outcome of <math>X</math> is no less than <math>a\\sigma</math> away from its mean is no more than <math>1/a^2</math>:\n\n: <math>\\Pr(|X - {\\mathbf E}(X)| \\ge a\\,\\sigma )\\le \\frac {1}{a^2}.</math>\n\nThe Chebyshev inequality is used to prove the [[Law of large numbers#Weak law|Weak Law of Large Numbers]].\n\nThe [[Bertrand's postulate|Bertrand–Chebyshev theorem]] (1845,1852) states that for any <math>n > 1</math>, there exists a [[prime numbers|prime number]] <math>p</math> such that <math>n < p < 2n</math>. This is a consequence of the Chebyshev inequalities for the number <math>\\pi(n)</math> of [[prime numbers]] less than <math>n</math>, which state that <math>\\pi(n)</math> is of the order of <math>n/\\log(n)</math>. A more precise form is given by the celebrated [[prime number theorem]]: the ''quotient'' of the two expressions approaches 1.0 as <math>n</math> tends to infinity.\n\nChebyshev is also known for the [[Chebyshev polynomial]]s and the [[Chebyshev bias]] – the difference between the number of primes that are 3 (modulo 4) and 1 (modulo 4).\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[Image:Stamp of USSR 1047.jpg|thumb|right|Pafnuty Chebyshev on a stamp of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1946.]]\nChebyshev is considered to be a founding father of [[Russia]]n mathematics. Among his well-known students were the mathematicians [[Dmitry Grave]], [[Aleksandr Korkin]], [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]], and [[Andrey Markov|Andrei Markov]]. According to the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]], Chebyshev has 10,629 mathematical \"descendants\" as of 2015.<ref>{{MathGenealogy|12542}}</ref>\n\nThe lunar crater [[Chebyshev (crater)|Chebyshev]] and the [[asteroid]] [[2010 Chebyshev]] were named in his honour.\n\n== Publications ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Tchebychef | first1=P.
