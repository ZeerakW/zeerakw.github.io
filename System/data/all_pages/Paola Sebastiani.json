Her most important contribution is a model based on a [[Bayesian network]] that integrates more than 60 [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) and other [[biomarker]]s to compute the risk for stroke in patients with [[sickle cell anemia]]. This model was shown to have high sensitivity and specificity and demonstrated, for the first time, how an accurate risk prediction model of a complex genetic trait that is modulated by several interacting genes can be built using Bayesian networks.<ref name=\"pmid15778708\">{{cite journal | author = Sebastiani P, Ramoni MF, Nolan V, Baldwin CT, Steinberg MH | title = Genetic dissection and prognostic modeling of overt stroke in sickle cell anemia | journal = [[Nature Genetics]] | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 435–40 |date=April 2005 | pmid = 15778708 | pmc = 2896308 | doi = 10.1038/ng1533 | accessdate = 2009-02-03}}</ref>\n\nSebastiani obtained a first degree in [[Mathematics]] from the [[University of Perugia]], Italy (1987), an [[M.Sc.]] in [[Statistics]] from [[University College London]] (1990), and a [[Ph.D.]] in Statistics from the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] (1992).
