The concept of [[Du Val singularity]] of an [[algebraic surface]] is named after him. \n\n==Early life==\nDu Val was born in [[Cheadle Hulme]], [[Cheshire]]. He was the son of a [[cabinet maker]], but his parents' marriage broke up. As a child, he suffered ill-health, in particular [[asthma]], and was educated mostly by his mother. He was awarded a first class honours degree from the [[University of London External Programme]] in 1926, which he took by correspondence course.\n\nHe was a talented linguist, for example teaching himself [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] so that he might read [[Peer Gynt]]. He also had a strong interest in history but his love of mathematics led him to pursue that as a career.  His earliest publications show a leaning towards applied mathematics. \n\nHis mother moved to a village near [[Cambridge]] and he became acquainted with [[H. F. Baker|Henry Baker]], [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry]]. Baker turned his interest towards [[algebraic geometry]], and he entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1927.\n\n==Research in geometry==\nDu Val's early work before becoming a research student was on relativity, including a paper on the [[De Sitter space|De Sitter model]] of the universe and [[Grassmann]]'s tensor calculus.  His doctorate was on algebraic geometry and in his thesis he generalised a result of [[Pieter Hendrik Schoute|Schoute]]. He worked on [[algebraic surfaces]] and later in his career became interested in [[elliptic functions]].\n\nHe received his [[Ph.D.]] with a thesis entitled 'On Certain Configurations of Algebraic Geometry Having Groups of Self-Transformations Representable by Symmetry Groups of Certain Polygons' under Baker's supervision in 1930. While a research student he had many famous geometers including [[W. V. D. Hodge|Hodge]] as fellow research students,  and he formed a particular friendship with [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|Coxeter]] and [[John Greenlees Semple|Semple]].  He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1930 for four years. During that time he travelled extensively, visiting [[Rome]] and working with [[Federigo Enriques]], then in 1934 [[Princeton University]], where he attended lectures by [[James Waddell Alexander II|James W. Alexander]], [[Luther P. Eisenhart]], [[Solomon Lefschetz]], [[Oswald Veblen]], [[Joseph Wedderburn]], and [[Hermann Weyl]]. \n\nIn 1936, Du Val took up an assistant lectureship in the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Mathematics Department]] at [[Manchester]], where he stayed for five years.  He was then funded by a [[British Council]] scheme to go to [[Istanbul University]] as a professor of pure mathematics. There he learnt [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and even wrote a book on coordinate geometry in that language.\n\nAfter a spell in the [[United States]] at the [[University of Georgia]], he returned to the [[United Kingdom]], first taking up a post in [[Bristol]], then at the [[University College London]] in 1954, where he remained until he retired in 1970. Together with Semple he led the London Geometry Seminar during the time he spent in London.\n\nPatrick Du Val had three children Nicholas, Paula and Belinda and 10 grandchildren. His oldest daughter is also a PhD and is married to the current Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the university of Wales Lampeter.\n\n==Later life==\nAfter retirement, Du Val returned to Istanbul.  For three years he held the same post as before, and then as if reversing history, settled down to a retirement in Cambridge.\n\nHe is remembered as an interesting character. For example, in Manchester during the war he was remembered as a cloaked figure striding the parapets, as he carried out his duties as a fire warden. He was also known for startling the travelling public by carrying around a large string bag filled with garishly coloured [[Great icosahedron|stellated icosahedra]].\n\n==Work==\n*{{citation|first= Patrick|last= Du Val|title=On isolated singularities of surfaces which do not affect the conditions of adjunction.
