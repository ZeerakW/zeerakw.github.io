Awards and other earnings were generally [[philanthropist|donated]] to people in need and various worthy causes. He spent most of his life as a [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]], traveling between scientific conferences, universities and the homes of colleagues all over the world. He earned enough in stipends from universities as a guest lecturer, and from various mathematical awards to fund his travels and basic needs; money left over he used to fund cash prizes for proofs of \"Erdős problems\" (see below). He would typically show up at a colleague's doorstep and announce \"my brain is open\", staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later.

In 1938, he accepted his first American position as a scholarship holder at [[Princeton University]]. At this time, he began to develop the habit of traveling from campus to campus. He would not stay long in one place and traveled back and forth among mathematical institutions until his death.\n\nIn 1952, the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] denied Erdős, a Hungarian citizen, a re-entry visa into the United States, for reasons that have never been fully explained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Erdos.html |title=Erdos biography |accessdate=2008-11-11 |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland|date=January 2000}}</ref> Teaching at the [[University of Notre Dame]] at the time, Erdős could have chosen to remain in the country.

Although Hungary limited the freedom of its own citizens to enter and exit the country, it gave Erdős the exclusive privilege of being allowed to enter and exit the country as he pleased in 1956.\n\nThe U.S. Immigration Services later on granted a visa in 1963 to Erdős and he resumed including American universities in his teaching and travels.

He became a member of the scientific academies of eight countries, including the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the UK [[Royal Society]].

''American Scientist'', Volume 88, No. 6 November–December 2000</ref> Erdős never won the highest mathematical prize, the [[Fields Medal]], nor did he coauthor a paper with anyone who did,<ref>[http://www.oakland.edu/enp/erdpaths/ Paths to Erdös — The Erdös Number Project]</ref> a pattern that extends to other prizes.<ref>From [http://www.oakland.edu/upload/docs/Erdos%20Number%20Project/trails.pdf \"trails to Erdos\"], by DeCastro and Grossman, in ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'', vol. 21, no. 3 (Summer 1999), 51–63: A careful reading of Table 3 shows that although Erdos never wrote jointly with any of the 42 <nowiki>[</nowiki>Fields<nowiki>]</nowiki> medalists (a fact perhaps worthy of further contemplation)... there are many other important international awards for mathematicians. Perhaps the three most renowned...are the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics, and the Leroy P. Steele Prizes. ... Again, one may wonder why KAPLANSKY is the only recipient of any of these prizes who collaborated with Paul Erdös. (After this paper was written, collaborator Lovász received the Wolf prize, making 2 in all).</ref> He did win the [[Wolf Prize]], where his contribution is described as \"for his numerous contributions to [[number theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[probability]], [[set theory]] and [[mathematical analysis]], and for personally stimulating mathematicians the world over\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolffund.org.il/cat.asp?id=23&cat_title=MATHEMATICS |title=Wolf Foundation Mathematics Prize Page |publisher=Wolffund.org.il |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref> In contrast, the works of the three winners after were recognized as \"outstanding\", \"classic\", and \"profound\", and the three before as \"fundamental\" or \"seminal\".\n\nOf his contributions, the development of [[Ramsey theory]] and the application of the [[probabilistic method]] especially stand out. [[Extremal combinatorics]] owes to him a whole approach, derived in part from the tradition of [[analytic number theory]]. Erdős found a proof for [[Bertrand's postulate]] which proved to be far neater than [[Chebyshev]]'s original one. He also discovered the first [[elementary proof]] for the [[prime number theorem]], along with [[Atle Selberg]]. However, the circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between Erdős and Selberg.<ref name=goldfeld>{{Cite journal | last = Goldfeld | first = Dorian | year = 2003 | title = The Elementary Proof of the Prime Number Theorem: an Historical Perspective | journal = Number Theory: New York Seminar | pages = 179–192}}</ref><ref name=interview>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2008-45-04/S0273-0979-08-01223-8/S0273-0979-08-01223-8.pdf |first=Nils A.|last= Baas|first2= Christian F.|last2= Skau |journal= Bull.

There are thought to be at least a thousand such unpaid payments, though there is no official or comprehensive list. The offers remain active despite Erdős's death; [[Ronald Graham]] is the (informal) administrator of solutions. The solvers can get either the original check signed by Erdős before his death (for memento only, cannot be cashed) or a cashable check from Graham.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Erdös's Hard-to-Win Prizes Still Draw Bounty Hunters |author=Charles Seife |journal=Science |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci%3B296/5565/39 |doi=10.1126/science.296.5565.39 |date=5 April 2002 |volume=296 |pmid=11935003 |issue=5565 |pages=39–40}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most mathematically notable of these problems is the [[Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions]]:\n:If the sum of the reciprocals of a sequence of integers diverges, then the sequence contains [[arithmetic progression]]s of arbitrary length.\nIf true, it would solve several other open problems in number theory (although one main implication of the conjecture, that the [[prime number]]s contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, has since been proved independently as the [[Green–Tao theorem]]). The payment for the solution of the problem is currently worth US$5000.<ref>p. 354, Soifer, Alexander (2008); ''The Mathematical Coloring Book: Mathematics of Coloring and the Colorful Life of its Creators''; New York: Springer.

An Erdős number describes a person's degree of separation from Erdős himself, based on their collaboration with him, or with another who has their own Erdős number. Erdős alone was assigned the Erdős number of 0 (for being himself), while his immediate collaborators could claim an Erdős number of 1, their collaborators have Erdős number at most 2, and so on.
