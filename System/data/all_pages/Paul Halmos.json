He was also recognized as a great mathematical expositor.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHalmos arrived in the U.S. at 13 years of age, but never lost his Hungarian accent.  Halmos obtained his B.A. from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], majoring in mathematics, but fulfilling the requirements for both a math and philosophy degree.  He took only three years to obtain the degree, and was only 19 when he graduated. He then began a Ph.D. in philosophy; but, after failing his masters' oral exams,<ref>The Legend of John Von Neumann. P. R. Halmos. The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 80, No. 4. (Apr., 1973), pp.&nbsp;382–394.</ref> he shifted to mathematics, graduating in 1938. [[Joseph L. Doob]] supervised his dissertation, titled ''Invariants of Certain Stochastic Transformations: The Mathematical Theory of Gambling Systems''.\n\n==Career==\nShortly after his graduation, Halmos left for the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], lacking both job and grant money. Six months later, he was working under [[John von Neumann]], which proved a decisive experience. While at the Institute, Halmos wrote his first book, ''Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces'', which immediately established his reputation as a fine expositor of mathematics.\n\nHalmos taught at [[Syracuse University]], the [[University of Chicago]] (1946–60), the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] (1976–78), the [[University of Hawaii]], and [[Indiana University]].  From his 1985 retirement from Indiana until his death, he was affiliated with the Mathematics department at [[Santa Clara University]].\n\n==Accomplishments==\nIn a series of papers reprinted in his 1962 ''Algebraic Logic'', Halmos devised [[polyadic algebra]]s, an algebraic version of [[first-order logic]] differing from the better known [[cylindric algebra]]s of [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students.  An elementary version of polyadic algebra is described in [[monadic Boolean algebra]].\n\nIn addition to his original contributions to mathematics, Halmos was an unusually clear and engaging expositor of university mathematics. He won the [[Lester R. Ford Award]] in 1971<ref>{{cite journal|author=Halmos, Paul R.|title=Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces|journal=Amer. Math.

In 1983, he received the AMS's Steele Prize for exposition.\n\nIn the ''American Scientist'' 56(4): 375–389, Halmos argued that mathematics is a creative art, and that mathematicians should be seen as artists, not number crunchers. He discussed the division of the field into mathology and mathophysics, further arguing that mathematicians and painters think and work in related ways.\n\nHalmos's 1985 \"automathography\" ''I Want to Be a Mathematician'' is an account of what it was like to be an academic mathematician in 20th century America.  He called the book \"automathography\" rather than \"autobiography\", because its focus is almost entirely on his life as a mathematician, not his personal life.  The book contains the following quote on Halmos' view of what doing mathematics means:\n\n{{quote|Don't just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?}}\n{{quote box\n|align=right\n|width=33%\n|quote=What does it take to be [a mathematician]? I think I know the answer: you have to be born right, you must continually strive to become perfect, you must love mathematics more than anything else, you must work at it hard and without stop, and you must never give up.\n|source=Paul Halmos, 1985\n}}\nIn these memoirs, Halmos claims to have invented the \"iff\" notation for the words \"[[if and only if]]\" and to have been the first to use the [[tombstone (typography)|“tombstone”]] notation to signify the [[Q.E.D.|end of a proof]],<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Halmos\n | first = Paul\n | authorlink = \n | year = 1950\n | title = Measure Theory\n | publisher = Van Nostrand\n | location = New York\n | quote = The symbol ∎ is used throughout the entire book in place of such phrases as \"Q.E.D.\" or \"This completes the proof of the theorem\" to signal the end of a proof.\n | pages = vi\n}}</ref> and this is generally agreed to be the case.  The tombstone symbol {{Unicode|∎}} ([[Unicode]] U+220E) is sometimes called a ''halmos''.<ref>\"The symbol is definitely not my invention&nbsp;— it appeared in popular magazines (not mathematical ones) before I adopted it, but, once again, I seem to have introduced it into mathematics. It is the symbol that sometimes looks like ▯, and is used to indicate an end, usually the end of a proof. It is most frequently called the 'tombstone', but at least one generous author referred to it as the 'halmos'.\", Halmos (1985) p. 403.</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Halmos and his wife Virginia funded the [[Euler Book Prize]], an annual award given by the [[Mathematical Association of America]] for a book that is likely to improve the view of mathematics among the public. The first prize was given in 2007, the 300th anniversary of [[Leonhard Euler]]'s birth, to [[John Derbyshire]] for his book about [[Bernhard Riemann]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]: [[Prime Obsession]].<ref name=\"maa\">[http://www.maa.org/awards/eulerbook.html The Mathematical Association of America's Euler Book Prize], retrieved 2011-02-01.</ref>\n\n==Books by Halmos==\n*1942.
