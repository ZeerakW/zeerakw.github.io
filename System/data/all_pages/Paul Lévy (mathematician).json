[[Lévy process]]es, [[Lévy measure]]s, [[Lévy's constant]], the [[Lévy distribution]], the [[Lévy skew alpha-stable distribution]], the [[Lévy area]], the [[Lévy arcsine law]], and the [[non-fractal]] [[Lévy C curve]] are also named after him.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nLévy was born in [[Paris]], the son of Lucien Lévy, an examiner at the [[École Polytechnique]]. Lévy also attended the École Polytechnique and published his first paper in 1905, at the age of nineteen, while still an undergraduate.  His teacher and advisor was [[Jacques Hadamard]].  After graduation he spent a year in military service and then studied for three years at the [[École des Mines]], where he became a professor in 1913.<ref name=mactutor />\n\nDuring [[World War I]] Lévy conducted mathematical analysis work for the French Artillery. In 1920 he was appointed Professor of Analysis at the École Polytechnique, where his students included [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] and [[Georges Matheron]]. He remained at the École Polytechnique until his retirement in 1959, with a gap during World War II after his 1940 firing because of the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] [[Statute on Jews]].<ref name=mactutor />\n\nLévy received a number of honours, including membership at the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and honorary membership at the [[London Mathematical Society]].<ref name=mactutor />\n\nHis daughter [[Marie-Hélène Schwartz]] and son-in-law [[Laurent Schwartz]] were also notable mathematicians.<ref name=\"yks\">{{citation|title=Women mathematicians in France in the mid-twentieth century|first=Yvette|last=Kosmann-Schwarzbach|authorlink=Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach|doi=10.1080/17498430.2014.976804|journal=BSHM Bulletin: Journal of the British Society for the History of Mathematics|year=2015|arxiv=1502.07597}}.</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n\n* 1922 – ''Lecons d'analyse Fonctionnelle''\n* 1925 – ''Calcul des probabilités''\n* 1937 – ''Théorie de l'addition des variables aléatoires''\n* 1948 – ''Processus stochastiques et mouvement brownien''\n* 1954 – ''Le mouvement brownien''\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Lévy metric]]\n* [[Lévy's modulus of continuity]]\n* [[Lévy–Prokhorov metric]]\n* [[Lévy's continuity theorem]]\n* [[Lévy's zero-one law]]\n* [[Concentration of measure]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Rama Cont:  [http://www.proba.jussieu.fr/pageperso/ramacont/levy.html  Paul Lévy: a biography]\n* Gérard P.
