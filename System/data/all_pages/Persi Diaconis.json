MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Fellowship]] in 1982. In 1992 he published (with [[Dave Bayer]]) a paper entitled ''\"Trailing the Dovetail Shuffle to Its Lair\"''<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bayer | first1 = Dave | author1-link=Dave Bayer | last2 = Diaconis | first2 = Persi | author2-link=Persi Diaconis | doi = 10.1214/aoap/1177005705 | title = Trailing the Dovetail Shuffle to its Lair | journal = The Annals of Applied Probability | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 295–313 | year = 1992 | url = http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoap/1177005705| ref = harv}}</ref> (a term coined by magician [[Charles Jordan (magician)|Charles Jordan]] in the early 1900s) which established rigorous results on how many times a deck of playing cards must be [[Shuffle#Riffle|riffle shuffled]] before it can be considered random according to the mathematical measure [[Total variation distance of probability measures|total variation distance]].  Diaconis is often cited for the simplified proposition that it takes seven shuffles to randomize a deck.  More precisely, Diaconis showed that, in the [[Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model]] of how likely it is that a riffle results in a particular [[riffle shuffle permutation]], it takes 5 riffles before the total variation distance of a 52-card deck begins to drop significantly from the maximum value of 1.0, and 7 riffles before it drops below 0.5 very quickly (a threshold phenomenon), after which it is reduced by a factor of 2 every shuffle. Interestingly, when [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] is viewed as the probabilistic distance, riffle shuffling seems to take less time to mix, and the threshold phenomenon goes away (because the entropy function is subadditive.).<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Trefethen | first1 = L.

Among other things, they showed that the separation distance of an ordered [[blackjack]] deck (that is, aces on top, followed by 2's, followed by 3's, etc.) drops below .5 after 7 shuffles.  Separation distance is an upper bound for variation distance.<ref name=science_news>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/38434/title/Shuffling_the_cards_Math_does_the_trick\n | title = Shuffling the cards: Math does the trick\n | date = November 7, 2008\n | accessdate = 14 November 2008\n | publisher = Science News\n | quote = Diaconis and his colleagues are issuing an update.
