He earned his Doctorate at the University of Oxford in 1976.\n\n==Biography==\nDr. Hall was born to [[radiophysics]] and [[radio astronomy]] pioneer [[Ruby Payne-Scott]] and telephone technician William Holman Hall. His younger sister is artistic photographer and sculptor, [[Fiona Margaret Hall]].\n\nHall is an author in probability and statistics. [[Mathscinet]] lists him with more than 500 publications as of January 2008. He has made contributions to nonparametric statistics, in particular for curve estimation and resampling: the bootstrap method, smoothing, density estimation, and bandwidth selection. He has worked on numerous applications across fields of economics, engineering, physical science and biological science. Hall has also made contributions to surface roughness measurement using fractals. In probability theory he has made many contributions to limit theory, spatial processes and [[stochastic geometry]]. His paper \"Theoretical comparison of bootstrap confidence intervals\" (Annals of Statistics, 1988) has been reprinted in the ''Breakthroughs in Statistics'' collection.\n\nProfessor Hall is currently an [[ARC Laureate Fellow]] at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, [[University of Melbourne]],<ref>http://www.arc.gov.au/media/fl11/pdf/Peter_Hall_bio.pdf</ref> and also has a joint appointment at [[University of California Davis]].<ref name=\"ucdavis\">{{cite web | title=UCDavis - History of the Department of Statistics |  url=http://anson.ucdavis.edu/about/history | accessdate= 4 March 2011}}</ref> He previously held a professorship at the [[Centre for Mathematics and its Applications]] at the [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Main Honours and Awards==\n* 2013 Foreign Associate, [[National Academy of Sciences]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/2013_04_30_NAS_Election.html|title=News from the National Academy of Sciences 2013|date= 30 April 2013}}</ref>\n* 2013 Officer of the Order of Australia<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.unimelb.edu.au/science-staff-and-alumni-receive-australia-day-honours|title=Science staff and alumni receive Australia Day honours 2013|date=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n* 2011 [[Guy Medal]] in Silver<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rssenews.org.uk/articles/20110602|title=Peter Hall accepts Guy Medal|publisher=[[Royal Statistical Society]]|work=RSSeNews|date=3 June 2011}}</ref>\n* 2010 [[George Szekeres Medal]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/News/news.php?news_id=80|title=George Szekeres Medal for 2010|date= 10 January 2010}}</ref>\n* 2007 [[Matthew Flinders Medal and Lecture]] <ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.science.org.au/awardees-2007#flinders|title=Awardees for 2007| publisher=Australian Academy of Science|accessdate=18 September 2015}} </ref>\n* 2000 [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] of London<ref>[[List of Fellows of the Royal Society G,H,I]]</ref>\n* 1996 Fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]]<ref>http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm</ref>\n* 1994 [[Hannan Medal]] of the [[Australian Academy of Science]]\n* 1989 [[COPSS Presidents' Award|Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies Award]]<ref>[[COPSS Presidents' Award]]</ref>\n* 1987 [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science]]<ref>http://www.sciencearchive.org.au/fellows/fellowship-list.html</ref>\n* 1986 [[Rollo Davidson Prize]], [[University of Cambridge]]<ref>[[Rollo Davidson Prize]]</ref>\n* 1986 [[Australian Mathematical Society Medal]]<ref>[[Australian Mathematical Society Medal]]</ref>\n* 1984 Fellow of [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]<ref>http://imstat.org/awards/honored_fellows.htm</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* P.
