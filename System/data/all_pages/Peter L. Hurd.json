Hurd''' is an academic specialising in [[biology]]. He is an Associate Professor aligned to the Department of Psychology's Biocognition Unit, and the University's Centre for Neuroscience at the [[University of Alberta]]. His research primarily focuses on the study of the evolution of aggressive behaviour, including investigation of aggression, communication and other [[social behaviour]] which takes place between animals with conflicting interests. Major tools for this research are [[mathematical modeling]] (principally [[game theory]] and [[genetic algorithms]]).\nHe is also interested in how the process of [[sexual differentiation]] produces individual differences in social behaviour.\n\nHurd conducted a study on [[digit ratio]]s suggesting a positive correlation in males between aggressive tendency and the ratio of the lengths of the ring finger to his index finger. These gathered significant media attention, being reported on the [[BBC]],<ref name=\"BBC\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4314209.stm Article on The BBC website] (Retrieved June 2007)</ref> in the ''[[New York Times]]'',<ref>Nicholas Bakalar, \"What else His Ring Finger Says\" the New York Times, D6 (2005)</ref> ''[[Discover Magazine]]'',<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/2005/jun/fingering-answers/ Discover magazine Article ]</ref> ''[[Scientific American Mind]]'',<ref>[http://www.sciammind.com/article.cfm?articleID=000AB7EF-6075-128A-9DD683414B7F0000 Scientific American Mind article]</ref> ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''<ref>[http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/mediasummaries.cfm?id=8285 Summary of National Geographic Article]</ref> and on [[Jay Leno]].<ref>[http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/newtrail/nav03.cfm?nav03=46926&nav02=46925&nav01=44986 Research Overview with Reference to Jay Leno]</ref>\n\n==Research==\n===Evolution of animal signalling===\nSome of Hurd's most cited papers deal with the evolution of mating displays, specifically the idea that [[sexual selection|sexually selected]] traits have evolved to exploit previously existing biases in the sensory, or recognition, systems of their receivers, rather than being handicapped displays<ref>Hurd PL, Wachtmeister C-A & Enquist M, 1995.

Hurd attributes the preponderance of handicap models in biology to the use of simple [[signalling games]] which are incapable of modelling conventional signalling.<ref>Hurd PL & Enquist M. 2005. A strategic taxonomy of biological communication. ''Animal Behaviour'' '''70''': 1155-1170.</ref>\n\n===Aggressiveness===\nHurd has classified models of fighting behaviour into those driven by: 1) fighting ability (aka [[resource holding potential]]), 2) perceived value of winning, and 3) aggressiveness and argues that if variation in the last trait -aggressiveness- exists in a biologically meaningful way, it ought to be fixed for life at an early stage of development.<ref>Hurd PL. 2006. Resource holding potential, subjective resource value, and game theoretical models of aggressiveness signalling. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' '''241''': 639-648.</ref>  Many studies on both human, and non-human, animals suggest that inter-individual variation in adult aggressiveness is largely organised by [[Testosterone#Virilizing_and_anabolic_effects_on_humans|prenatal exposure to androgens]].  [[Digit ratio]] (2D:4D, the ratio of index to ring finger length) is a widely used as a proxy measure for prenatal [[testosterone]] exposure.  Hurd demonstrated that men with more feminine typical-digit ratios showed lower aggressive tendency than males with more masculine-typical digit ratios.<ref>Bailey AA & Hurd PL, 2005. Finger length ratio predicts physical aggression in men but not women. ''[[Biological Psychology (journal)|Biological Psychology]]'' '''68''': 215-222</ref>\n\n===Digit ratio===\nAmong his other research into digit ratio, Hurd has demonstrated that, while there is no difference in digit ratio between the sexes in most laboratory mice, that pups which gested next to brothers have higher digit ratios than those whose uterine neighbours were sisters,<ref>Bailey AA, Wahlsten D & Hurd PL, 2005.

Neill]]'s [[Summerhill School]], Hurd was an enthusiastic member of a student run [[Anarchistic free school|free school]] group while unenthusiastically attending [[Colonel By Secondary School]].<ref>University of Alberta, Undergrad Psychology Association \"Professor of the Month\" interview, http://www.ualberta.ca/~upa/prof_hurd.htm</ref>  He then completed a [[BSc]] at [[Carleton University]], [[Canada]] in 1990, followed by an [[MSc]] in 1993 from [[Simon Fraser University]].  He moved to [[Sweden]] to undertake a [[PhD]] at [[Stockholm University]] (Awarded in 1997) before committing to an initial [[postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral fellowship]] with [[Mike Ryan (professor)|Mike Ryan]] at the [[University of Texas]].  Hurd then became a lecturer at the [[University of Texas]] in 2000 until 2001 when he moved to the [[University of Alberta]], [[Canada]] as an Assistant Professor. Hurd was promoted to Associate Professor in 2007.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aggression]]\n* [[Digit ratio]]\n* [[Signalling theory]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.psych.ualberta.ca/~phurd/ Pete Hurd homepage from the University of Alberta]\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Hurd, Peter L.\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Canadian biologist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     =\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hurd, Peter L.}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:University of Alberta faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Texas at Austin faculty]]\n[[Category:Carleton University alumni]]\n[[Category:Simon Fraser University alumni]]\n[[Category:Canadian biologists]]\n[[Category:Game theorists]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Peter L.
