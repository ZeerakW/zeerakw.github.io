This result states that [[cyclic polytope]]s have the maximum possible number of faces among all polytopes with a given dimension and number of vertices.<ref>{{citation|title=Lectures on Polytopes|volume=152|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first=Günter M.|last=Ziegler|authorlink=Günter M.

McMullen's proof is amazingly simple and elegant, combining to key tools: shellability and ''h''-vectors.}}</ref> McMullen also formulated the g-conjecture, later the [[g-theorem]] of Billera, Lee, and Stanley, characterizing the [[f-vector|''f''-vectors]] of [[simplicial sphere]]s.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Gruber | first = Peter M.\n | isbn = 978-3-540-71132-2\n | location = Berlin\n | mr = 2335496\n | page = 265\n | publisher = Springer\n | series = Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences]\n | title = Convex and discrete geometry\n | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=bSZKAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA265\n | volume = 336\n | year = 2007|quotation=The problem of characterizing the ''f''-vectors of onvex polytopes is ... far from a solution, but there are important contributions towards it.
