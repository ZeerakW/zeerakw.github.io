He is a leading proponent of [[Bayesian statistics]].\n\nHe was educated at the [[City of London School]], [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] and [[Darwin College, Cambridge]].\n\nHe was lecturer in statistics at University College London from 1969 to 1978.  He was then Professor of Statistics at The [[City University, London|City University]] until 1981, when he returned to UCL as a reader, becoming Pearson Professor of Statistics there in 1982. He moved to Cambridge University as Professor of Statistics in 2007, retiring in 2013.\n\nHe was elected a member of the [[International Statistical Institute]] in 1978, and a Chartered Statistician of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1993.  He was editor of [[Biometrika]] from 1992 to 1996 and President of the [[International Society for Bayesian Analysis]] in 2000.<ref>[http://www.bayesian.org/archives/pastofficers.html Past Officers, Board Members and Appointments of ISBA,] [[International Society for Bayesian Analysis]].
