Presently he is a Schwartz Senior Fellow at the [[New America Foundation]], and he formerly worked as a senior writer and deputy assistant managing editor at ''U.S. News & World Report''.\n\n==Personal life and education==\nThe son of Kenneth and Mary Longman, who worked in Baden-Württemberg as a result of the postwar occupation of that state by the US military, Phillip Longman spent most of his childhood in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He studied at [[Oberlin College]] and later obtained a Knight-Baghot fellowship at [[Columbia University]].\n\nPhillip Longman was originally married to Robin Longman, but after she died he married Sandy Garbrecht. They have one son, Sam, and reside in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n==Career==\nFocusing his attention on how demographic and social change interact and affect government finance, the environment, foreign policy, and the development of society generally, Longman published his first book, ''Born to Pay: The New Politics of Aging in America'' in 1987. In the following decade wrote many articles about the impact of aging populations on society in the future. During this period, his name became much more widely known in the academic community: his articles became published by such journals as ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]''.\n\nIn 1997 Longman published his second book ''The Return of Thrift: How the Collapse of the Middle Class Welfare State will Reawaken Values in America'', which argued that people today are spending in an unsustainable manner with the accelerating decline in [[Total Fertility Rate|fertility rates]] threatening the financial collapse of the [[welfare state]] throughout the world. By 2000 he had linked with the New America Foundation and began work on his most widely read work, ''The Empty Cradle'' in March 2004. This book expressed his strongly held opinion that [[sub-replacement fertility]] and resultant population decline is likely to have catastrophic economic consequences for those nations suffering from it and is also likely to reduce societies' ability to adjust to newly emerging problems because of unwillingness to innovate or take risks. It also examines the present effect of the rapid fall in birth rates around the globe.\n\nHis research into the history of demographic decline in ancient Greece and Rome led to an article titled ''The Return of Patriarchy'' in the March, 2006 issue of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', and in other journals in an edited form under the title ''The Liberal Baby Bust''. On January 1, 2007, his fourth full-length book was published by PoliPointPress. Titled ''Best Care Anywhere: Why VA Healthcare is Better Than Yours'', it reflects on Longman's loss of his first wife to cancer and aims to show that in fact private health insurance is not superior to public health care as is often presumed.\n\n==Awards==\nPhillip Longman has won numerous awards for his business and financial writing, including [[UCLA]]'s [[Gerald Loeb Award]], and the top prize for investigative journalism from Investigative Reporters and Editors.\n\n==Books==\n* ''Born to Pay: The New Politics of Aging in America (1987)''\n* ''The Return of Thrift: How the Collapse of the Middle Class Welfare State will Reawaken Values in America (1997)''\n* ''[[The Empty Cradle|The Empty Cradle: How Falling Birthrates Threaten World Prosperity and What To Do About It (2004)]]''\n* ''Best Care Anywhere: Why VA Healthcare is Better Than Yours (2007)''\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.newamerica.net/people/phillip_longman Phillip Longman's page at the New America Foundation]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Longman, Phillip\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American demographer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = April 21, 1956\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Longman, Phillip}}\n[[Category:American demographers]]\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American investigative journalists]]\n[[Category:Oberlin College alumni]]\n[[Category:Columbia University alumni]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Phillip Longman"}}}}
