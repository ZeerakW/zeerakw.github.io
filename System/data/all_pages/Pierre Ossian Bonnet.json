He made some important contributions to the [[differential geometry]] of surfaces, including the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nPierre Bonnet attended the Collège in Montpellier.  In 1838 he entered the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris.  He also studied at the [[École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées]].\n\n===Middle years===\nIn graduating he was offered a post as an engineer. After some thought Bonnet decided on a career in teaching and research in mathematics instead.\n\nTurning down the engineering post had not been an easy decision since Bonnet was not well off financially. He had to do private tutoring so that he could afford to accept a position at the Ecole Polytechnique in 1844.\n\nOne year before this, in 1843, Bonnet had written a paper on the convergence of series with positive terms. Another paper on series in 1849 was to earn him an award from the Brussels Academy. However between these two papers on series, Bonnet had begun his work on differential geometry in 1844.\n\nBonnet was elected to the Academy of Sciences in 1862 to replace [[Jean Baptiste Biot|Biot]]. He defeated Bour for this position. From 1868 Bonnet assisted [[Michel Chasles|Chasles]] at the Ecole Polytechnique, and three years later he became a director of studies there. In addition to this post he also taught at the Ecole Normale Supérieure.\n\nIn 1878 Bonnet succeeded [[Le Verrier]] to the chair at the Sorbonne, then in 1883 he succeeded [[Liouville]] as a member of the Bureau des Longitudes.\n\nBonnet did important work on differential geometry. In addition [[Serret]], [[Jean Frédéric Frenet|Frenet]], [[Joseph Louis François Bertrand|Bertrand]] and [[Pierre Puiseux|Puiseux]] worked in France on this topic. Bonnet made major contributions introducing the notion of geodesic curvature. A formula for the line integral of the geodesic curvature along a closed curve is known as the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] published a special case.\n\nIndependently of [[Ferdinand Minding]], Bonnet showed the invariance of the geodesic curvature under bending. Between 1844 and 1867 he published a series of papers on the differential geometry of surfaces. In 1859 he submitted an important memoir for the Grand Prize of the Paris Academy. The prize was  to find all surfaces of a given linear element.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Topics named after Carl Friedrich Gauss]]\n\n==References==\n*{{MacTutor|id=Bonnet|name=Pierre Ossian Bonnet}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=153020}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Bonnet, Pierre Ossian\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = French mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 22 December 1819\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Montpellier]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 22 June 1892\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Paris]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bonnet, Pierre Ossian}}\n[[Category:1819 births]]\n[[Category:1892 deaths]]\n[[Category:University of Paris faculty]]\n[[Category:Differential geometers]]\n[[Category:École Polytechnique alumni]]\n[[Category:École Normale Supérieure faculty]]\n[[Category:19th-century French mathematicians]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Pierre Ossian Bonnet"}}}}
