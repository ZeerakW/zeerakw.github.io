He started his studies at the episcopal school of [[Lisbon Cathedral]] and later joined the [[University of Paris]], although some historians claim that he was educated at [[Montpellier]]. Wherever he studied, he concentrated on [[medicine]], [[theology]], [[logic]], [[physics]], [[metaphysics]], and [[Aristotle]]'s [[dialectic]]. He is traditionally and usually identified with the medical author [[Peter of Spain]], an important figure in the development of [[logic]] and [[pharmacology]]. Peter of Spain taught at the [[University of Siena]] in the 1240s and his ''{{lang|la|Summulae Logcales}}'' was used as a [[medieval university|university]] textbook on [[Aristotelian logic]] for the next three centuries. At the court in Lisbon, he was the councilor and spokesman for [[Afonso III of Portugal|King Afonso III]] in church matters. Later, he became [[prior]] of Guimarães. He tried to become [[Patriarch of Lisbon|bishop of Lisbon]] but was defeated. Instead, he became the master of the school of Lisbon. Peter became the physician of [[Pope Gregory X]] (1271&ndash;76) early in his reign. In March 1273 he was elected Archbishop of [[Braga]], but did not assume that post because on 3 June 1273 Gregory X created him [[Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati]].\n\n===Papacy===\n[[Image:C o a Giovanni XXI.svg|thumb|left|155px|Papal Arms of Pope John XXI]]\nAfter the death of [[Pope Adrian V]] on 18 August 1276, Peter was [[Papal election, September 1276|elected Pope]] on 8 September.<ref name=\"McBrien222\" /> He was crowned a week later on 20 September. One of John XXI's few acts during his brief reign was the reversal of a decree recently passed at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274); the decree had not only confined cardinals in solitude until they elected a successor Pope, but also progressively restricted their supplies of food and wine if their deliberations took too long. Though much of John XXI's brief papacy was dominated by the powerful Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, who succeeded him as [[Pope Nicholas III]]. John attempted to launch a [[crusade]] for the [[Holy Land]], pushed for a union with the Eastern church, and did what he could to maintain peace between the Christian nations. He also launched a [[Missionary|mission]] to convert the [[Tatars]], but he died before it could start.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope John XXI (XX)}}</ref> To secure the necessary quiet for his medical studies, he had an apartment added to the papal palace at [[Viterbo]], to which he could retire when he wished to work undisturbed. On 14 May 1277, while the pope was alone in this apartment, it collapsed; John was buried under the ruins and died on 20 May in consequence of the serious injuries he had received. He was buried in the [[Duomo di Viterbo]], where his tomb can still be seen.\n\n== Legacy ==\nAfter his death, it was rumored that John XXI had actually been a [[necromancer]], a suspicion frequently directed towards the few scholars among medieval popes (see, e.g., [[Pope Sylvester II|Sylvester II]]). It was also said that his death had been an [[act of God]], stopping him from completing a [[heresy|heretical treatise]].<ref>[[Odorico Raynaldi]], ''sub anno'' 1227, no. 19.</ref> As the works of \"Peter of Spain\" continued to be studied and appreciated, however: [[Dante Alighieri]] placed \"Pietro Spano\" in his ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso's]]'' [[Heaven of the Sun]] with the spirits of other great religious scholars.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Maxwell-Stuart, P.
