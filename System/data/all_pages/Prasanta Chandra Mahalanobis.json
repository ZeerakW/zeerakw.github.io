His grandfather Gurucharan (1833–1916) moved to Calcutta in 1854 and built up a business, starting a chemist shop in 1860. Gurucharan was influenced by [[Debendranath Tagore]] (1817–1905), father of the Nobel Prize–winning poet, [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Gurucharan was actively involved in social movements such as the [[Brahmo Samaj]], acting as its Treasurer and President. His house on 210 [[Bidhan Sarani|Cornwallis Street]] was the center of the Brahmo Samaj. Gurucharan [[Widow remarriage|married a widow]] against social traditions. His elder son Subodhchandra (1867–1953) was a distinguished educationist who studied physiology at [[Edinburgh University]]. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf] He was the Head of the Dept. of Physiology, University of Cardiff (first Indian to occupy this post in a British university). In 1900, he founded Dept. of Physiology in the Presidency College, Calcutta. Subodhchandra also became a member of the Senate of the [[Calcutta University]]. Gurucharan's younger son, Prabodh Chandra (1869-1942) was the father of P.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Mahalanobis. \nBorn in the house at 210 Cornwallis Street, P.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Mahalanobis, grew up in a socially active family surrounded by intellectuals and reformers.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nMahalanobis received his early schooling at the Brahmo Boys School in Calcutta graduating in 1908. He then joined the Presidency College, Calcutta where he was taught by teachers who included [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]], and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]]. [[Meghnad Saha]] was a year junior and [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] was two years his junior at college.<ref>{{cite book|year=1995| title=Saha and his formula|publisher=Universities Press|place=Hyderabad|author=Venkataraman, G.|page=3}}</ref> Mahalanobis received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree with honours in physics in 1912. He left for England in 1913 to join the [[University of London]]. He however missed a train and stayed with a friend at [[King's College, Cambridge]]. He was impressed by [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King's College Chapel]] there and his host's friend M. A. Candeth suggested that he could try joining there, which he did. He did well in his studies at King's, but also took an interest in cross-country walking and punting on the river. He interacted with the mathematical genius [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] during the latter's time at Cambridge. After his [[Tripos]] in physics, Mahalanobis worked with [[C. T. R. Wilson]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. He took a short break and went to India and here he was introduced to the Principal of [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]] and was invited to take classes in physics.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nHe went back to England and was introduced to the journal ''[[Biometrika]]''. This interested him so much that he bought a complete set and took them to India. He discovered the utility of statistics to problems in [[meteorology]], [[anthropology]] and began working on it on his journey back to India.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nIn Calcutta, Mahalanobis met Nirmalkumari, daughter of Herambhachandra Maitra, a leading educationist and member of the Brahmo Samaj. They married on 27 February 1923 although her father did not completely approve of it. The contention was partly due to Mahalanobis's opposition to various clauses in the membership of the student wing of the Brahmo Samaj, including restraining members from drinking and smoking. Sir [[Nilratan Sircar]], P. C. Mahalanobis's maternal uncle took part in the wedding ceremony in place of the father of the bride.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\n==Indian Statistical Institute==\n{{Main|Indian Statistical Institute}}\n[[File:ISI Delhi Mahalanobis statue.JPG|thumb|right|Mahalanobis memorial at ISI Delhi.]]\nMany colleagues of Mahalanobis took an interest in statistics and the group grew in the Statistical Laboratory located in his room at the Presidency College, Calcutta. A meeting was called on 17 December 1931 with Pramatha Nath Banerji (Minto Professor of Economics), Nikhil Ranjan Sen (Khaira Professor of Applied Mathematics) and Sir [[R.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Mukherji]]. The meeting led to the establishment of the [[Indian Statistical Institute]] (ISI), and formally registered on 28 April 1932 as a non-profit distributing learned society under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nThe Institute was initially in the Physics Department of the Presidency College and the expenditure in the first year was Rs.&nbsp;238. It gradually grew with the pioneering work of a group of his colleagues including S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Bose, J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Sengupta, [[R.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Bose]], [[S.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Roy]], K.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Nair, [[R.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Bahadur]], [[Gopinath Kallianpur]], D.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Lahiri and [[C.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Rao]]. The institute also gained major assistance through Pitamber Pant, who was a secretary to the Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. Pant was trained in statistics at the Institute and took a keen interest in the institute.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nIn 1933, the journal ''[[Sankhya (journal)|Sankhya]]'' was founded along the lines of [[Karl Pearson]]'s ''Biometrika''.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nThe institute started a training section in 1938. Many of the early workers left the ISI for careers in the United States and with the government of India. Mahalanobis invited [[J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Haldane]] to join him at the ISI and Haldane joined as a Research Professor from August 1957 and stayed on until February 1961. He resigned from the ISI due to frustrations with the administration and disagreements with Mahalanobis's policies. He was also very concerned with the frequent travels and absence of the director and complained that the ''... journeyings of our Director define a novel random vector''. Haldane however helped the ISI grow in biometrics.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dronamraju | first1 = K.

Mahalanobis had been influenced by the anthropometric studies published in the journal ''Biometrika'' and he chose to ask the questions on what factors influence the formation of European and Indian marriages. He wanted to examine if the Indian side came from any specific castes. He used the data collected by Annandale and the caste specific measurements made by [[Herbert Hope Risley|Herbert Risley]] to come up with the conclusion that the sample represented a mix of Europeans mainly with people from Bengal and Punjab but not with those from the Northwest Frontier Provinces or from Chhota Nagpur. He also concluded that the intermixture more frequently involved the higher castes than the lower ones.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dasgupta|first=Somesh|year=1993| title= The evolution of the D<sup>2</sup>-statistic of Mahalanobis| journal=Sankhya|volume=55|pages=442–459|url=http://sankhya.isical.ac.in/search/55a3/55a3040.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Analysis of race-mixture in Bengal|author=Mahalanobis, P C| year=1927| journal=J.

This measure, denoted \"D<sup>2</sup>\" and now [[eponymous]]ly named [[Mahalanobis distance]], is independent of measurement scale.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\n[[File:Biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher]]\nInspired by ''[[Biometrika]]'' and mentored by Acharya [[Brajendra Nath Seal]] he started his statistical work. Initially he worked on analysing university exam results, anthropometric measurements on [[Anglo-Indian]]s of [[Calcutta]] and some [[meteorological]] problems. He also worked as a [[meteorologist]] for some time. In 1924, when he was working on the [[probable error]] of results of agricultural experiments, he met [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Anil Kumar Gain]], with whom he established a lifelong friendship. He also worked on schemes to prevent floods.\n\n===Sample surveys===\nHis most important contributions are related to large-scale sample surveys. He introduced the concept of pilot surveys and advocated the usefulness of [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods. Early surveys began between 1937 to 1944 and included topics such as consumer expenditure, tea-drinking habits, public opinion, crop acreage and plant disease. [[Harold Hotelling]] wrote: \"No technique of random sample has, so far as I can find, been developed in the United States or elsewhere, which can compare in accuracy with that described by Professor Mahalanobis\" and Sir [[Ronald Aylmer Fisher|R.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Fisher]] commented that \"The ISI has taken the lead in the original development of the technique of sample surveys, the most potent fact finding process available to the administration\".<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nHe introduced a method for estimating crop yields which involved statisticians sampling in the fields by cutting crops in a circle of diameter 4 feet. Others such as [[P.V.Sukhatme|P.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Sukhatme]] and V.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Panse who began to work on crop surveys with the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] and the [[Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute]] suggested that a survey system should make use of the existing administrative framework. The differences in opinion led to acrimony and there was little interaction between Mahalanobis and agricultural research in later years.<ref>Rao, J. N. K.

He also worked on [[Speech Pathology]] in collaboration with Djordge Kostic, Rhea Das and Alakananda Mitter and made some contributions to the field of language correction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=|first=|title=Colti Bhasar Banan|year=1925|journal=[[Prabasi]]}}</ref>{{verify source|date=January 2014}}<!-- missing citation details -->\n\n==Later life==\nIn later life, Mahalanobis was a member of the planning commission<ref name=newspaper>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/05/15/stories/2003051500180300.htm ''The Hindu'' dated 15 May 2003]</ref> contributed prominently to newly independent India's five-year plans starting from the second. In the second five-year plan he emphasised industrialisation on the basis of a two-sector model.<ref name=\"frs\"/> His variant of [[Wassily Leontief]]'s [[Input-output model]], the [[Mahalanobis model]], was employed in the [[Five-year plans of India#Second plan (1956-1961)|Second Five Year Plan]], which worked towards the rapid industrialisation of India and with other colleagues at his institute, he played a key role in the development of a statistical infrastructure. He encouraged a project to assess deindustrialisation in India and correct some previous census methodology errors and entrusted this project to [[Daniel Thorner]].<ref name=Das>Das, Gurucharan. 2000 ''India Unbound: The Social and Economic Revolution from Independence to the Global Information Age'' Anchor Books. pp. 432 ISBN 0-375-41164-X</ref>\n\nMahalanobis also had an abiding interest in cultural pursuits and served as secretary to [[Rabindranath Tagore]], particularly during the latter's foreign travels, and also worked at his [[Visva-Bharati University]], for some time. He received one of the highest civilian awards, the [[Padma Vibhushan]] from the [[Government of India]] for his contribution to science and services to the country.\n\nMahalanobis died on 28 June 1972, a day before his seventy-ninth birthday. Even at this age, he was still active doing research work and discharging his duties as the Secretary and Director of the [[Indian Statistical Institute]] and as the Honorary Statistical Advisor to the Cabinet of the Government of India.\n\n==Honours==\n* [[Weldon Memorial Prize]] from the [[University of Oxford]] (1944)\n* Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], London (1945)<ref name=\"frs\"/><ref name=\"royal\">[http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqSearch=RefNo=='EC/1945/14'&dsqDb=Catalog Royal Society citation]</ref>\n* President of [[Indian Science Congress]] (1950)\n* Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]], USA (1951)\n* Fellow of the [[Pakistan Statistical Society|Pakistan Statistical Association]] (1952)\n* Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society]], UK (1954)\n* Sir Deviprasad Sarvadhikari Gold Medal (1957)\n* Foreign member of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] (1958)\n* Honorary Fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge]] (1959)\n* Fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]] (1961)\n* Durgaprasad Khaitan Gold Medal (1961)\n* [[Padma Vibhushan]] (1968)\n* Srinivasa Ramanujam Gold Medal (1968)\n\nThe government of India decided in 2006 to celebrate his birthday, 29 June, as National Statistical Day.<ref>[http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=22&id=168695&usrsess=1 The Statesman 25 December 2006]</ref><ref>Mohan, Rakesh 2007 Statistical system of India&nbsp;– some reflections.
