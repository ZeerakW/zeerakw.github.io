Semenov-Tien-Shansky.jpg|200px|thumb|Portrait by [[Valentin Serov]] (1905).]]\n'''Pyotr Petrovich Semenov-Tyan-Shansky''' ({{lang-ru|Пётр Петрович Семёнов-Тян-Шанский}}) (2 January ''<small>([[Gregorian Calendar|New style]]: 14 January)</small>'', 1827 &ndash; 26 February ''<small>([[Gregorian Calendar|New style]]: March 11)</small>'', 1914) was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[geographer]] and [[statistician]] who managed the [[Russian Geographical Society]] for more than 40 years.\n\nPyotr Semenov was born into a noble family and studied at [[Saint Petersburg University]]. Together with [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], Semenov attended secret meetings of the \"[[Petrashevsky Circle]]\" (a literary discussion group of progressive-minded commoner-intellectuals in St. Petersburg). During the 1850s he studied geography and [[geology]] in [[Berlin]] under [[Alexander Humboldt]] and [[Carl Ritter]], whose writings he translated into Russian.\n\nOn Humboldt's suggestion, Semenov determined to explore the largely unknown mountains of the [[Tian Shan]]. In 1856, he set off from [[Barnaul]] on his first expedition, passing through the [[Altay Mountains]] and visiting Lake [[Issyk Kul]] on his way. In 1857, he returned to the Tian Shan, exploring the interior of this hitherto unknown mountain range. Semenov was the first European to see the scenic panorama of the [[Tian Shan|Tengri Tag]], and its most beautiful peak, the colossal [[Khan Tengri]]. \n\nOne of his most interesting discoveries was to disprove Humboldt's earlier claims about Tian Shan's supposed [[volcanic]] origins. Semenov found no evidence of volcanic activity anywhere in the mountains. \nThe next year, he published the first systematic description of the Tian Shan. The reputation of this monograph was such that half a century later [[Nicholas II of Russia]] authorized him to add the epithet \"Tian-Shansky\" (that is, \"of Tian Shan\") to his last name.\n\nSemenov also became interested in [[statistics]] and did his best to advance this discipline in Russia. He served as Chairman of the Central Committee for Statistics from 1864 until 1874, when it was transformed into the Statistical Committee of the Ministry of Interior, of which he remained Chairman until 1891. It was largely due to his efforts that the first [[census]] of the [[Russian Empire]] was held in 1897. The same year, he was made a member of the [[State Council of Imperial Russia]].\n\nDuring his frequent visits to Switzerland, Italy, and France Semenov—a man of considerable fortune—amassed a collection of old [[Dutch masters]], which later passed to the [[Hermitage Museum]] and was [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings|dissipated by the Soviets]]. His insect collection consisted of ca. 700,000 specimens, while more than a hundred new species were named after him. Semenov was a member of 53 [[learned societies]] and managed the [[Russian Geographical Society]] from 1873 until his death, using this position to encourage the exploration of inland Asia, notably by [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]] and [[Pyotr Kozlov]].\n\nSemenov's memoirs were published after his death in four volumes. Several of his descendants, including a son, [[Andrey Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky]], continued his work and became scientists of note. <!-- For Semenov's account of his travels in the Tian Shan, see Petr Semenov Tian-Shanskyi, Puteshestvie v Tian Shan (Moscow: Ogiz, 1946). -->\n\n==References==\n* Semenov, Petr Petrovitch.
