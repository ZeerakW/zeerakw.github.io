His father was Edward I. Deutschlander and his mother Ida Freudenheim. Rafael studied at [[Konigsberg University]] from 1930 to 1933. He transferred to [[Hebrew University]] and obtained a [[master’s degree]] in 1934. He married Elly Iwiansky on October 12, 1934. Rafael continued his studies at Hebrew University under [[Theodore Motzkin]], obtaining a [[Ph.D.]] in 1945. Elly and Rafael raised three children: Ehud, Michal, and Barak. Ehud and Barak died before their father. Michal Artzy is emeritus professor in Marine Civilization<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141204180651/http://marsci.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/maritime-civilizations-personnel Professors of Marine Civilization] at University of Haifa</ref> at the [[University of Haifa]].\n\nRafael served as both teacher and principal of Israel High School from 1934 to 1951. He was an instructor and assistant professor at the [[Israel Institute of Technology]] from 1951 to 1956.\n\n==American tour==\nRafael Artzy took up a position as research associate and lecturer at [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]] in 1956. That year he also made his first  of many contributions to [[Mathematical Reviews]]. Artzy became [[associate professor]] at [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]] in 1960. The following year [[Rutgers University]] made him a full professor. In 1964 he was a visitor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage?page=5 Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars]</ref> He wrote ''Linear Geometry'' (1965) which was favorably reviewed by [[H. S. M. Coxeter]]<ref>[[H. S. M. Coxeter]] (1965) [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/188842.pdf Review of ''Linear Geometry''] in [[Mathematical Reviews]]</ref> In 1965 Artzy was at [[State University of New York]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. In 1967 he joined [[Temple University]] where he was for five years.\n\n==Return==\nIn 1972 Rafael Artzy returned to Israel and participated in mathematics at Technion in Haifa. He helped organize a quadrennial conference on geometry at Haifa. For instance, in March 1979 such a conference was held and the proceedings ''Geometry and Differential Geometry'' was edited by Artzy and I. Vaisman and published in Springer Lecture Notes as #792. In 1992 he published ''Geometry. An Algebraic Approach''<ref>Rafael Artzy (1992) ''Geometry. An Algebraic Approach'', Bibliographisches Institute, ISBN 3-411-15351-2, [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/1188640.pdf Review of ''Geometry'' by EJF Primrose]</ref> Artzy had made 224 contributions to ''Mathematical Reviews'' by his last submission in 1995.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [[Allen G.
