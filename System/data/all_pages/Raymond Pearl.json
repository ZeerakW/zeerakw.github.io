He spent most of his career at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]].\n\nPearl was a prolific writer of academic books, papers and articles, as well as a committed populariser and communicator of [[science]]. At his death, 841 publications were listed against his name.\n\n==Background==\nBorn of upper-middle class parents in [[New England]], Pearl excelled at school and went on to [[Dartmouth College]] where he gained his B.A. in 1899, and the [[University of Michigan]] where he gained his PhD in zoology in 1902. In 1906 he spent a year studying under [[Karl Pearson]] at [[University College, London]]. During this year he discovered [[biometry]], which seemed to offer a solution to the problems he was concerned with in biology, [[zoology]] and [[eugenics]]. On his return to the US he continued his interests, but was converted from biometry to [[Mendelian genetics]].\n\n==Eugenics and politics==\nPearl maintained a loose interest in eugenics, but in 1927 published the landmark article ''The Biology of Superiority'', which attacked the basic assumptions of eugenics.<ref>{{Cite journal | volume = 12 | pages = 257–266 | last = Pearl | first = Raymond | title = The biology of superiority | journal = American Mercury | year = 1927 }}</ref>  The article was the first general attack on eugenics by someone perceived as being within the movement.<ref name=allan>{{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-27560-6 | pages = 169‒202 | editors = Hugo Tristram Engelhardt and Arthur Leonard Caplan (eds.) | last = Allen | first = Garland E. | title = Scientific controversies: case studies in the resolution and closure of disputes in science and technology | chapter = The role of experts in scientific controversy | location = Cambridge ; New York | year = 1987 }}</ref>  It also contributed to the emergence of reform eugenics and the [[population control]] movement.

In 1908 Max Rubner observed that mammals of different size and [[longevity]] had equal [[mass]] specific [[metabolism|metabolic]] output.<ref>{{Cite book| first=Max | last=Rubner |  year=1908 | title=Das Problem der Lebensdauer und seine Beziehungen zum Wachstum und Ernahrung |  publisher=Oldenbourg | location=Munich, Germany}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Partly based on the observation that the longevity of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] varies inversely with ambient temperature,<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Loeb, Jaques and Northrop,J.H. | title=On the influence of food and temperature upon the duration of life | journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume=32 | issue=1 | date=1 October 1917| pages=103–121 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/32/1/103 }}</ref> Pearl (like Rubner) also asserted that [[maximum life span]] is inversely proportional to [[basal metabolic rate]]. Pearl accepted [[Alexis Carrel]]'s erroneous ideas that normal [[somatic cell]]s don't age, and that aging must therefore be due to dysfunction at the body level. Pearl speculated that lifespan was limited by vital cell components that were depleted or damaged more rapidly in animals with faster metabolisms.<ref>{{Cite book| first=Raymond | last=Pearl |  year=1928 | title=The Rate of Living, Being an Account of Some Experimental Studies on the Biology of Life Duration |  publisher=Alfred A.
