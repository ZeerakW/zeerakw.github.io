Punnett is probably best remembered today as the creator of the [[Punnett square]], a tool still used by [[biology|biologists]] to predict the [[probability]] of possible [[genotype]]s of offspring.  His ''Mendelism'' (1905) is sometimes said to have been the first textbook on genetics; it was probably the first [[popular science]] book to introduce genetics to the public.\n\n== Life and work ==\n\nReginald Punnett was born in 1875 in the town of Tonbridge in Kent, England.  While recovering from a childhood bout of appendicitis, Punnett became acquainted with Jardine's Naturalist's Library and developed an interest in natural history. Punnett was educated at [[Clifton College]].\n\nAttending [[Gonville and Caius College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], Punnett earned a degree in zoology in 1898, and a masters in 1901.<ref>{{acad|id=PNT894RC|name=Punnett, Reginald Crundall}}</ref> Between these degrees he worked as a demonstrator and part-time lecturer at the [[University of St. Andrews|University of St. Andrew's]] Natural History Department.  In October 1901, Punnett was back at Cambridge when he was elected to a [[Fellow]]ship at Gonville and Caius College,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=29 October 1901 |page_number=8 |issue=36598| }}</ref> working in zoology, primarily the study of worms, specifically [[nemertean]]s.  It was during this time that he and William Bateson began a research collaboration, which lasted several years.<ref>Dates given in {{cite web | url = http://www.bookrags.com/biography/r-c-punnett-wob/ | title = World of Biology | year = 2005 | publisher = Thomson Gale}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Punnett square.jpg|frame|right|A [[Punnett square]] ]]\n\nWhen Punnett was an undergraduate, [[Gregor Mendel|Gregor Mendel's]] work on inheritance was largely unknown and unappreciated by scientists.  However, in 1900, Mendel's work was rediscovered by [[Carl Correns]], [[Erich Tschermak von Seysenegg]] and [[Hugo de Vries]].  William Bateson became a proponent of [[Mendelian genetics]], and had Mendel's work translated into English.  It was with Bateson that Reginald Punnett helped established the new [[science]] of genetics at Cambridge.  He, Bateson and [[Edith Rebecca Saunders|Saunders]] co-discovered [[genetic linkage]] through experiments with chickens and sweet peas.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-and-types-of-genetic-linkage-500 Discovery and Types of Genetic Linkage], from Scitable</ref>\n\nIn 1908, unable to explain how a dominant gene would not become fixed and ubiquitous in a population, Punnett introduced one of his problems to the mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]], with whom he played [[cricket]]. Hardy went on to formulate the [[Hardy-Weinberg principle]], independently of the German [[Wilhelm Weinberg]]. He was Superintendent of the [[Cambridge University Museum of Zoology]] from 1908-1909.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cambridge University Museum of Zoology: Histories & Archives|url=http://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/collections.archives/histories.archives/|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909 he went to [[Sri Lanka]] to meet Arthur Willey, FRS, then Director of the [[National Museum of Colombo|Colombo Museum]] and R H Lock, then Scientific Assistant at the [[Peradeniya Botanical Gardens]] and to catch butterflies. The following year, he published a monograph, '\"Mimicry\" in Ceylon Butterflies, with a suggestion as to the nature of Polymorphism', in ''Spolia Zeylanica'', the journal of the Colombo Museum,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/spoliazeylanica07nati/spoliazeylanica07nati_djvu.txt RC Punnett, '\"Mimicry\" in Ceylon Butterflies, with a suggestion as to the nature of Polymorphism', '''Spolia Zeylanica''']</ref> in which he voiced his opposition to [[Gradualism|gradualistic]] accounts of the evolution of mimicry which he later expanded on, in his 1915 book 'Mimicry in Butterflies'.\n\nIn 1910 Punnett became professor of biology at Cambridge, and then the first [[Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics]] when Bateson left in 1912.  In the same year, Punnett was elected a [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society]].  He received the society's [[Darwin Medal]] in 1922.\n\nDuring World War I, Punnett successfully applied his expertise to the problem of the early determination of sex in [[chicken]]s.  Since only females were used for egg-production, early identification of male chicks, which were destroyed or separated for fattening, meant that limited animal-feed and other resources could be used more efficiently.  Punnett's work in this area was summarized in ''Heredity in Poultry'' (1923). With [[Michael Pease]] as his assistant, he created the first [[sex link|auto-sexing]] chicken breed, the Cambar, by transferring the barring gene of the [[Barred Rock]] to the [[Golden Campine]].<ref name=crew>F.A.E.
