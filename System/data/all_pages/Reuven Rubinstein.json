He has given invited and plenary lectures in many international conferences around the globe.\n\nIn 2010 Prof. Rubinstein won the INFORMS Simulation Society highest prize\n- the Lifetime Professional Achievement Award (LPAA), which recognizes scholars who have made fundamental contributions to the field of simulation that persist over most of a professional career.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Rubinstein wins the INFORMS Simulation Society Lifetime Professional Achievement Award | url = http://iew3.technion.ac.il/Home/Users/ierrr01/lpaa/lpaa.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011 Reuven  Rubinstein won the Operations Research  Society of Israel (ORSIS) highest prize\n- the Lifetime Professional Award (LPA), which recognizes scholars who have made fundamental contributions to the field of operations research over most of a professional career.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Rubinstein wins the Operations Research  Society of Israel (ORSIS) highest prize - the Lifetime Professional Award | url = http://ie.technion.ac.il/Labs/Orsis/Gallery/ierrr_prize.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n*Rubinstein R.Y., \"Simulation and the Monte Carlo Method\", Wiley, 1981.\n*Rubinstein, R.Y., \"The cross-entropy method for combinatorial and continuous Optimization\", Methodology and Computing in Applied Probability, 2, 127—190, 1999.\n*Rubinstein R.Y., \"Randomized algorithms with splitting: Why the classic randomized algorithms do not work and how to make them work\", Methodology and Computing in Applied Probability, 2009. {{doi|10.1007/s11009-009-9126-6}}\n*Rubinstein R.Y. and D.P.
