As a [[List of mathematical probabilists|probability theorist]] and statistician, Gill is known for his research on [[counting process]]es and [[survival analysis]], some of which has appeared in an advanced textbook. He is the chair of [[mathematical statistics]] at [[Leiden University]]. Gill is also known for his [[pro bono]] consulting and advocacy on behalf of victims of incompetent statistical testimony, including a Dutch nurse who was wrongfully convicted and jailed for six years.\n\n==Biography==\nHe studied mathematics at the [[University of Cambridge]] (1970–1973), and subsequently followed the Diploma of Statistics course there (1973–1974).\n\nMarrying a Dutch woman, he moved to the [[Netherlands]] where he worked from 1974 to 1988 at the [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica|Mathematical Centre]] (later renamed ''Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica'', or CWI) of [[Amsterdam]]. In 1979, Gill obtained his PhD with the thesis ''Censoring and Stochastic Integrals'', which was supervised by Jacobus Oosterhoff <!--  and Carel L. Scheffer --> of the [[Vrije Universiteit]], which awarded the doctorate.<ref name=\"MGP\">{{MathGenealogy|id=35026|title=Richard David Gill}}</ref> Gill spent Autumn 1980 at the Statistical Research Unit at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. Gill continued to collaborate with Danish (and Norwegian) statisticians for ten years, helping to write the book ''Statistical models based on counting processes'', which is often referred to as \"ABGK\" (for the authors Andersen, Borgan, Gill, and Keiding).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andersen|first1=Per Kragh|last2=Borgan|first2=Ørnulf|last3=Gill|first3=Richard D.|last4=Keiding|first4=Niels|title=Statistical models based on counting processes|series=Springer series in statistics|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|year=1993|pages=xii+767|isbn=0-387-97872-0|mr=1198884}}</ref> In 1983 he became the head of the Department of [[Mathematical Statistics]] at CWI.\n\nIn 1988 he moved to the Department of Mathematics of [[Utrecht University]]. Gill became the chair in mathematical [[stochastics]]—this chair represented the three [[mathematical sciences]] of mathematical statistics, [[probability theory]], and [[operations research]]. His PhD students include [[Sara van de Geer]] and Mark van&nbsp;der&nbsp;Laan.<ref name=\"MGP\"/>\n\nIn 2006, he moved to the Department of Mathematics at [[Leiden University]], where he became the chair of mathematical statistics. Since then, he has conducted statistical research in the theory of [[quantum information]] and in [[biostatistics]]. He has also worked on [[survival analysis]], [[semiparametric model]]s, [[causality]], [[missing data]], [[machine learning]], and [[spatial statistics|statistics]] in [[image analysis]]. Gill also publishes on the foundations of several mathematical sciences: the [[foundations of statistics]], [[foundations of probability|of probability]], [[foundations of mathematics|of mathematics]], and [[mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics|of quantum physics]].\n\n==Statistical advocacy against wrongful convictions==\n\nIn recent years he has actively lobbied for retrials for [[Lucia de Berk]] and [[Kevin Sweeney case|Kevin Sweeney]]. The nurse Lucia de Berk was sentenced to life imprisonment following testimony from a legal psychologist that de Berk with the fantastical likelihood committed a string of murders.<blockquote>\"The court was told by Dr Henk Elffers of the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement that more children had died on her shifts than appeared possible by chance. He put the odds of her presence being a mere coincidence at one in 342 million, a figure that seemed to have blinded the court to any alternative explanation of the deaths.\"<ref name=\"Hawkes\" >{{cite news|first=Nigel|last=Hawkes|authorlink=<!-- Nigel Hawkes -->|title=Did statistics damn Lucia de Berk?: Behind the numbers|date=10 April 2010|journal=The Independent (London)|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/nigel-hawkes-did-statistics-damn-lucia-de-berk-1940735.html}}</ref></blockquote>This statistical testimony was shown to be fallacious by professional statisticians, notably Gill. Continued scrutiny showed that the data had also been collected to support the prosecutor's conviction of Berk, which further invalidated the pseudo-statistical testimony.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Mark Buchanan | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=445 | issue=7125 | title=Statistics: conviction by numbers | pages=254–255 | date=18 January 2007 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7125/pdf/445254a.pdf | doi=10.1038/445254a | pmid=17230166|bibcode = 2007Natur.445..254B }}</ref><ref>[http://www.cwi.nl/pr/press-releases/2007/pb-petitieGrunwald-011107.html Persbericht CWI] Petitie 2 November 2007</ref><ref name=\"expert\">[http://www.novatv.nl/index.cfm?ln=nl&fuseaction=artikelen.details&achtergrond_id=9907 \"Expert on the most important proof in the Lucia de B. case: 'This baby has not been poisoned'\".] ''NOVA''. 29 September 2007.</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\"The conduct of the case, in Professor Gill's account, was extraordinary.   Convinced she was guilty, the police and the managers of the Juliana Children's Hospital assembled a dossier in which it seemed every death became unnatural when it had occurred during, or after, a shift in which she had worked. For one of the alleged murders, it was established on appeal she had not even been in the hospital for three days around the time it occurred.   Using more appropriate statistical methods reduced the odds from one in&nbsp;342&nbsp;million to one in&nbsp;48. A further analysis by Professor Gill further reduces the odds to one in nine.\"<ref name=\"Hawkes\" />\n</blockquote>\nProfessor Gill helped in the campaign to have a new trial. Consequently, a retrial was ordered, and de Berk was found not guilty, and received a public apology from the Dutch government, along with financial compensation (amount unknown) for her six years of incarceration.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/04/nurse_lucia_de_berk_not_guilty.php|title=Nurse Lucia de Berk finally found not guilty of murdering seven patients|date=14 April 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dutch-court-acquits-lucia-de-berk-of-killing-patients-1944577.html \"Apology for nurse jailed for murdering seven patients\"], AP, ''The Independent'' 14 April 2010.</ref>\n\n==Honours==\nRichard Gill is a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/nl/leden/leden/4165 |title=Richard Gill |language=Dutch |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref> He is a past president of [[The Netherlands Society for Statistics and Operations Research]], which publishes the [[Scientific journal|journal]] ''[[Statistica Neerlandica]]''.<ref>[http://www.vvs-or.nl/english/indexenglish.htm Board], Netherlands Society for Statistics and Operations Research.
