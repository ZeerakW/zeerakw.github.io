He was a pioneer in research linking [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] to health problems. With [[Ernst Wynder]], [[Austin Bradford Hill|Bradford Hill]] and [[Evarts Ambrose Graham|Evarts Graham]], he was credited with being the first to prove that smoking caused [[lung cancer]] and increased the risk of [[heart disease]]. (German studies had suggested a link as early as the 1920s but were forgotten or ignored until the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert|last= Proctor|authorlink=Robert N.

Educated first at [[Westminster School]], Doll originally then intended (against the wishes of his parents that he become a doctor like his father) to study mathematics at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Doll failed the mathematics scholarship from the effects of drinking too much of the College's own-brewed beer the night before.<ref>{{cite web\n  | author=McKie R\n  | title=Profile: Richard Doll\n  | publisher=The Observer\n  | date=7 July 2002\n  | url=http://gu.com/p/xdmpd\n  | accessdate =13 December 2006 }}</ref> He subsequently chose to study medicine at [[St Thomas's Hospital Medical School]], [[King's College London]] from where he graduated in 1937. Doll was a  socialist, and one of the significant figures  in the [[Socialist Health Association|Socialist Medical Association]] whose campaign helped lead to the creation of Britain's postwar [[National Health Service]].  He joined the [[Royal College of Physicians]] after the outbreak of [[World War II]] and served for much of the war as a part of the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] on a hospital ship as a medical specialist.\n\nAfter the war, Doll returned to St Thomas' to research [[asthma]]. In 1948 he joined a research team under Dr [[Francis Avery-Jones]] at the [[Central Middlesex Hospital]], run under the auspices of the statistical research unit of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]. Over a 21-year career in the unit, Doll rose to become its director. His research there initially focused on the role of occupational factors in causing [[peptic ulcer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kinlen|first1=Leo|title=Sir Richard Doll, epidemiologist – a personal reminiscence with a selected bibliography|journal=British Journal of Cancer|date=31 October 2005|volume=93|issue=9|pages=963–966|doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6602812|pmid=16249790|pmc=2361686}}</ref> In 1950, he then undertook with [[Austin Bradford Hill]] a study of lung cancer patients in 20 London hospitals, at first under the belief that it was due to the new material [[tarmac]], or motor car fumes, but rapidly discovering that [[tobacco smoking]] was the only factor they had in common.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Doll | first1 = R. | last2 = Hill | first2 = A.

In clinical medicine he has made carefully controlled trials of treatments for gastric ulcer. He has been awarded the United Nations prize for outstanding research into the causes & control of cancer & the Bisset Hawkins medal of the Royal College of Physicians for his contributions to [[preventative medicine]].''\"}}\n\nIn 1969, Doll moved to [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], to sit as the [[Regius Professor of Medicine (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Medicine]], succeeding the clinical researcher Sir George Pickering.\n\nInitially, epidemiology was held in low regard, but in his time at Oxford he helped reverse this. He was the primary agent behind the creation of [[Green College, Oxford|Green College]], which was founded in 1979.  Doll was appointed the first Warden of Green College, from where he retired in 1983.  Green College merged with [[Templeton College, Oxford|Templeton College]] in 2008 to become [[Green Templeton College, Oxford|Green Templeton College]], which is located on the site that was previously Green College.\n\nDoll also helped found the [[National Blood Service]], and was key in avoiding a system of paying donors for their blood, as had been adopted in the United States. His continued work into [[carcinogen]]s at the [[Cancer Research UK|Imperial Cancer Research Centre]] at the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], Oxford, working as part of the [[Clinical Trial Service Unit]], notably including a study undertaken with [[Richard Peto|Sir Richard Peto]], in which it was estimated that tobacco, along with infections and diet, caused between them three quarters of all cancers, which was the basis of much of the [[World Health Organisation]]'s conclusions on environmental pollution and cancer.\n\nDoll was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1966, [[Knight]]ed in 1971, and awarded the [[Royal Society of Medicine#Edward Jenner Medal|Edward Jenner Medal]] of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] in 1981.  In 1996 he was made a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]] for \"services of national importance\". International honours included the Presidential Award of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] as well as a [[UN Award]] for his research into cancer. In April 2005, he was awarded the [[Saudi Arabia]]n [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] International Prize for medicine jointly with Peto for their work on diseases related to smoking. In 2004, he was awarded the inaugural [[Shaw Prize]] for Life Sciences and Medicine for his contribution to modern cancer epidemiology.

For this promise to be properly realised, ways must be found to limit the vast damage that is now being done by tobacco and to bring home, not only to the many millions of people in developed countries but also the far larger populations elsewhere, the extent to which those who continue to smoke are shortening their expectation of life by so doing.''\"}}\n\nOne of the buildings of the [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Sutton, London]] is also named after Sir Richard Doll.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.london.ac.uk/2385.html | title=The Institute of Cancer Research | publisher=University of London | accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Research funding==\nAfter Richard Doll's death, some controversy arose over aspects of his research funding when his papers, held at the [[Wellcome Library]], indicated that for many years he had received consultancy payments from chemical companies whose products he was to defend in court. These include US$1,500 per day consultancy fee from [[Monsanto Company]] for a relationship which began in 1976 and continued until 2002. He also received fees from the [[Chemical Manufacturers Association]], [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemicals]], and [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]]. Some donations, including a £50,000 gift from asbestos company Turner and Newall, were given in public ceremony to [[Green College, Oxford]], but most fees and payments remained undisclosed to the public, Oxford University and colleagues until his death. His defenders point out that his connections to industry were widely known by those in the field, that he did his work before formal disclosure of commercial interests became commonplace and that on occasion, he came to conclusions that were unpalatable to the companies who consulted him.  His own view, as reported by [[Richard Peto]], was that it was necessary to co-operate with companies for access to data which could prove their products to be dangerous.<ref name=\"Bos\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2006/dec/08/smoking.frontpagenews|title=Industry 'paid top cancer expert|last=Boseley|first=Sarah|date=8 December 2006|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 November 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Bos2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2006/dec/08/cancer.uk|title=Expert revered for painstaking work that proved link between smoking and cancer|last=Boseley|first=Sarah|date=8 December 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lennox Johnston]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | last = Keating| first = Conrad| year = 2009| title = Smoking Kills: The Revolutionary Life of Richard Doll | publisher = Signal Books | location = Oxford | url = http://www.signalbooks.co.uk/book.php?a=1904955630}}\n*{{cite book | last = Doll | first = Richard  |author2=F.
