He was educated privately, and entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in 1827.<ref>{{acad|id=MLNS827RM|name=Milnes, Richard Monckton}}</ref> There he was drawn into a literary set, and became a member of the famous [[Apostles Club]], which then included [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], [[Arthur Hallam]], [[Richard Chenevix Trench]], [[Joseph Williams Blakesley]], and others. \nAfter graduating with an M.A. in 1831, Milnes travelled abroad, spending some time at the [[University of Bonn]]. \nHe went to Italy and [[Greece]], and published in 1834 a volume of ''Memorials of a Tour in some Parts of Greece'', describing his experiences.{{sfn|Saunders|1894}}\n\n==Political career==\nMilnes returned to London in 1837, and was elected to Parliament as member for [[Pontefract (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontefract]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]. \nIn parliament he interested himself particularly in the question of [[copyright]] and the conditions of reformatory schools. \nHe left [[Prime Minister]] [[Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Peel]]'s party over the [[Corn Law]] controversy, and was afterwards identified in politics with [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]. \nHis easy good nature had the effect that his political career was viewed with less seriousness by his contemporaries than it might otherwise have been. \nIn 1848, he went to Paris to see something of the revolution, and to fraternise with both sides. \nOn his return he wrote, as a ‘Letter to Lord Lansdowne,’ 1848.{{sfn|Saunders|1894}}\nDuring the [[Chartism|Chartist]] riots of 1848, [[Matthew Arnold]] wrote to his mother:<blockquote>Tell Miss Martineau it is said here that Monckton Milnes refused to be sworn in a [[Special Constabulary|special constable]], that he might be free to assume the post of President of the Republic at a moment's notice.<ref>[[George W. E. Russell]], Collections & Recollections (Revised edition, Smith Elder & Co, London, 1899), at page 53.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1863, Palmerston elevated Milnes to the peerage as '''Baron Houghton''', of Great Houghton in the West Riding of the County of York.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=22760 |date=7 August 1863 |startpage=3945 }}</ref>\n\n[[George W. E. Russell]] said of him: \"As years advanced he became not (as the manner of most men is) less Liberal, but more so; keener in sympathy with all popular causes; livelier in his indignation against monopoly and injustice.\"<ref>George W. E. Russell, ''Collections & Recollections'' (Revised edition, Smith Elder & Co, London, 1899), at page 57.</ref>\n\n==Literary career==\n[[File:Lord Houghton.jpg|thumb|left]]\nMilnes' literary career was often influenced by church matters. \nHe wrote a tract in 1841, which was praised by [[John Henry Newman]]. He took part in the discussion about \"[[Essays and Reviews]]\", defending the [[tractarian]] position in ''One Tract More'' (1841). He published two volumes of verse in 1838, ''Memorials of Residence upon the Continent and Poems of Many Years'', ''Poetry for the People'' in 1840 and ''Palm Leaves'' in 1844. He also wrote a ''Life and Letters of Keats'' in 1848, the material for which was largely provided by the poet's friend, [[Charles Armitage Brown]]. Milnes' [[ballad]]s were among the most popular of their day.{{sfn|Saunders|1894}}\n\nHowever, his chief distinctions were his sense of literary merit in others, and the way he fostered it. He was surrounded by the most brilliant men of his time, many of whom he had been the first to acclaim.  His reputation rests largely on the part he played, as a man of influence in society and in moulding public opinion on literary matters, in connection with his large circle of talented friends. He secured a pension for [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], helped to make [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] known in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and was one of the earliest champions of [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. \nHe helped [[David Gray (poet)|David Gray]] by writing a preface for ''The Luggie''.{{sfn|Saunders|1894}} He helped to obtain a job for [[Coventry Patmore]] at the [[British Museum]]. \nHe was, in the traditional sense, a patron of literature, who never abused the privileges of his position.\n\nMilnes has been considered as a possible author of ''[[The Rodiad]]'', a [[pornography|pornographic]] poem on the subject of [[flagellation]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Gendering the nation: studies in modern Scottish literature | first=Christopher | last=Whyte | publisher=Edinburgh University Press | year=1995 | isbn=0-7486-0619-X | page=216 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first=James G. | last=Nelson | title=Publisher to the Decadents: Leonard Smithers in the Careers of Beardsley, Wilde, Dowson | publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press | year=2000 | isbn=0-271-01974-3 | page=10 }}</ref> His apparently almost unsurpassed collection of [[erotic literature]],<ref>{{cite book | title=A history of pornography | first=Harford Montgomery | last=Hyde | authorlink=H.
