After Lewis Cox died, Elinor Cox married John Latané, who became a professor at Johns Hopkins University in 1913. In 1915 Richard enrolled at Johns Hopkins University to study physics, but his studies were cut short when he was drafted for [[World War I]]. He stayed in the US after being drafted and returned to Johns Hopkins University after the war, completing his BA in 1920. He earned his PhD in 1924; his dissertation was ''A Study of Pfund's Pressure Gauge''.<ref name=\"tribus\"/>\n\nHe taught at [[New York University]] (NYU) from 1924 to 1943, before returning to JHU to teach. He studied probability theory, the scattering of electrons, and the discharges of [[electric eel]]s.<ref name=\"tribus\"/> Richard Cox's most important work was [[Cox's theorem]].<ref>{{citation\n | last = Van Horn | first = Kevin S.\n | doi = 10.1016/S0888-613X(03)00051-3\n | issue = 1\n | journal = International Journal of Approximate Reasoning\n | mr = 2017777\n | pages = 3–24\n | title = Constructing a logic of plausible inference: a guide to Cox's theorem\n | volume = 34\n | year = 2003}}.</ref>\n\nHis wife, [[Shelby Shackleford]] (1899 [[Halifax, Virginia]] – 1987), whom he married in 1926, was an accomplished artist and illustrated ''Electric Eel Calling'', a book on electric eels.<ref name=\"tribus\"/>\n\nHe died on May 2, 1991.\n\n== Selected works==\n\n* Cox, R.
