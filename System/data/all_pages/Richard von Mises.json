He held the position of Gordon-McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at [[Harvard University]].

His literary interests included the Austrian novelist [[Robert Musil]] and the poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], on whom he became a recognized expert.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Life==\nEighteen months after his brother, the [[Austrian School]] [[economist]] [[Ludwig von Mises]],\nRichard von Mises was born in [[Lemberg]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] (former Polish city of [[Lwów]]), into a [[Jewish family]]. His parents were Arthur Edler von Mises, a doctor of technical sciences who worked as an expert for the Austrian State Railways, and Adele Landau. Richard and Ludwig also had a younger brother, who died as an infant. Richard attended the [[Akademisches Gymnasium]] in Vienna, from which he graduated with honors in [[Latin]] and mathematics in Autumn 1901. After graduating in mathematics, physics and engineering from the [[Vienna University of Technology]], he was appointed as [[Georg Hamel]]'s assistant in Brünn (now [[Brno]]). In 1905, still a student, he published an article on \"Zur konstruktiven Infinitesimalgeometrie der ebenen Kurven,\" in the prestigious ''Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik''.\n[[Image:Misescrest.gif|thumb|150px|right|The von Mises's family [[coat of arms]]]]\n\nIn 1908 Mises was awarded a doctorate from Vienna (his dissertation was on \"the determination of flywheel masses in crank drives\") and he received his [[habilitation]] from Brünn (now [[Brno]]) (on \"Theory of the [[Waterwheel]]s\") to lecture on engineering. In 1909, at 26, he was appointed professor of applied mathematics in Straßburg, then part of the [[German Empire]] (now [[Strasbourg]], [[Alsace]], [[France]]) and received [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[citizenship]]. His application for a teaching position at the [[Brno University of Technology]] was interrupted by [[World War I]].\n\nA pilot who had lectured on the design of aircraft and given in Straßburg the first university course on powered flight in 1913, he then joined the Austro-Hungarian army and flew as a [[test pilot]] and an instructor. In 1915, he supervised the construction of a 600-[[horsepower]] (450 [[kW]]) aircraft – the \"Mises-Flugzeug\" (Mises aircraft) for the Austrian army. It was completed in 1916 but never saw action.\n\nAfter the war Mises held the new chair of [[hydrodynamics]] and [[aerodynamics]] at the [[Dresden]] Technische Hochschule. In 1919 he was appointed director (with full professorship) of the new Institute of [[Applied Mathematics]] created at the behest of [[Erhard Schmidt]] at the University of Berlin. In 1921 he founded the journal [http://www.wiley-vch.de/publish/en/journals/alphabeticIndex/2233/ ''Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik''] and became its editor.\n\nWith the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] (Nazi) party to power in 1933, von Mises, felt his position threatened{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} despite his World War I military service. He moved to [[Turkey]], where he held the newly created chair of Pure and Applied Mathematics at the [[University of Istanbul]]. In 1939 he accepted a position in the [[United States]], where he was appointed 1944 Gordon-McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at [[Harvard University]]. He married [[Hilda Geiringer]] in 1943; she had been his assistant at the Institute and followed him to Turkey and then to the U.S. after losing her position in December 1933.\n\nIn 1950 Mises declined an offer of honorary membership from the [[Communist]]-dominated [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] Academy of Science.\n\n==Contributions==\nIn aerodynamics, Richard von Mises made notable advances in boundary-layer-flow theory and airfoil design. He developed the ''[[Von Mises stress|distortion energy theory]]'' of [[Stress (physics)|stress]], which is one of the most important concepts used by [[engineer]]s in material strength calculations.\n\nHis ideas were not unanimously well received, although [[Alexander Ostrowski]] had said of him:\n\n:\"Only with the appointment of Richard von Mises to the University of Berlin did the first serious German school of applied mathematics with a broad sphere of influence come into existence. Von Mises was an incredibly dynamic person and at the same time amazingly versatile like [[Carl David Tolmé Runge|Runge]]. He was especially well versed in the realm of technology.\"\n\nand also wrote:\n\n:\"Because of his dynamic personality his occasional major blunders were somehow tolerated. One has even forgiven him his theory of probability.\"\n\nYet [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], whose rival [[Axiomatic system|axiomatisation]] was better received, was less severe:\n\n:\"The basis for the applicability of the results of the mathematical theory of probability to real 'random phenomena' must depend on some form of the frequency concept of probability, the unavoidable nature of which has been established by von Mises in a spirited manner.\"\n\nIn [[solid mechanics]], Richard von Mises made an important contribution to the theory of [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] by formulating what has become known as the [[von Mises yield criterion]], independently of [[Tytus Maksymilian Huber]].\n\nHe is also often credited for the [[Principle of Maximum Plastic Dissipation]].\n\nThe [http://www.gamm-ev.de/ Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik] (International Association of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) has awarded a [http://www.gamm-ev.de/rm_preis.htm Richard von Mises-Preis] (Prize) since 1989.\n\nIn [[probability theory]], he was the person who originally proposed the now famous \"[[birthday problem]]\".<ref>[http://www.teacherlink.org/content/math/interactive/probability/lessonplans/birthday/home.html The Birthday Problem]</ref> He also defined the [[impossibility of a gambling system]].<ref>''Probability, Statistics and Truth'' by Richard von Mises 1928/1981 Dover, ISBN 0-486-24214-5 page 25</ref><ref>''Counting for something: statistical principles and personalities'' by William Stanley Peters 1986 ISBN 0-387-96364-2 page 3</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bernstein–von Mises theorem]]\n* [[Cramér–von Mises criterion]]\n* [[von Mises distribution]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n:Biography in ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'', New York, 1970–1990.\n\n:[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9052958 Biography] in ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''.\n\n===Books by date of publication===\n* Richard von Mises, [[Philipp Frank]], [[Heinrich Martin Weber|Heinrich Weber]],  [[Bernhard Riemann]], ''Die Differential- und Integralgleichungen der Mechanik und Physik'', 1925, 1930.\n* Richard von Mises, ''Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung und ihre Anwendungen in der Statistik und theoretischen Physik'', 1931.\n* Richard von Mises, ''The critical external pressure of cylindrical tubes under uniform radial and axial load'', (Translation of ''Kritischer Außendruck zylindrischer Rohre'', 1917), U.S. Experimental Model Basin, Navy Yard, 1933.\n* Richard von Mises, P.
