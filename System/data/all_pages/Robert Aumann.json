He is a professor at the Center for the Study of Rationality in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in [[Israel]]. He also holds a visiting position at [[Stony Brook University]] and is one of the founding members of the Stony Brook Center for Game Theory.\n\nAumann received the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 2005 for his work on conflict and cooperation through [[Game theory|game-theory]] analysis. He shared the prize with [[Thomas Schelling]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nAumann was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], and fled to the [[United States]] with his family in 1938, two weeks before the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom. He attended the [[Rabbi Jacob Joseph School]], a [[yeshiva]] high school in [[New York City]]. He graduated from the [[City College of New York]] in 1950 with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] in [[Mathematics]]. He received his [[Master's degree|M.Sc.]] in 1952, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Mathematics in 1955, both from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  His doctoral dissertation, ''Asphericity of Alternating Linkages'', concerned [[knot theory]].  His advisor was [[George Whitehead, Jr.]]\n\nIn 1956 he joined the Mathematics faculty of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and has been a visiting professor at [[Stony Brook University]] since 1989.\n\n=== Scientific contribution ===\n[[File:Aumann-1080b.jpg|thumb|left|300|Aumann at a meeting in 2008.]]\nAumann's greatest contribution was in the realm of [[repeated game]]s, which are situations in which players encounter the same situation over and over again.\n\nAumann was the first to define the concept of [[correlated equilibrium]] in game theory, which is a type of equilibrium in [[non-cooperative game]]s that is more flexible than the classical [[Nash equilibrium]]. Furthermore, Aumann has introduced the first purely formal account of the notion of [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] in game theory. He collaborated with [[Lloyd Shapley]] on the [[Aumann-Shapley value]]. He is also known for his [[Aumann's agreement theorem|agreement theorem]], in which he argues that under his given conditions, two [[Bayesian theory|Bayesian]] rationalists with common prior beliefs cannot agree to disagree.<ref name=\"aumann1976\">{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1214/aos/1176343654\n| issn = 0090-5364\n| volume = 4\n| issue = 6\n| pages = 1236–1239\n| last = Aumann\n| first = Robert J.\n| authorlink = Robert Aumann\n| title = Agreeing to Disagree\n| journal = The Annals of Statistics\n| year = 1976\n| jstor = 2958591\n| publisher = Institute of Mathematical Statistics\n}}</ref>\n\nAumann and [[Michael Maschler|Maschler]] used game theory to analyze [[Talmud]]ic dilemmas.<ref name = \"RiskAversion\">{{cite journal\n| last       = Aumann\n| first      = Robert J.\n| year       = 2003\n| title      = Risk Aversion in the Talmud\n| url        = http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~raumann/pdf/Risk%20aversion%20in%20the%20Talmud.pdf\n| journal    = [[Economic Theory (journal)|Economic Theory]]\n| publisher  = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]\n| volume     = 21\n| issue      = 2-3\n| pages      = 233–239\n| doi        = 10.1007/s00199-002-0304-9\n| access-date= July 29, 2015\n}}</ref> They were able to solve the mystery about the \"division problem\", a long-standing dilemma of explaining the Talmudic rationale in dividing the heritage of a late husband to his three wives depending on the worth of the heritage compared to its original worth.<ref name = \"ThreeWives\">{{cite journal\n| last1                 = Aumann\n| first1                = Yisrael\n| year                  = 1999\n| title                 = B'Inyan Mi SheHayah Nasui Shalosh Nashim\n| script-title          = he:בענין מי שהיה נשוי שלוש נשים\n| trans-title           = Regarding One who was Married to Three Wives\n| url                   = http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~raumann/pdf/Man%20with%20Three%20Wives.pdf\n| format                = pdf\n| journal               = [[w:he:מוריה (כתב עת)|מוריה]] (Moriah)\n| language              = Hebrew\n| location              = [[Jerusalem]]\n| publisher             = Machon Yerushalayim\n| volume                = 22\n| issue                 = 3-4\n| pages                 = 98–107\n| access-date           = July 29, 2015\n}}</ref> The article in that matter was dedicated to a son of Aumann, Shlomo, who was killed during the [[1982 Lebanon War]] while serving as a tank gunner in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]'s armored corps.\n\nThese are some of the themes of Aumann's Nobel lecture, named \"War and Peace\":<ref>http://nobelprize.org/economics/laureates/2005/aumann-lecture.html</ref>\n# War is not irrational, but must be scientifically studied in order to be understood, and eventually conquered;\n# [[Repeated game]] study de-emphasizes the \"now\" for the sake of the \"later\";\n# Simplistic peacemaking can cause war, while an arms race, credible war threats and mutually assured destruction can reliably prevent war.\n\n=== Political views ===\nAumann is a member in the [[Professors for a Strong Israel]] (PSI), a right-wing political group. Aumann opposed [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|the disengagement from Gaza in 2005]] claiming it is a crime against [[Gush Katif]] settlers and a serious threat to the security of [[Israel]]. Aumann draws on a case in [[game theory]] called the [[Blackmailer Paradox]] to argue that  giving land to the Arabs is strategically foolish  based on the mathematical theory.<ref name=Aumann>{{cite web |url=http://www.aish.com/jw/me/97755479.html |title=Game Theory and negotiations with Arab countries. |date=July 3, 2010 |last=Aumann |first=Robert |work=Aish.com}}</ref>  By presenting an unyielding demand, the Arab states force Israel to \"yield to [[blackmail]] due to the perception that it will leave the negotiating room with nothing if it is inflexible.\"\n\nAs a result of his political views, and his use of his research to justify them, the decision to give him the Nobel prize was criticized in the European press. A petition to cancel his prize garnered signatures from 1,000 academics worldwide.<ref>http://www.ejpress.org/article/4556</ref>\n\nIn a speech to a religious Zionist youth movement, [[Bnei Akiva]], Aumann claimed that Israel is in 'deep trouble'. He revealed his belief that the anti-Zionist [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Jews might have been right in their condemnation of the original Zionist movement. “I fear the Satmars were right.” he said, and quoted a verse from [[Psalm]] 127: “Unless the Lord builds a house, its builders toil on it in vain.” Aumann feels that the historical Zionist establishment failed to transmit its message to its successors, because it was secular. The only way that Zionism can survive, according to Aumann, is if it has a religious basis.<ref>http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3205817,00.html</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Aumann joined the new political party [[Ahi (political party)|Ahi]] led by [[Effi Eitam]] and [[Yitzhak Levy]].<ref>http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1202246357040 http://www.eitam.org.il/info_en.asp?id=2062535187</ref>\n\n=== Torah codes controversy ===\nAumann has entered the controversy of [[Bible code]]s research. In his position as both a [[Orthodox Judaism|religious Jew]] and a man of science, the codes research holds special interest to him.  He has partially vouched for the validity of the \"Great Rabbis Experiment\" (see [[bible code]] article) by  [[Doron Witztum]], [[Eliyahu Rips]], and Yoav Rosenberg, which was published in ''Statistical Science''. Aumann not only arranged for Rips to give a lecture on Torah codes in the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]], but sponsored the Witztum-Rips-Rosenberg paper for publication in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]].  The Academy requires a member to sponsor any publication in its Proceedings; the paper was turned down however.<ref>{{citation|title=The Secret Life of Numbers: 50 Easy Pieces on how Mathematicians Work and Think|first=George G.|last=Szpiro|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2006|isbn=9780309096584|page=190|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qIXl0kEwrVMC&pg=PA190}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1996, a committee consisting of Robert J. Aumann, Dror Bar-Natan, [[Hillel Furstenberg]], Isaak Lapides, and Rips, was formed to examine the results that had been reported by H.J. Gans regarding the existence of \"encoded\" text in the bible foretelling events that took place many years after the Bible was written. The committee performed two additional tests in the spirit of the Gans experiments. Both tests failed to confirm the existence of the putative code.\n\nAfter a long analysis of the experiment and the dynamics of the controversy, stating for example that \"almost everybody included [in the controversy] made up their mind early in the game\" Aumann concluded:\n\n\"''A priori'', the thesis of the Codes research seems wildly improbable... Research conducted under my own supervision failed to confirm the existence of the codes – though it also did not establish their non-existence. So I must return to my ''a priori'' estimate, that the Codes phenomenon is improbable\".<ref>{{cite journal | author=Aumann, R.H., H. Furstenberg, I. Lapides, and D.

They had met in 1953 when Esther, who was from Israel, was visiting the United States. The couple had five children; the oldest, Shlomo, was killed in action while serving in the [[Israeli Army]] in the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. Esther died of [[ovarian cancer]] in October 1998. In late November 2005, Aumann married Esther's widowed sister, Batya Cohn.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Nobelprize.org|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2005/aumann-autobio.html|title=Robert J.
