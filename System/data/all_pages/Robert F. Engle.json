Engle III - Biographical]</ref> and went on to graduate from [[Williams College]] with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in physics. He earned an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in physics and a [[Ph.D.]] in economics, both from [[Cornell University]] in 1966 and 1969 respectively.<ref>[http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~rengle/ Homepage at New York University]</ref> After completing his Ph.D., Engle became Professor of Economics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1969 to 1977.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/special/nobels.html MIT Nobel laureates]</ref> He joined the faculty of the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD) in 1975, wherefrom he retired in 2003. He now holds positions of Professor Emeritus and Research Professor at UCSD. He currently teaches at [[New York University]], [[Stern School of Business]] where he is the [[Michael Armellino]] professor in Management of Financial Services. At [[New York University]], Engle teaches for the [[Master of Science in Risk Management Program for Executives]],<ref>[http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/academic/global/riskmanagement/ Master of Science in Risk Management for Executives Program]</ref> which is offered in partnership with the [[Amsterdam Institute of Finance]].<ref>[http://www.aif.nl/ Amsterdam Institute of Finance]</ref>\n\nEngle’s most important contribution was his path-breaking discovery of a method for analyzing unpredictable movements in financial market prices and [[interest rates]]. Accurate characterization and prediction of these volatile movements are essential for quantifying and effectively managing [[risk]]. For example, risk measurement plays a key role in pricing [[option (finance)|options]] and [[financial derivatives]]. Previous researchers had either assumed constant [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] or had used simple devices to approximate it. Engle developed new statistical models of volatility that captured the tendency of stock prices and other financial variables to move between high volatility and low volatility periods (“Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity: ARCH”). These statistical models have become essential tools of modern [[arbitrage pricing theory]] and practice.\n\nMore recently, Engle (and [[Eric Ghysels]]) co-founded the Society for Financial Econometrics (SoFiE).\n\n===Personal life===\n* Paternal Grandfather{{spaced ndash}}Robert Fry Engle, Sr. (b. 1879 d. 1946)\n* Father{{spaced ndash}}Robert Fry Engle, Jr. (b. 1910 d. 1981, [[DuPont]] chemist)\n* Mother{{spaced ndash}}Mary Starr Engle (\"Murry\", French teacher, m. 1939)\n* Sister{{spaced ndash}}Patricia Lee Engle (\"Patty\", twin, [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]] official)\n* Sister{{spaced ndash}}Sally Starr Engle Merry ([[Anthropology|anthropologist]], twin)\n* Wife{{spaced ndash}}Marianne Eger Engle ([[psychologist]], m. 10-Aug-1969, two children)\n* Daughter{{spaced ndash}}Lindsey Engle Richland ([[psychologist]])\n* Son{{spaced ndash}}Jordan Engle] ([[actor]], b.
