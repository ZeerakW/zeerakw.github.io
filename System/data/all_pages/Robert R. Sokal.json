In 1939, following the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany]], he escaped with his family to [[China]]. He earned his bachelor's degree at [[Saint John's University, Shanghai|St. John's College]] in [[Shanghai]] and from there moved with his wife Julie to the [[University of Chicago]], where he also worked as a [[librarian]] to complement his scholarship. He took his Ph.D. degree under the supervision of the well-known termite systematist [[Alfred E. Emerson]]. He was also strongly influenced by [[Sewall Wright]], who served on his [[dissertation]] committee. Sokal developed an interest for [[statistics]] and quantitative biology.\n\nIn 1959, Sokal moved to the [[University of Kansas]] where he developed&mdash;initially in collaboration with [[Charles Duncan Michener]]&mdash;quantitative techniques for classifying organisms and building dendrograms, which later came to be called [[numerical taxonomy]] methods. At the [[State University of New York]], Stony Brook, in collaboration with [[F. James Rohlf]], Sokal worked on new statistical methods for the analysis of geographic variation. His interests shifted to [[anthropology]] and [[population genetics]], and he directed studies on the population history of [[Europe]] as inferred from genetic and ethnohistorical data. Along with [[Luca Cavalli-Sforza]], Sokal pioneered the comparative study of linguistic and genetic variation.\n\n==Awards and honors==\n* Fellow, [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], 1983\n* Fellow, [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 1986\n* [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], 1975, 1983\n* Member, [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], 1987\n* Doctor of Science (honorary), [[University of Crete]], Iraklion, 1990\n* Distinguished Statistical Ecologist Award, [[International Association for Ecology]], 1994\n* Darwin Lifetime Achievement Award, [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]], 2004\n\n==Works==\n\n===Selected scientific bibliography (original articles)===\n* Sokal R.R. and Michener C.D.
