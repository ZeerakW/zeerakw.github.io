[[Jürgen Kuczynski]] is his son.  His father Wilhelm was a banker.\n\nRené studied at the universities of Berlin, Munich, Freiburg and Strasburg and made his doctoral dissertation in 1897. Later, he worked for the [[United States Census Office]]. In 1904 he became director of the Staistical Office in [[Elberfeld]] and in 1906 took the same position in Berlin -Schoneberg.\n\nHe studied rent and income in Berlin before the first World War and found that 600,000 people lived in flats which house five or more people per room.  \n\nIn 1926, Kuczynski chaired the [[Kuczynski Committee]], working with the German League for Human Rights, which organized the petition for a referendum on the [[Expropriation of the Princes in the Weimar Republic|expropriation of the Princes]].  \n\nIn 1928 he led the German delegation to the tenth anniversary of the Russian Revolution.\n\nIn 1933, after [[Hitler]] had come to power, Kuczynski left Germany and went with around 20,000 books (half of the large family library) to [[Great Britain]]. There he lectured at the [[London School of Economics]] and became later adviser for the British [[Colonial Office]]. His most noted work was in the 1930s when he published figures on the extent of the slave trade between Africa and the Americas over the preceding three centuries. His figure of 15 million slaves became widely used by other researchers, but is [[Atlantic Slave Trade#Human toll|no longer thought to be correct]].\n \nAn obituary of his son Jürgen [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-jurgen-kuczynski-1245205.html] refers to Rene as a banker - and the family does seem to have been massively wealthy. [[Eric Hobsbawm]] (\"''Interesting Times''\", p.145) states that while Jürgen was a \"charming and ever-hopeful economic historian\", his family \"owned the [[Grunewaldviertel]]\" in Berlin and he was \"probably the richest citizen of east Berlin\".\n\nKuczynski and wife Berta Gradenwitz had six children. Among them the [[East Germany|GDR]]-economist [[Jürgen Kuczynski]], [[Brigitte Kuczynski]], and [[Ursula Kuczynski]]. All of them were Soviet spies.<ref>[http://www.spymuseum.com/pages/agent-kuczynski-ruth.html The Spy Museum, 2007]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.pl/books?id=VNSMrps8mpcC&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=ruth+kuczynski&source=bl&ots=XG91XflHcd&sig=_J3iOIgpBmLycjUG35ox4uom_oE&hl=pl&ei=XBcnSrqbOtfPjAe1q8DcBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2#PPA155,M1 Richard  C.S.
