He was a Professor at the [[University of Toronto]] from 1985 to 1998. In his work, he develops statistical tools for the analysis of complex datasets, most recently in [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]].\n\nHis most well-known contributions are the\n[[Lasso regression|LASSO method]], which proposed the use of  L<sup>1 </sup> penalization in regression and related problems, and [[Significance Analysis of Microarrays]]. He has also co-authored three well-known books: \"Generalized Additive Models\", \"An Introduction to the Bootstrap\", and \"The Elements of Statistical Learning\",<ref name=\"ElementsStatLearn\">{{cite web | url=http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/ | title=The Elements of Statistical Learning | author1=Hastie, Trevor | author2=Tibshirani, Robert | author3=Friedman, Jerome H. | authorlink1=Trevor Hastie | authorlink3=Jerome H.

He received his B. Math. in statistics and computer science from the [[University of Waterloo]] in 1979 and a Master's degree in Statistics from [[University of Toronto]] in 1980. Tibshirani joined the doctoral program at [[Stanford University]] in 1981 and received his Ph.D. in 1984 under the supervision of [[Bradley Efron]]. His dissertation was entitled \"Local likelihood estimation\".<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=15880}}</ref>\n\nHis son, Ryan Tibshirani, with whom he occasionally publishes scientific papers, is currently an Assistant Professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in the department of Statistics, jointly in the department of the Machine Learning.\n\n==Honors and awards==\nTibshirani received the [[COPSS Presidents' Award]] in 1996. Given jointly by the world's leading\nstatistical societies, the award recognizes outstanding contributions to statistics by a statistician under the age of 40.  He is a fellow of\nthe [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]], the [[American Statistical Association]], and a (Canadian) Steacie award winner. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] in 2001 and a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/2012_05_01_NAS_Election.html|title=National Academy of Sciences Members and Foreign Associates Elected|date=May 1, 2012|publisher=National Academy of Sciences}}</ref>\n\nTibshirani was made the 2012 [[Statistical Society of Canada]]'s Gold Medalist at their yearly meeting in Guelph, Ontario for \"exceptional contributions to methodology and theory for the analysis of complex data sets, smoothing and regression methodology, statistical learning, and classification, and application areas that include public health, genomics, and proteomics\".<ref name=\"SSC-2012\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ssc.ca/en/award-winners/award-winners-2012 | title=SSC Award Winners in 2012 |accessdate=15 June 2012 }}</ref> He gave his Gold Medal Address at the 2013 meeting in Edmonton.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Tibshirani, Robert\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Canadian statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = July 10, 1956\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = Niagara Falls, Ontario\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tibshirani, Robert}}\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:People from Niagara Falls, Ontario]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Canadian statisticians|Tibshirani, Robert]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Stanford University Department of Statistics faculty]]\n[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Robert Tibshirani"}}}}
