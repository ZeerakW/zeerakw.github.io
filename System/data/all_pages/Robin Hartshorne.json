Hartshorne is an [[algebraic geometry|algebraic geometer]] who studied with [[Oscar Zariski|Zariski]], [[David Mumford|Mumford]], [[J.-P. Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]].  \n\nHe was a [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition|Putnam Fellow]] in Fall, 1958. He received his [[doctorate]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1963<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=29466}}</ref> and then became a [[Junior Fellow]] at [[Harvard University]], where he taught for several years. In the 1970s he was appointed to the faculty at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  He is currently retired.  \n\nHartshorne is the author of the popular text ''[[Algebraic Geometry (book)|Algebraic Geometry]]''.  He plays the [[shakuhachi]], and paints.\n\nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-19.</ref>\n\n==Selected publications==\n*''Foundations of Projective Geometry'', New York: W.
