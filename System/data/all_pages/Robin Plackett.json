In 1987 the [[Royal Statistical Society]] awarded him the [[Guy Medal]] in Gold, having awarded him both the bronze and silver medals earlier in his career.\n\nHe authored several books on statistics, including '' Principles of Regression Analysis '' (1960), ''The Analysis of Categorical Data'' (1974) and '' An Introduction to the Interpretation of Quantal Responses in Biology'' (1979, with P. S. Hewlett).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal| url=http://www.enbis.org/docs/magazine/2005/october_2005 | journal=Scientific Computing World| title=Facing the future with confidence | year=2005| pages=39 | issue=October/November 2005 |first=Shirley | last=Coleman}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-985X.2009.00623.x|title=Robert Lewis Plackett, 1920–2009|journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A]]|first=Peter|last=Diggle|authorlink=Peter Diggle|author2=Henderson, Robin |author3=Matthews, John |year=2010|volume=173|issue=1|pages=265–267|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123208808/abstract}}\n\n{{Guy Medal}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Plackett, Robin\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American statistician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 3 September 1920\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 23 June 2009\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Plackett, Robin}}\n[[Category:Academics of Newcastle University]]\n[[Category:English statisticians]]\n[[Category:1920 births]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:Winners of the Guy Medal in Gold]]\n[[Category:Winners of the Guy Medal in Bronze]]\n[[Category:Winners of the Guy Medal in Silver]]\n[[Category:2009 deaths]]\n\n\n{{UK-statistician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Robin Plackett"}}}}
