He founded '''ix2''', an educational products company based in [[Park City, Utah]], in 2011. In 1999 he co-founded Sandvik Innovations LLC with Sandvik Publishing – Sandvik Innovations LLC was sold in 2011 to the Horizon Group; in the early 1990s he developed the Booktronics product line for Readers Digest, and before that was the Executive Vice-President of the [[Price Stern Sloan]] publishing company.<ref>[http://ix2intelligentinnovations.com/IX2introduction.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.parkrecord.com/ci_20292875/invention-class-at-kimball-art-center-teach-problem]</ref>\n\nRoger Burrows has invented a number of technologies including Magnix, Photo Q, and Booktronics and developed [[Questron (education)|Questron]], an interactive book and electronic \"wand\" system for children.<ref>[http://www.alibris.co.uk/search/books/isbn/9780394881676 Questron titles at Alibris.com]</ref> He has produced exhibitions for the Leonardo, Utah's Science and Technology Museum, for the [[Investiture of the Prince of Wales]], and for the [[Architectural Association]] in London.\n\n==Altair Design/Images==\nBurrows worked with Ensor Holiday, of [[Guy's Hospital]], London, in the early 1970s, developing a set of geometric patterns called Altair Designs. Altair Designs were variations of a unique and unusual [[Islamic art|Islamic design]] constructed on an arrangement of [[Close-packing of equal spheres|close packing of circles]], with variation in circle sizes.<ref>Bourgoin: ''Le Trait des Entrelacs'' (''Arabic Geometrical Pattern & Design'') (1879) (reprinted, [[Dover Books]], 1973) – source for some of the ideas for Altair Designs</ref> The design variations were found to have unique visual properties and served to stimulate the visual imagination. Altair Designs were originally published by [[Random House]] as colouring books for both adults and children under the ''Altair Design'' name.<ref>''Altair Design'' by Ensor Holiday. Random House (1973) ISBN 0-394-82548-9</ref> Burrows began developing, in the late 1960s, a dynamic geometry of close packing spheres of different sizes where spheres change size and move from one unique close packing arrangement to another, creating unique three-dimensional forms. Burrows has given numerous lectures on his geometry of close packing spheres as well as lectures on the evolution of geometrical systems through time, and how they were applied by cultures in the past. Burrows has also developed designs based on close packing circle arrangements generated by his geometry of spheres, including ''Images: The Ultimate Coloring Experience,'' and ''Hidden Images'' published by [[Running Press]].<ref>''Images: The Ultimate Coloring Experience.\" Philadelphia: Running Press, 1992 through to 2011</ref> Burrows redrew all of the original Altair designs for [[Wooden Books]] published in 2009. ''Altair Designs'' and ''Images'' designs are all based on unique geometrical structures – in the case of Altair Designs they are based on two arrangements of close packing circles and in the case of \"Images\" designs based on close packing circle arrangements of all sorts plus many other precise geometrical systems.\n\n==Other work==\nBurrows was an acquaintance, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, of [[Francis Huxley]], (nephew of [[Aldous Huxley]]), author and teacher, who encouraged his early exploration of the cultural development of geometrical forms. He was also an acquaintance of quantum physicist [[David Bohm]] and [[Sufi]] writer [[Idries Shah]]. Whilst working at Price Stern Sloan Burrows worked with various celebrities, including [[Frank Zappa]]. Burrows is also a developer of interactive products for children, an inventor, and a technology developer, having developed and patented Questron, an electronic book system; Booktronics electronic books; Magnix, a print based system that makes paper, card, and plastic magnetically interactive; Photo Q, a means to print high resolution images on fabric; Trimensions, a technology that transforms books into three-dimensional experience; and many other technologies.
