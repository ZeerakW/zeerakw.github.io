Having started research under the professor of geometry and astronomy, Sir [[W. V. D. Hodge]], Penrose finished his PhD at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] ([[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]) in 1958, writing a thesis on \"tensor methods in algebraic geometry\" under algebraist and geometer [[J. A. Todd|John A. Todd]]. He devised and popularised the [[Penrose triangle]] in the 1950s, describing it as \"impossibility in its purest form\" and exchanged material with the artist [[M. C. Escher]], whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it. Escher's [[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]], and [[Ascending and Descending]] were in turn inspired by Penrose.\n\nAs reviewer Manjit Kumar puts it:\n{{quote|As a student in 1954, Penrose was attending a conference in Amsterdam when by chance he came across an exhibition of Escher's work. Soon he was trying to conjure up impossible figures of his own and discovered the tribar [see [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Penrose-dreieck.svg tri-bar] for an image] – a triangle that looks like a real, solid three-dimensional object, but isn't. Together with his father, a physicist and mathematician, Penrose went on to design a staircase that simultaneously loops up and down. An article followed and a copy was sent to Escher. Completing a cyclical flow of creativity, the Dutch master of geometrical illusions was inspired to produce his two masterpieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/oct/16/cycles-time-roger-penrose-review|title=Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe by Roger Penrose – review|work=The Guardian}}</ref>}}\n\nHaving become a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] at Birkbeck College, London (and having had his attention drawn from pure mathematics to astrophysics by the cosmologist [[Dennis Sciama]], then at Cambridge) it was in 1964 that, in the words of [[Kip Thorne]]  of Caltech, \"Roger Penrose revolutionised the mathematical tools that we use to analyse the properties of spacetime\". Until then work on the curved geometry of general relativity had been confined to configurations with sufficiently high symmetry for Einstein's equations to be soluble explicitly, and there was doubt about whether such cases were typical. One approach to this issue was by  the use of [[perturbation theory]], as developed under the leadership of [[John Archibald Wheeler]] at Princeton. The other, more radically innovative, approach initiated by Penrose was to overlook the detailed geometrical structure of spacetime and instead concentrate attention just on the topology of the space, or at most its [[conformal structure]], since it is the latter - as determined by the lay of the lightcones - that determines the trajectories of lightlike geodesics, and hence their causal relationships. The importance of Penrose's epoque-making paper \"Gravitational collapse and space-time singularities\"<ref name=Penrose1965>{{cite journal|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=January 1965|volume=14|issue=3|pages=57–59|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.14.57|url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.14.57|bibcode = 1965PhRvL..14...57P }}</ref> was not only its result - roughly that if an object such as a dying star implodes beyond a certain point, then nothing can prevent the gravitational field getting so strong as to form some kind of\nsingularity. It also showed a way to obtain similarly general conclusions in other contexts, notably that of the cosmological [[Big Bang]], which he dealt with in collaboration with [[Dennis Sciama]]'s most famous student, [[Stephen Hawking]].\n\n[[file: CNRSblackhole.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Predicted view from outside the horizon of a black hole lit by a thin accretion disc]]\nIt was in the local context of gravitational collapse that the contribution of Penrose was most decisive, starting with his 1969 cosmic censorship conjecture, to the effect that any ensuing singularities would be confined within a well-behaved [[event horizon]]  surrounding a hidden space-time region for which Wheeler coined the term [[black hole]], leaving a visible exterior region with strong but finite curvature, from which some of the gravitational energy may be extractable by what is known as the [[Penrose process]], while accretion of surrounding matter may release further energy that can account for astrophysical phenomena such as [[quasars]].\n\nFollowing up his \"weak [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]]\",  Penrose went on, in 1979, to formulate a stronger version called the \"strong censorship hypothesis\". Together with the [[BKL conjecture]] and issues of nonlinear stability, settling the censorship conjectures is one of the most important outstanding problems in [[general relativity]]. Also from 1979 dates Penrose's influential [[Weyl curvature hypothesis]] on the initial conditions of the observable part of the universe and the origin of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].<ref>{{cite conference | author = R.

He made several conjectures about C and the WCH, some of which were subsequently proved by others, and the smoothness is real.\n\nIn simple terms, he believes that the singularity in [[Einstein's field equation]] at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]]. The latter singularity can be removed by a change of [[coordinate system]], and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang. One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and therefore we are not necessarily constrained by the [[Wheeler–DeWitt equation]], which disrupts time. Alternatively, one can use the [[Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations]].\n\n==Physics and consciousness==\n[[File:Roger Penrose 9671.JPG|thumb|Prof. Penrose at a conference.]]\n\nPenrose has written books on the connection between fundamental physics and human (or animal) consciousness. In ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'' (1989), he argues that known laws of physics are inadequate to explain the phenomenon of consciousness. Penrose proposes the characteristics this new physics may have and specifies the requirements for a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics (what he calls ''correct quantum gravity''). Penrose uses a variant of [[Turing's halting theorem]] to demonstrate that a system can be [[deterministic]] without being [[algorithmic]]. (For example, imagine a system with only two states, ON and OFF. If the system's state is ON when a given [[Turing machine]] halts and OFF when the Turing machine does not halt, then the system's state is completely determined by the machine; nevertheless, there is no algorithmic way to determine whether the Turing machine stops.)\n\nPenrose believes that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may come into play in the quantum mechanical [[Wave function collapse|wave function reduction]], and may be harnessed by the brain. He argues that the present computer is unable to have intelligence because it is an algorithmically deterministic system. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer. This contrasts with supporters of [[computational theory of mind|strong artificial intelligence]], who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends [[formal logic]] because things such as the insolubility of the [[halting problem]] and [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight. These claims were originally espoused by the philosopher [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].\n\nThe Penrose/Lucas argument about the implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorem for computational theories of human intelligence has been widely criticised by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers, and the consensus among experts in these fields seems to be that the argument fails, though different authors may choose different aspects of the argument to attack.<ref>\nCriticism of the Lucas/Penrose argument that intelligence can not be entirely algorithmic:\n* [http://consc.net/mindpapers/6.1b MindPapers: 6.1b.

This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24&nbsp;nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, but still well short of the 25&nbsp;ms required if the quantum processing in the theory was to be linked to the 40&nbsp;Hz gamma synchrony, as Orch-OR suggested. To bridge this gap, the group made a series of proposals.\n\nHe supposed that the interiors of neurons could alternate between liquid and [[gel]] states. In the gel state, it was further hypothesized that the water electrical dipoles are oriented in the same direction, along the outer edge of the microtubule tubulin subunits. Hameroff et al. proposed that this ordered water could screen any quantum coherence within the tubulin of the microtubules from the environment of the rest of the brain. Each tubulin also has a tail extending out from the microtubules, which is negatively charged, and therefore attracts positively charged ions. It is suggested that this could provide further screening. Further to this, there was a suggestion that the microtubules could be pumped into a coherent state by biochemical energy.

In the last decade, some researchers who are sympathetic to Penrose's ideas have proposed an alternative scheme for quantum processing in microtubules based on the interaction of tubulin tails with microtubule-associated proteins, motor proteins and presynaptic scaffold proteins. These proposed alternative processes have the advantage of taking place within Tegmark's time to decoherence.\n\nHameroff, in a lecture in part of a [[Google Tech talks]] series exploring [[quantum biology]], gave an overview of current research in the area, and responded to subsequent criticisms of the Orch-OR model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXFFbxoHp3s |title=Clarifying the Tubulin bit/qubit – Defending the Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR Model (Quantum Biology) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref> In addition to this, a recent 2011 paper by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff gives an updated model of their Orch-OR theory, in light of criticisms, and discusses the place of consciousness within the universe.<ref name=\"Hameroff-Penrose 2011\">{{cite web|author=Roger Penrose|author2=Stuart Hameroff|last-author-amp=yes |url=http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/Cosmology160.html |title=Consciousness in the Universe: Neuroscience, Quantum Space-Time Geometry and Orch OR Theory |journal =[[Journal of Cosmology]] |publisher=Quantumconsciousness.org |date=4 July 1992 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nPhillip Tetlow, although himself supportive of Penrose's views, acknowledges that Penrose's ideas about the human thought process are at present a minority view in scientific circles, citing Minsky's criticisms and quoting science journalist [[Charles Seife]]'s description of Penrose as \"one of a handful of scientists\" who believe that the nature of consciousness suggests a quantum process.<ref name=\"Tetlow 2007 166\"/>\n\nIn January 2014 Hameroff and Penrose announced that a discovery of quantum vibrations in microtubules by Anirban Bandyopadhyay of the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anirban_Bandyopadhyay |title=Anirban Bandyopadhyay |publisher=[[ResearchGate]] |accessdate=2014-02-22}}</ref> confirms the hypothesis of Orch-OR theory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm |title=Discovery of quantum vibrations in 'microtubules' inside brain neurons supports controversial theory of consciousness |publisher=''[[ScienceDaily]]'' |accessdate=2014-02-22}}</ref>  A reviewed and updated version of the theory was published along with critical commentary and debate in the March 2014 issue of ''[[Physics of Life Reviews]]''.<ref name=Hameroff2014>{{cite journal|author1=S.
