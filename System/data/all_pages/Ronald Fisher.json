C. Punnett]], and [[Horace Darwin]]. He saw [[eugenics]] as addressing a pressing social and scientific issues that encompassed both genetics and statistics. During World War I Fisher started writing book reviews for the ''Eugenic Review'' and volunteered to undertake all such reviews for the journal, being hired for a part-time position. The last third of ''The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection'' focussed on eugenics, attributing the fall of [[civilization]]s to the fertility of their upper classes being diminished, and used British 1911 census data to show an inverse relationship between fertility and social class, partly due, he claimed, to the lower financial costs and hence increasing social status of families with less children. He proposed the abolition of extra allowances to large families, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father. He served in several official committees to promote Eugenics.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} In 1934, he resigned from the Eugenics Society over a dispute about increasing the power of scientists within the movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===The Race Question===\nHe opposed [[UNESCO]]'s [[The Race Question]], believing that evidence and everyday experience showed that human groups differ profoundly \"in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development\" and concluded that the \"practical international problem is that of learning to share the resources of this planet amicably with persons of materially different nature\", and that \"this problem is being obscured by entirely well-intentioned efforts to minimize the real differences that exist\". The revised statement titled \"The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry\" (1951) was accompanied by Fisher's dissenting commentary.<ref>http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000733/073351eo.pdf \"The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry\", p. 27.
