KÁLMÁN</ref> ({{lang-hu|Kálmán Rudolf Emil}}; born May 19, 1930) is a Hungarian-born American [[electrical engineer]], mathematician, and inventor. He is most noted for his co-invention and development of the [[Kalman filter]], a mathematical algorithm that is widely used in [[signal processing]], [[control system]]s, and [[Guidance, navigation and control]]. For this work, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] awarded Kálmán the [[National Medal of Science]] on October 7, 2009.\n\n==Biography==\nRudolf Kálmán was born in [[Budapest]] in 1930. After emigrating to the [[United States]] in 1943, he earned his bachelor's degree in 1953 and his master's degree in 1954, both from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], in [[electrical engineering]]. Kálmán completed his doctorate in 1957 at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. \n\nKálmán worked as a Research Mathematician at the [[Research Institute for Advanced Studies]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] from 1958 until 1964. He was a professor at [[Stanford University]] from 1964 until 1971, and then a Graduate Research Professor and the Director of the Center for Mathematical System Theory, at the [[University of Florida]] from 1971 until 1992. Starting in 1973, he also held the chair of Mathematical System Theory at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in [[Zürich, Switzerland]]. \n\n== Work ==\nKálmán is an [[electrical engineer]] by his undergraduate and graduate education at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T]]. and [[Columbia University]], and he is noted for his co-invention of the [[Kalman filter]] (or Kalman-Bucy Filter), which is a mathematical technique widely used in the [[digital computers]] of [[control system]]s, [[navigation]] systems, [[avionics]], and outer-space vehicles to extract a [[signal processing|signal]] from a long [[sequence]] of noisy and/or incomplete  technical measurements, usually those done by electronic and gyroscopic systems. \n\nKálmán's ideas on filtering were initially met with vast skepticism, so much so that he was forced to do the first publication of his results in [[mechanical engineering]], rather than in electrical engineering or systems engineering. Kálmán had more success in presenting his ideas, however, while visiting [[Stanley F. Schmidt]] at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] in 1960. This led to the use of Kálmán filters during the [[Apollo program]], and furthermore, in the NASA [[Space Shuttle]], in Navy [[submarine]]s, and in unmanned [[aerospace]] vehicles and weapons, such as [[cruise missile]]s. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\nKálmán is a member of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]], the American [[National Academy of Engineering]], and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He is a foreign member of the Hungarian, French, and Russian Academies of Science. He has been awarded many honorary doctorates from other universities. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-27.</ref>\n\nKálmán received the [[IEEE Medal of Honor]] in 1974, the [[IEEE Centennial Medal]] in 1984, the Inamori foundation's [[Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology]] in 1985, the [[Steele Prize]] of the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1987, the [[Richard E.
