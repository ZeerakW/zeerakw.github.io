The author of both fiction and non-fiction, he is best known for the novels in the [[Ware Tetralogy]], the first two of which (''[[Software (novel)|Software]]'' and ''[[Wetware (novel)|Wetware]]'') both won [[Philip K. Dick Award]]s. Until its closure in 2014 he edited the science fiction [[webzine]] ''[[Flurb]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nRucker was born and raised in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. He is the great-great-great-grandson of the philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Rudyrecker.com|url=http://www.rudyrucker.com/pdf/vonbittertreelarge.pdf|title=Family tree of Rucker's mother's brother, Rudolf von Bitter}}</ref>\n\nRucker attended [[St. Xavier High School, Louisville, Kentucky|St. Xavier High School]] before earning a B.A. in [[mathematics]] from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1967 and M.S. (1969) and PhD (1973) degrees in mathematics from [[Rutgers University]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rudy Rucker|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/716/000023647/|work=[[NNDB]]}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nRucker taught at the [[State University of New York at Geneseo]] from 1972 to1978. Thanks to a grant from the [[Alexander von Humboldt]] Foundation, Rucker taught math at the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg]] from 1978 to 1980. He then taught at [[Randolph-Macon Women's College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] from 1980 to 1982, before trying his hand as a full-time author for four years. Inspired by an interview with [[Stephen Wolfram]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hplusmagazine.com/articles/ai/wolframalpha-searching-truth |title=Rudy Rucker interviews Stephen Wolfram|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> Rucker became a computer science professor at [[San José State University]] in 1986, from which he retired in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rudy Rucker|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2005/Issues/09Rucker.html|work=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]}}</ref> A mathematician with philosophical interests, he has written ''[[The Fourth Dimension (book)|The Fourth Dimension]]''; ''Geometry, Relativity and the Fourth Dimension''; and ''Infinity and the Mind''. [[Princeton University Press]] published new editions of ''[[Infinity and the Mind]]'' in 1995 and in 2005, both with new prefaces; the first edition is cited with fair frequency in academic literature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nAs his \"own alternative to cyberpunk,\" Rucker developed a writing style he terms [[Transrealism (literature)|Transrealism]]. Transrealism, as outlined in his 1983 essay \"The Transrealist Manifesto,\" is science fiction based on the author's own life and immediate perceptions, mixed with fantastic elements that symbolize psychological change. Many of Rucker's novels and short stories apply these ideas. One example of Rucker's Transrealist works is ''Saucer Wisdom,'' a novel in which the main character is [[Abduction Phenomenon|abducted by aliens]]. Rucker and his publisher marketed the book, tongue in cheek, as non-fiction.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nHis earliest Transrealist novel, ''[[White Light (novel)|White Light]],'' was written during his time at [[Heidelberg]]. This Transrealist novel is based on his experiences at [[State University of New York at Geneseo|SUNY Geneseo]].\n\nRucker often uses his novels to explore scientific or mathematical ideas; ''White Light''<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Across the Universe: Planetary Politics|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/books/review/Itzkoff-t.html|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=December 16, 2007}}</ref> examines the concept of infinity, while the [[Ware Tetralogy]] (written from 1982 through 2000) is in part an explanation of the use of [[natural selection]] to develop software (a subject also developed in his ''The Hacker and the Ants'', written in 1994). His novels also put forward a [[mystical]] philosophy that Rucker has summarized in an essay titled, with only a bit of irony, \"The Central Teachings of Mysticism\" (included in ''Seek!'', 1999).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Central Teachings of Mysticism|url=http://www.rudyrucker.com/blog/2012/10/06/the-central-teachings-of-mysticism/}}</ref>\n\nHis non-fiction book, ''The Lifebox, the Seashell, and the Soul: What Gnarly Computation Taught Me About Ultimate Reality, the Meaning Of Life, and How To Be Happy'' summarizes the various philosophies he's believed over the years and ends with the tentative conclusion that we might profitably view the world as made of computations, with the final remark, \"perhaps this universe is perfect.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Expand list|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Fiction===\n\n====Novels====\n*The [[Ware Tetralogy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Wares|work=Rudyrucker.com|url=http://www.rudyrucker.com/wares/}}</ref>\n**''[[Software (novel)|Software]]'' (1982)\n**''[[Wetware (novel)|Wetware]]'' (1988)\n**''Freeware'' (1997)\n**''Realware'' (2000)\n*Transrealist novels\n**''[[White Light (novel)|White Light]]'' (1980)\n**''Spacetime Donuts'' (1981)\n**''The Sex Sphere'' (1983)\n**''The Secret of Life'' (1985)\n**''[[The Hacker and the Ants]]'' (1994) (Revised 'Version 2.0' 2003)\n**''Saucer Wisdom'' (1999) novel marketed as non-fiction\n**''The Big AHA'' (2013)\n*Other Novels\n**''[[Master of Space and Time]]'' (1984)\n**''The Hollow Earth'' (1990)\n**''[[Spaceland (novel)|Spaceland]]'' (2002)\n**''As Above, So Below: A Novel of [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Peter Bruegel]]'' (2002)\n**''Frek and the Elixir'' (2004)\n**''[[Mathematicians in Love]]'' (2006)\n**''[[Postsingular]]'' (2007)\n**''[http://www.rudyrucker.com/hylozoic/ Hylozoic]''  (sequel to ''Postsingular, May 2009)''\n**''[http://www.rudyrucker.com/jimandtheflims/ Jim and the Flims]'' (2011)\n**''[http://www.rudyrucker.com/turingandburroughs/ Turing and Burroughs]'' (2012)\n\n====Story collections====\n*''The Fifty-Seventh Franz Kafka'' (1983)\n*''Transreal!'', also includes some non-fiction essays (1991)\n*''Gnarl!''
