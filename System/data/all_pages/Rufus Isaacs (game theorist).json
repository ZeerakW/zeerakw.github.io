His investigation stemmed from classic [[pursuit-evasion]] type [[zero-sum]] dynamic two player games such as the [[Princess and monster game]]. In 1942, He married Rose Barcov, and they had two daughters.\n\nHis work in [[pure mathematics]] included working with [[monodiffric function]]s, [[fractional-order mapping]]s, [[graph theory]], [[analytic function]]s, and [[number theory]]. In graph theory he constructed the first two infinite families of [[snark (graph theory)|snarks]]. In [[applied mathematics]], he worked with [[aerodynamics]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], and differential games, which he is most known for. He received his bachelors from [[MIT]] in 1936, and received his MA and PhD from [[Columbia University]] in 1942 and 1943 respectively.<ref>His doctoral advisor was [[Edward Kasner]]</ref> His first post after the war ended was at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], but he left in 1947 due to salary issues. While at RAND, much of his work was classified, and thus remained unknown until the publication of his classic text on differential games a decade after leaving RAND. His career after RAND was spent largely in the defense and avionics industries. While at RAND, he worked with researchers including [[Richard E. Bellman]], [[Leonard D. Berkovitz]], [[David H. Blackwell]], [[John M. Danskin]], [[Melvin Dresher]], [[Wendell Fleming|Wendell H. Fleming]], [[Irving L. Glicksberg]], [[Oliver A. Gross]], [[Samuel Karlin]], [[John W. Milnor]], [[John F. Nash]], and [[Lloyd S. Shapley]]. His work has significant influence on mathematical optimization including fundamental concepts such as [[dynamic programming]] ([[Richard E. Bellman]]) and the [[Pontryagin maximum principle]] (Breitner 2005) which are widely used in economics and many other fields.\n\n==Selected work(s)==\n*Isaacs, Rufus. ''[[Differential Games]]'', John Wiley and Sons, 1965.\n\n==The Isaacs Award==\nThe executive board of the [[International Society of Dynamic Games]] decided in 2003 to establish a [http://isdg-site.org/default.aspx?page=award prize] to recognize the \"outstanding contribution to the theory and applications of dynamic games\" of two scholars at each of its symposium, starting in 2004. The prize was named after Rufus Isaacs. The recipients of this prize are: Yo-Chi Ho & [[George Leitmann]] (2004); [[Nikolay Krasovsky|Nikolay Krasovskii]] & [[Wendell Fleming]] (2006); Pierre Bernhard & Alain Haurie (2008); [[Tamer Başar]] & Geert Jan Olsder (2010); Steffen Jørgensen & [[Karl Sigmund]] (2012); Eitan Altman & [[Leon Petrosjan|Leon Petrosyan]] (2014).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pursuit-evasion|Pursuit-evasion games]]\n*[[Princess and Monster game]]\n*[[Search games]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Yu, P.L. \"An appreciation of professor Rufus Isaacs\" Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, Springer Netherlands.
