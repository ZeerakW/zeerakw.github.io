Olshansky is an [[associate editor]] of the ''[[Journal of Gerontology|Journal of Gerontology: Biological Sciences and Biogerontology]]'' and is a member of the [[editorial board]]s of several other [[scientific journal]]s. Olshansky has been working with colleagues in the biological sciences to develop the modern \"biodemographic paradigm\" of mortality – an effort to understand the biological nature of the survival and dying out processes of living organisms. The focus of his research has been on estimates of the upper limits to human [[longevity]], exploring the health and public policy implications associated with individual and population [[aging]], forecasts of the size, survival, and age structure of the population, pursuit of the scientific means to slow aging in people (The Longevity Dividend), and global implications of the re-emergence of infectious and [[parasitic diseases]], and insurance linked securities.<ref name=auto>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjayolshansky.com |title=S.
