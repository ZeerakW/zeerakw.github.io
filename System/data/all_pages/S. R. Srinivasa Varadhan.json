In an article in the ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society'', Stroock  recalls these early years:\n{{Quotation|Varadhan, whom everyone calls Raghu, came to these shores from his native India in the fall of 1963. He arrived by plane at Idlewild Airport and proceeded to Manhattan by bus. His destination was that famous institution with the modest name, The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, where he had been given a postdoctoral fellowship. Varadhan was assigned to one of the many windowless offices in the Courant building, which used to be a hat factory. Yet despite the somewhat humble surroundings, from these offices flowed a remarkably large fraction of the postwar mathematics of which America is justly proud.}}\nVaradhan is currently a professor at the Courant Institute.<ref name=\"steele\">[http://www.ams.org/notices/199611/comm-steele.pdf Announcement of the] 1996 [[Steele Prize]]s at the [[American Mathematical Society]] web site, accessed 21 February 2007.</ref><ref name=\"abelbio\">Srinivasa Varadhan is known as S R S Varadhan for short and Raghu to his friends and colleagues.
