Stouffer spent much of his career attempting to answer the fundamental question - How does one measure an attitude?\n\nDr. Stouffer served as a professor of sociology at both the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Harvard University]], and also directed the Laboratory of Social Relations at Harvard.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Sac City, Iowa]], Stouffer received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] at [[Morningside College]], [[Sioux City]] in 1921, then went on to earn a [[Master of Arts]] in English at [[Harvard University]] in 1923. He returned to Sac City in 1923 to manage and edit his father's newspaper, the ''[[Sac Sun]]'', until 1926 when he sold it and started his doctoral studies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Joseph W|title=Samuel A.

Dr. Stouffer earned his [[PhD]] in sociology in 1930 at the [[University of Chicago]]. His dissertation was “An Experimental Comparison of Statistical and Case-History Methods of Attitude Research”. He then served as  a professor of sociology, statistics, and social statistics at universities such as the University of Chicago, the [[University of London]], and the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].<ref>Ryan, 2013</ref>\n\n==Principal Works==\n\n===''Studies in Social Psychology in World War II: The American Soldier''.===\n(Princeton University Press, 1949).\n\nStouffer and a distinguished team of social scientists working for the War Department surveyed over a half million American soldiers during [[World War II]] using interviews, over two hundred questionnaires, and other techniques to determine their attitudes on everything from [[racial integration]] to their officers’ performance. Their answers, almost always complex and often also counterintuitive, reveal individuals both defining and defined by their society and their primary groups. Stouffer’s work in World War II led to the [[Expert Infantryman Badge|Expert]] and [[Combat Infantryman Badge]]s, revision of pay scales, the demobilization point system, and influenced what appeared in ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly]], [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars & Stripes]]'', and Frank Capra’s “[[Why We Fight]]” propaganda films. Additionally, it was Stouffer and his colleagues who during their research for ''The American Soldier'' developed the important sociological concept of “[[relative deprivation]]”, which roughly stated is the idea that one determines his status based on comparison with others.<ref>Stouffer, Samuel A., Edward A.

Through both anecdotal and highly disciplined research data, Stouffer illuminated the attitudes of Americans to nonconformist behavior in general, and to what liberals considered the intolerance of the McCarthy Era in particular. Although he found no “national neurosis”, what he did find was that Americans remained mostly concerned about their day-today existence – an important discovery in the face of an increasingly mass-culture society. He also found differing levels of tolerance based on socio-economic factors.\n\nAmong his other major works is ''Social Research to Test Ideas'', (The Free Press, 1962).\n\n==Activities==\nProfessor Stouffer was a delegate to the International Conference on Population in Paris, 1938, President of the American Sociological Society 1952-3, President of the American Association of Public Opinion Research 1953-54, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Association, [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the American Statistical Association, the Sociological Research Association, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the Population Association of America, the Psychometric Association, and  the Harvard and Cosmos Clubs.\n\nHe also consulted with scores of private and public institutes, a partial listing of which includes:\n*American Standards Association,\n*Cooperative Test Service of the American Council on Education, \n*University of California,\n*American Economic Association,\n*Population Association of America,\n*Atomic Scientists of Chicago,\n*National Committee on Atomic Information,\n*The American Psychoanalytic Association.<ref>Stouffer Correspondence, 1946-1960, Harvard University Archives (Pusey Library)</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nStouffer is described by his family and those who knew him well as a gentleman of warmth, compassion, restless energy, high standards, depth, and a puckish sense of humor. His academic lectures, through which he often chain-smoked, were littered with allusions and quotations from Shakespeare, and these would often be accompanied by baseball statistics. Deeply intellectually curious and impatient for survey results, Prof. Stouffer would frequently sit by the IBM punched card sifting machine to see the raw answers to his queries. (These traits help to explain how he produced the classic ''Communism, Conformity and Civil Liberties'' so quickly). In his few free hours he favored [[Mickey Spillane]] novels and listening to baseball on the radio. His correspondence reveals a clear thinking pragmatist with a deep sense of responsibility to his society and to his profession. As James Davis writes in the introduction to ''Communism, Conformity and Civil Liberties'' (reprinted in 1992 by Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick), “Sam was a great sociologist….”\n\n==Legacy==\nSamuel Stouffer’s influence reaches well beyond military history and sociology. His work is cited in journals as diverse as Child Development Abstract, The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, and Commentary. His research has had a lasting effect on polling procedures and analysis, market research and interpretation, race relations, population and nuclear policies, education, and economics. Additionally, his clear, honest writing style, free of unexplained jargon and “bureaucratese”, remains a model of the simple, elegant use of the English language.<ref>Ryan, 2013</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Joseph W.
