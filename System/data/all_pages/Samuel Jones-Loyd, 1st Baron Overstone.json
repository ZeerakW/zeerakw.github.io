Loyd joined his father's bank, and took control of the bank after his father retired in 1844. On his father's death in 1858 Loyd inherited an estate worth [[Pound sterling|£]] 2 million. In 1864 the bank became incorporated with the [[London and Westminster Bank]].<ref>[http://www.rbs.com/about03.asp?id=ABOUT_US/OUR_HERITAGE/OUR_HISTORY/OUR_BANKING_FAMILY/PAST_CONSTITUENTS/LONDON_AND_WESTMINSTER_BANK RBS History]</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nLoyd sat in parliament as [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] member for [[Hythe (UK Parliament constituency)|Hythe]] from 1819 to 1826,<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/><ref>[http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Hcommons4.htm leighrayment.com House of Commons: Horncastle to Hythe]</ref> and unsuccessfully contested [[Manchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester]] in 1832. As early as 1832 he was recognized as one of the foremost authorities on banking, and he enjoyed much influence with successive ministries and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|chancellors of the exchequer]]. Loyd is considered as one of the great figures in British monetary history, particularly with respect to the [[Bank Charter Act of 1844]]. He was also opposed to [[limited liability]] and the introduction of a [[decimal currency]]. In 1850 he was raised to the peerage as '''Baron Overstone''', of Overstone and of Fotheringhay, both in the County of Northampton.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=21073 |date=1 March 1850 |startpage=653 }}</ref> Lord Overstone was a member of [[The Club (Literary Club)]] and the [[Political Economy Club]] and served as [[High Sheriff of Warwickshire]] in 1838<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=19586|startpage=232|date=2 February 1838}}</ref> and as [[President of the Royal Statistical Society]] from 1851 to 1853.
