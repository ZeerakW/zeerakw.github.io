Lindquist]]; his thesis dealt with a problem of statistical measurement in education, and was published in the ''[[Journal of Educational Psychology]]''. Wilks became an instructor in mathematics at [[Princeton University]] in 1933; in 1938 he assumed the editorship of the journal ''[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]'' in place of [[Harry C. Carver]]. Wilks assembled an advisory board for the journal that included major figures in statistics and probability, among them [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Jerzy Neyman]], and [[Egon Pearson]].\n\nWilks was named professor of mathematics and director of the Section of Mathematical Statistics at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1944, and became chairman of the Division of Mathematics at the university in 1958. He was noted for his work on multivariate statistics. He also conducted work on [[unit-weighted regression]], proving the idea that under a wide variety of common conditions, almost all set of weights will yield composites that are very highly correlated (Wilks, 1938), a result that has been dubbed [[Wilks's theorem]] (Ree, Carretta, & Earles, 1998).\n\nFrom the start of his career, Wilks favored a strong focus on practical applications for the increasingly abstract field of mathematical statistics; he also influenced other researchers, notably [[John Tukey]], in a similar direction. Drawing upon the background of his thesis, Wilks worked with the Educational Testing Service in developing the standardized tests like the [[SAT]] that have had a profound effect on American education. He also worked with [[Walter Shewhart]] on statistical applications in quality control in manufacturing.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] he was a consultant with the [[Office of Naval Research]]. Both during and after the War he had a profound impact on the application of statistical methods to all aspects of military planning.\n\nWilks died in 1964 in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].\n\nThe [[American Statistical Association]] named its [[Wilks Memorial Award]] in his honor.\n\n[[Wilks's lambda distribution]] is a [[probability distribution]] related to two [[statistical independence|independent]] [[Wishart distribution|Wishart distributed]] variables. It is important in [[multivariate statistics]] and [[likelihood-ratio test]]s.\n\n==References==\n* Mosteller, Frederick. \"Samuel S.
