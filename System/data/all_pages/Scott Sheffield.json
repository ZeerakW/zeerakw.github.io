He studies the [[Schramm-Loewner evolution]] SLE(κ) and its relations to a variety of other random objects. For example, he proved that SLE describes the interface between two Liouville quantum gravity surfaces that have been [[conformal welding|conformally welded]] together.<ref>Conformal weldings of random surfaces: SLE and the quantum gravity zipper, Scott Sheffield, 2010, http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4797</ref> In joint work with Oded Schramm, he showed that contour lines of the [[Gaussian free field]] are related to SLE(4).<ref>Contour lines of the two-dimensional discrete Gaussian free field, Oded Schramm and Scott Sheffield, 2006, http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605337</ref><ref>A contour line of the continuum Gaussian free field, Oded Schramm and Scott Sheffield, 2010, http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2447</ref> With Jason Miller, he developed the theory of Gaussian free field flow lines, which include SLE(κ) for all values of κ, as well as many variants of SLE.<ref>Imaginary Geometry I: Interacting SLEs, Jason Miller and Scott Sheffield, 2012, http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1496</ref>\n\nSheffield and Bertrand Duplantier proved the Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (KPZ) relation for fractal scaling dimensions in Liouville quantum gravity.<ref>Liouville Quantum Gravity and KPZ, Bertrand Duplantier and Scott Sheffield, 2008, http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1560</ref> Sheffield also defined the [[conformal loop ensemble]]s, which serve as scaling limits of the collection of all interfaces in various statistical physics models.<ref>Exploration trees and conformal loop ensembles, Scott Sheffield, 2006, http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0609167</ref> In joint work with [[Wendelin Werner]], he described the conformal loop ensembles as the outer boundaries of clusters of Brownian loops.<ref>Conformal loop ensembles: the Markovian characterization and loop soup construction, Scott Sheffield and Wendelin Werner, 2010, http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2374</ref>\n\nIn addition to these contributions, Sheffield has also proved results regarding internal [[diffusion limited aggregation]], [[domino tiling|dimers]], [[game theory]], [[partial differential equations]], and Lipschitz extension theory.<ref>2011 Loève Prize announcement, http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/aldous/Research/sheffield.pdf</ref>\n\n==Education and Career==\nSheffield graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1998 with an A.B. and A.M. in mathematics. In 2003, he received his Ph.D. in mathematics from [[Stanford University]]. Before becoming a professor at MIT, Sheffield held postdoctoral positions at [[Microsoft Research]], the [[University of California at Berkeley]], and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. He was also an associate professor at [[New York University]].<ref>http://math.mit.edu/~sheffield/cv.html, MIT, retrieved 2013-23-08</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nScott Sheffield received the [[Loève Prize]], the [[Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers]], the [[Sloan Research Fellowship]], and the [[Rollo Davidson Prize]]. He was also an invited speaker at the 2010 meeting of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Sheffield, Scott\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = October 20, 1973\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = \n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sheffield, Scott}}\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Scott Sheffield"}}}}
