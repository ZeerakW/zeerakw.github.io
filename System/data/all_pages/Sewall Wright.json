He was a founder of [[population genetics]] alongside [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[J.B.S. Haldane]], which was a major step in the development of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] combining [[genetics]] with [[evolution]]. He discovered the [[inbreeding coefficient]] and methods of computing it in [[Breed registry|pedigree animals]]. He extended this work to [[population]]s, computing the amount of [[inbreeding]] between members of populations as a result of random [[genetic drift]], and along with Fisher he pioneered methods for computing the distribution of [[gene frequency|gene frequencies]] among  populations as a result of the interaction of [[natural selection]], [[mutation]], migration and genetic drift.

His parents were first cousins{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}, an interesting fact in light of Wright's later research on [[inbreeding]]. The family moved three years later after Philip accepted a teaching job at [[Lombard College]], a [[Universalist]] college in Galesburg, Illinois.\n\nAs a child, Wright helped his father and brother print and publish an early book of poems by his father's student [[Carl Sandburg]].\n\nHe was the oldest of three gifted brothers—the others being the [[aeronautical engineer]] [[Theodore Paul Wright]] and the [[political scientist]] [[Quincy Wright]]. From an early age Wright had a love and talent for [[mathematics]] and [[biology]]. Wright attended [[Galesburg High School]] and graduated in 1906. He then enrolled in [[Lombard College]] where his father taught, to study [[mathematics]]. He was influenced greatly by Professor Wilhelmine Entemann Key, one of the first women to receive a [[Doctorate|Ph.D.]] in [[biology]]. Wright received his Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]], where he worked at the [[Bussey Institute]] with the pioneering mammalian geneticist [[William Ernest Castle]] investigating the inheritance of coat colors in [[mammals]]. He worked for the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] until 1925, when he joined the Department of Zoology at the [[University of Chicago]]. He remained there until his retirement in 1955, when he moved to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. He received many honors in his long career, including the [[National Medal of Science]] (1966), the [[Balzan Prize]] (1984), and the [[Darwin Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] (1980). He was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society]].<ref name=\"frs\"/> The [[American Mathematical Society]] selected him as the Josiah Willards Gibbs lecturer for 1941.<ref>[http://www.ams.org/meetings/lectures/meet-gibbs-lect Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectures]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Wright, Sewall|title=Statistical genetics and evolution|journal=Bull.

The X and Y axes represent continuous phenotypic traits, and the height at each point represents the corresponding organism's fitness. The arrows represent various mutational paths that the population could follow while evolving on the fitness landscape.]]\n\nHis papers on [[inbreeding]], [[mating system]]s, and [[genetic drift]] make him a principal founder of [[population genetics|theoretical population genetics]], along with [[R. A. Fisher]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane]]. Their theoretical work is the origin of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] or neodarwinian synthesis. Wright was the inventor/discoverer of the [[inbreeding coefficient]] and [[F-statistics]], standard tools in population genetics. He was the chief developer of the mathematical theory of [[genetic drift]], which is sometimes known as the Sewall Wright effect, cumulative stochastic changes in [[gene frequency|gene frequencies]] that arise from random births, deaths, and Mendelian segregations in reproduction.  In this work he also introduced the concept of [[effective population size]]. Wright was convinced that the interaction of [[genetic drift]] and the other evolutionary forces was important in the process of adaptation. He described the relationship between genotype or phenotype and [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] as [[fitness surface]]s or [[evolutionary landscape]]s. On these landscapes mean population fitness was the height, plotted against horizontal axes representing the [[allele frequency|allele frequencies]] or the average phenotypes of the population. [[Natural selection]] would lead to a population climbing the nearest peak, while [[genetic drift]] would cause random wandering.\n\n=== Evolutionary theory ===\nWright's explanation for [[punctuated equilibrium|stasis]] was that organisms come to occupy [[adaptive peak]]s. In order to evolve to another, higher peak, the species would first have to pass through a valley of maladaptive intermediate stages. This could happen by [[genetic drift]] if the population is small enough. If a species was divided into small populations, some could find higher peaks. If there was some [[gene flow]] between the populations, these adaptations could spread to the rest of the species. This was Wright's [[shifting balance theory]] of evolution. There has been much skepticism among evolutionary biologists as to whether these rather delicate conditions hold often in natural populations. Wright had a long standing and bitter debate about this with [[R. A. Fisher]], who felt that most populations in nature were too large for these effects of genetic drift to be important.\n\n=== Path analysis ===\nWright's statistical method of [[path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]], which he invented in 1921 and which was one of the first methods using a [[graphical model]], is still widely used in social science. He was a hugely influential reviewer of manuscripts, as one of the most frequent reviewers for Genetics. Such was his\nreputation that he was often credited with reviews that he did not write.\n\n=== Plant and animal breeding ===\nWright strongly influenced [[Jay Lush]], who was the most influential figure in introducing [[quantitative genetics]] into [[animal breeding|animal]] and [[plant breeding]].\nFrom 1915 to 1925 Wright was employed by the Animal Husbandry Division of the U.S. Bureau of Animal Husbandry.  His main project was to investigate the inbreeding that had occurred in the artificial selection that resulted in the leading breeds of livestock used in American beef production.  He also performed experiments with 80,000 guinea pigs in the study of physiological genetics. Further more he analyzed characters of some 40,000 guinea pigs in 23 strains of brother-sister matings against a random-bred stock. (Wright 1922a-c).  The concentrated study of these two groups of mammals eventually led to the Shifting Balance Theory and the concept of \"surfaces of selective value\" in 1932.  (Wright 1988 Pg 122 American Naturalist)\n\nHe did major work on the genetics of [[guinea pigs]], and many of his students became influential in the development of mammalian genetics. He appreciated as early as 1917 that genes acted by controlling [[enzyme]]s. An anecdote about Wright, disclaimed by Wright himself, describes a lecture during which Wright tucked an unruly guinea pig under his armpit, where he usually held a chalkboard eraser: according to the anecdote, at the conclusion of the lecture, Wright absent-mindedly began to erase the blackboard using the guinea pig.\n\n===Wright and philosophy===\n\nWright was one of the few geneticists of his time to venture into [[philosophy]]. He found a union of concept in [[Charles Hartshorne]], who became a lifelong friend and philosophical collaborator. Wright endorsed a form of [[panpsychism]]. He believed that the birth of the consciousness was not due to a mysterious property of increasing complexity, but rather an inherent property, therefore implying these properties were in the most elementary particles.<ref>Steffes, David M. (2007). ''Panpsychic Organicism: Sewall Wright's Philosophy for Understanding Complex Genetic Systems''. ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]''. Vol. 40, No. 2. pp. 327-361.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nWright and Fisher, along with J.B.S. Haldane, were the key figures in the [[modern synthesis]] that brought genetics and evolution together.  Their work was essential to the contributions of [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]], [[Ernst Mayr|Mayr]], [[George Gaylord Simpson|Simpson]], [[Julian Huxley]], and [[G. Ledyard Stebbins|Stebbins]].  The modern synthesis was the most important development in evolutionary biology after [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]. Wright also had a major effect on the development of mammalian genetics and biochemical genetics.\n\nAn interesting anecdote about Sewall Wright and [[Barbara McClintock]] is linked here:<ref>http://www.estherlederberg.com/Anecdotes.html; see anecdote #25</ref>\n\n[[OpenMx]] has as its icon a representation of Wright's Piebald [[Guinea Pig]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | author=Wright, Sewall | year=1984| title= Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations v. 1 (Genetic & Biometric Foundations); New Edition | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=0-226-91038-5}}\n* {{cite book | author=Wright, Sewall | year=1984| title= Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations v. 2 (Theory of Gene Frequencies); New Edition | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=0-226-91039-3}}\n* {{cite book | author=Wright, Sewall | year=1984| title= Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations v. 3 (Experimental Results and Evolutionary Deductions); New Edition | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=0-226-91040-7}}\n* {{cite book | author=Wright, Sewall | year=1984| title= Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations v. 4 (Variability within and Among Natural Populations); New Edition | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=0-226-91041-5}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Michael Ghiselin|Ghiselin, Michael T.]] (1997) [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&vid=ISBN0791434672 ''Metaphysics and the Origin of Species''].
