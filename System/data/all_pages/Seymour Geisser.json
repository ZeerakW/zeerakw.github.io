He also pioneered the theory of [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]].\n\nHe testified as an expert on interpretation of [[DNA]] evidence in more than 100 civil and criminal trials.  He held that prosecutors often relied on flawed statistical models. On that topic, he wrote \"Statistics, Litigation and Conduct Unbecoming\" in the book ''Statistical Science in the Courtroom'', edited by Joe Gastwirth (Springer Verlag, 2000).\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[City of New York|New York City]].  He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1955 under [[Harold Hotelling]].  In 1971, he founded the School of Statistics at the [[University of Minnesota]], of which he was the Director for more than 30 years.\n\n==Books==\n* {{citation\n|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=wfdlBZ_iwZoC }}\n|title=Predictive Inference: An Introduction <!-- useful if want to copy citation\n|first=Seymour\n|last=Geisser\n|authorlink=Seymour Geisser\n-->\n|publisher=[[CRC Press]]\n|year=1993\n|isbn=0-412-03471-9\n}}\n* ''Modes of Parametric Statistical Inference'', Wiley, 2006\n\nGeisser was also the principal editor of several books of papers by multiple authors.\n\n==Obituary==\n* {{cite journal |first=Donald A. |last=Berry |year=2005 |title=Seymour Geisser, 1929–2004 |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]] |series=Series A |volume=168 |issue= |pages=245–6 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-985X.2005.346_1.x }}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Wayback |date=20020908090642 |url=http://www.stat.umn.edu/People/IndivFaculty/seymour.spiel.html |title=Seymour Geisser }}\n*{{Wayback |date=19970706161505 |url=http://www.stat.umn.edu/booklet/seymour/homepage.html |title=Seymour Geisser }}\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=41382 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Geisser, Seymour\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = October 5, 1929\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = March 11, 2004\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = St. Paul, Minnesota, USA\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geisser, Seymour}}\n[[Category:1929 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from New York City]]\n[[Category:University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill alumni]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Seymour Geisser"}}}}
