He is regarded as one of the leaders in [[differential geometry and topology|differential geometry]] of the twentieth century.<ref name=frs/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years in China===\nChern was born in Xiushui County ([[:zh:秀水|秀水]]縣), [[Jiaxing]], in [[Zhejiang]] province. The year after his birth, China changed its regime from the [[Qing Dynasty]] to the [[Republic of China]]. He graduated from Xiushui Middle School (秀水中學) and subsequently moved to [[Tianjin]] in 1922 to accompany his father. In 1926, after spending four years in Tianjin, Chern graduated from Fulun High School ([[:zh:扶輪中學|扶輪中學]]).<ref name=\"Chern Tianjin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jiaxing.gov.cn/art/2008/10/28/art_93_1125.html |title=Shiing-Shen Chern |publisher=Jiaxing Culture    |accessdate=Aug 22, 2010|language=zh}}</ref>\n\nAt age 15, Chern entered the Faculty of Sciences of the [[Nankai University]] in Tianjin, studied mathematics there, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1930. At Nankai, Chern's mentor was [[Li-Fu Chiang]] ([[:zh:姜立夫|姜立夫]]), a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-trained geometer. Also at Nankai, he was heavily influenced by the physicist Hu Guoding (胡國定). Hu is today considered to be one of the founding fathers of modern Chinese [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].\n\nChern went to [[Beiping]] (now Beijing) to work at the [[Tsinghua University]] Department of Mathematics as a teaching assistant. At the same time he also registered at Tsinghua [[Graduate school|Graduate School]] as a student. He studied [[projective differential geometry]] under Prof. [[Sun Guangyuan]], a [[University of Chicago]]-trained geometer and [[logician]] who was also from Zhejiang. Sun is another mentor of Chern who is considered a founder of modern Chinese mathematics. In 1932, Chern published his first research article in the Tsinghua University Journal. In the summer of 1934, Chern graduated from Tsinghua with a master's degree, the first ever master's degree in mathematics issued in China.<ref name=\"Chern Tianjin\"/>\n\n[[Chen Ning Yang|Chen-Ning Yang]]'s father — [[Yang Ko-Chuen]], another Chicago-trained professor at Tsinghua, but specialising in [[algebra]], also taught Chern. At the same time, Chern was Chen-Ning Yang's teacher of undergraduate maths at Tsinghua.\n\nAt Tsinghua, [[Hua Luogeng]], also a mathematician, was Chern's colleague and room-mate.\n\nIn 1932, [[Wilhelm Blaschke]] from the University of Hamburg visited Tsinghua and was impressed by Chern and his research.\n\n===In Europe===\nIn 1934, co-funded by Tsinghua and the Chinese Foundation of Culture and Education, Chern went to continue his study in mathematics in Germany with a scholarship. Chern studied at the [[University of Hamburg]] and worked under Blaschke's guidance first on the geometry of webs then on the Cartan-[[Erich Kähler|Kähler]] theory. He obtained his ''Dr. rer.nat.'' (''[[Doctor of Science]]'', which is equivalent to PhD) degree in February, 1936. Blaschke recommended Chern to study in Paris.\n\nIn August 1936, Chern watched [[1936 Summer Olympics|summer Olympics]] in Berlin together with [[Hua Luogeng]] who paid Chern a brief visit. During that time, Hua was studying at the University of Cambridge in Britain.\n\nIn September 1936, Chern went to Paris and worked with [[Élie Cartan]]. Chern spent one year at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris.\n\nIn 1937, Chern accepted Tsinghua's invitation and was promoted to professor of mathematics at Tsinghua. However, at the same time the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] (near Beijing) happened and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] started, Tsinghua was forced to move away from Beijing to west China. Three universities including Peking University, Tsinghua, and Nankai formed the [[National Southwestern Associated University]] (NSAU), and was relocated in [[Kunming]], Yunnan province. Chern never reached Beijing. In the same year, [[Hua Luogeng]] was promoted to professor of mathematics at Tsinghua.\n\n===Short stay in USA===\n\nIn July 1943, Chern went to the United States, and worked at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (IAS) in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] on [[characteristic class]]es in differential geometry. Shortly afterwards, he was invited by [[Solomon Lefschetz]] to be an editor of ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''.\n\n===First return to China===\nChern returned to Shanghai in 1946 to help found the Institute of Mathematics of the [[Academia Sinica]], which was later moved to [[Nanking]] (then-capital of the Republic of China). Chern was the acting president of the institute. [[Wu Wenjun]] was Chern's graduate student at the institute.\n\nIn 1948, Chern was elected one of the first academicians of the Academia Sinica. He was the youngest academician elected (at age 37).\n\n===USA===\n\nIn 1949, Chern returned to the United States, again worked at the IAS. In 1949,  Chern became professor of mathematics at the [[University of Chicago]]. Coincidentally, [[Ernest Preston Lane]], former Chair at UChicago Department of Mathematics, was the doctoral advisor of Chern's undergraduate mentor at Tsinghua — [[Sun Guangyuan]].\n\nChern moved to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1960, where he worked and stayed until his retirement in 1979. In 1961, Chern became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same year, he was elected member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=\"Chern Berkeley\">{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/12/06_chern.shtml |title=Renowned mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern, who revitalized the study of geometry, has died at 93 in Tianjin, China |format=shtml |date=December 6, 2004 |author=Robert Sanders, Media Relations |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley|UC, Berkeley]] |accessdate=Aug 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Chern was a vice-president of [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS).\n\nChern retired from Berkeley in 1981. He founded the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI) in 1981 and served as the director until 1984. Afterward he became the honorary director of the institute. MSRI now is one of the largest and most prominent mathematical institutes in the world.<ref name=\"Chern Berkeley\"/> [[Shing-Tung Yau]] was one of his PhD students during this period.\n\n===Short visits to China===\n\nThe [[Shanghai Communiqué]] was issued by the United States and the People's Republic of China on February 27, 1972. The relationship between these two nations started to normalise, and American citizens were allowed to visit P.R.China. In September 1972, Chern visited Beijing with his wife.\nDuring this period of time, Chern visited China 25 times, of which 14 were to his home province Zhejiang.\n\nChern founded the Nankai Institute for Mathematics (NKIM) at his alma mater Nankai in Tianjin. The institute was formally established in 1984 and fully opened in October 17, 1985. NKIM was renamed the [[Chern Institute of Mathematics]] in 2004 after Chern's death.\n\n===Final years===\n\nBased on Chern's advice, a mathematical research center was established in [[Taipei]], Taiwan, whose co-operational partners are [[National Taiwan University]], [[National Tsing Hua University]] and the Sinica Academia Institute of Mathematics.<ref name=\"Chern TW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mathland.idv.tw/history/chen.html |title=陳省身 (Shiing-Shen Chern) |publisher=mathland.idv.tw |accessdate=Aug 22, 2010|language=zh}}</ref>\n\nChern was also a director and advisor of the [[Center of Mathematical Sciences, Zhejiang University|Center of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University]] in [[Hangzhou]], Zhejiang.\n\nFrom 2000 to his death, Chern lived in Tianjin, China. Chern died of heart failure at his home in Tianjin in 2004 at age 93.\n\n==Research==\nChern's work extends over all the classic fields of differential geometry. It includes areas currently fashionable (the [[Chern–Simons theory]] arising from a 1974 paper written jointly with [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]]), perennial (the [[Chern–Weil theory]] linking [[curvature]] invariants to [[characteristic class]]es from 1944, after the [[Carl B. Allendoerfer|Allendoerfer]]&ndash;[[André Weil|Weil]] paper of 1943 on the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]), the foundational ([[Chern class]]es), and some areas such as [[projective differential geometry]] and [[web (mathematics)|web]]s that have a lower profile. He published results in [[integral geometry]], [[value distribution theory of holomorphic functions]], and [[minimal submanifold]]s.\n\nHe was a follower of [[Élie Cartan]], working on the '[[theory of equivalence]]' in his time in China from 1937 to 1943, in relative isolation. In 1954 he published his own treatment of the [[pseudogroup]] problem that is in effect the touchstone of Cartan's geometric theory.  He used the [[moving frame]] method with success only matched by its inventor; he preferred in [[complex manifold]] theory to stay with the geometry, rather than follow the [[potential theory]].  Indeed, one of his books is entitled \"Complex Manifolds without Potential Theory\".  In the last years of his life, he advocated the study of [[Finsler geometry]], writing several books and articles on the subject.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n\nChern received numerous honors and awards in his life, including:\n* 1970, [[Chauvenet Prize]], of the Mathematical Association of America;\n* 1975, [[National Medal of Science]]<ref>[http://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=75 National Science Foundation – The President's National Medal of Science]</ref>\n* 1982, [[Humboldt Prize]], Germany;\n* 1983, [[Leroy P.

The unusual spelling \"Chern\" is a [[transliteration]] in the old [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] (GR) [[romanization]] for [[Mandarin Chinese]] used in the early twentieth century China. It uses special spelling rules to indicate different tones of Mandarin, which is a [[tonal language]] with four tones.  The silent ''r'' in \"Chern\" indicates a [[Standard Mandarin#Tones|second-tone]] syllable, written \"Chén\" in [[pinyin]] but in practice often written by non-Chinese without the tonal mark.   In GR the spelling of his given name \"Shiing-Shen\" indicates a third tone for ''Shiing'' and a first tone for ''Shen'', which are equivalent to the syllables \"Xǐngshēn\" in [[pinyin]].\n\nIn English, Chern pronounced his name \"Churn\", and this pronunciation is now universally accepted  among English-speaking mathematicians and physicists.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|Biography|Asian American}}\n*[[Chern classes]]\n*[[Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]\n*[[Chern–Simons theory]]\n*[[Chern–Simons form]]\n*[[Chern–Weil theory]]\n*[[Chern–Weil homomorphism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/12/06_chern.shtml UC Berkeley obituary]\n*[http://www.ams.org/notices/199807/chern.pdf 1998 interview in ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society'']\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=6424}}\n*{{MacTutor Biography|id=Chern}}\n*[http://www.intlpress.com/AJM/p/2006/10_1/AJM-10-1-v-xii-YauEssay.pdf Chern's Work in Geometry] by [[Shing-Tung Yau]]\n*[http://www.ams.org/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-08-01219-6/home.html Shiing-shen Chern: 1911–2004] by H.
