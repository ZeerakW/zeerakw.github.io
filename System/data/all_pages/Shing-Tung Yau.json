He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1982.\n\nYau's work is mainly in [[differential geometry]], especially in [[geometric analysis]]. His contributions have had an influence on both [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] and he has been active at the interface between [[geometry]] and [[theoretical physics]]. His proof of the [[positive energy theorem]] in [[general relativity]] demonstrated—sixty years after its discovery—that [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory is consistent and stable. His proof of the [[Calabi conjecture]] allowed physicists—using Calabi–Yau compactification—to show that string theory is a viable candidate for a [[unified theory]] of nature. [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]s are among the standard toolkit for [[string theorists]] today.\n\n==Biography==\nYau was born in [[Shantou]], [[Guangdong Province]], [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] with [[Hakka]] ancestry in [[Jiaoling]], [[Guangdong]] in a family of eight children. When he was only a few months old, his family emigrated to [[Hong Kong]], where they lived first in [[Yuen Long]] and then 5 years later in [[Shatin]]. When Yau was fourteen, his father Chiou Chenying, a philosophy professor, died.\n\nAfter graduating from [[Pui Ching Middle School (Hong Kong)|Pui Ching Middle School]], he studied mathematics at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] from 1966 to 1969. Yau went to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in the fall of 1969. At the age of 22, Yau was awarded the Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [[Shiing-Shen Chern]] at Berkeley in two years. He spent a year as a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton, New Jersey]], and two years at the [[Stony Brook University]]. Then he went to [[Stanford University]]. Yau has held American citizenship since 1990.<ref>Yau received American citizenship in 1990. The [[People's Republic of China]] does not recognize [[dual nationality]].</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Overbye |first=Dennis |title=Scientist at Work: Shing-Tung Yau The Emperor of Math  |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 17, 2006 |doi= |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/science/17yau.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |accessdate=September 14, 2013|quote= He became a United States citizen in 1990.}}</ref>\n\nSince 1987, he has been at [[Harvard University]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://math.harvard.edu/people/YauShing-Tung.html |title= Department of Mathematics faculty, Harvard University}}</ref> where he has had numerous Ph.D. students. He is also involved in the activities of research institutes in Hong Kong and China. He takes an interest in the state of primary and secondary mathematics education in China, and his criticisms of the Chinese education system, corruption in the academic world in China, and the quality of mathematical research and education, have been widely publicized.\n\n==Contributions to mathematics==\nDuong Hong Phong of [[Columbia University]] has commented on the influence of Yau's research in [[geometric analysis]].<ref name = CMS>[http://www.cms.zju.edu.cn/news.asp?id=1016&ColumnName=forum&Version=english Page at ''Center of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University'']</ref>\n\n===Work on conjectures===\n\n====Calabi conjecture====\n{{details|Calabi conjecture}}\nYau's solution of the [[Calabi conjecture]], concerning the existence of an [[Einstein–Kähler metric]], has far-reaching consequences. The existence of such a canonical unique metric allows one to give explicit representatives of [[characteristic classes]]. [[Calabi–Yau manifolds]] are now fundamental in [[string theory]], where the Calabi conjecture provides an essential piece in the model.\n\nIn [[algebraic geometry]], the Calabi conjecture implies the [[Miyaoka–Yau inequality]] on [[Chern number]]s of surfaces, a characterization of the [[complex projective plane]] and quotients of the two-dimensional [[Unit sphere|complex unit ball]], an important class of [[Shimura varieties]].\n\nYau also made a contribution in the case that the first Chern number ''c''<sub>1</sub> > 0, and conjectured its relation to the stability in the sense of [[geometric invariant theory]] in algebraic geometry. This has motivated the work of [[Simon Donaldson]] on [[scalar curvature]] and stability. Another important result of Donaldson–Uhlenbeck–Yau is that a [[holomorphic vector bundle]] is stable (in the sense of [[David Mumford]]) if and only if there exists an Hermitian–Yang–Mills metric on it. This has many consequences in algebraic geometry, for example, the characterization of certain [[symmetric spaces]], Chern number inequalities for stable bundles, and the restriction of the [[fundamental groups]] of a [[Kähler manifold]].\n\n====Positive mass conjecture and existence of black holes====\n{{details|Positive energy theorem}}\nYau pioneered the method of using [[minimal surface]]s to study geometry and [[topology]]. By an analysis of how minimal surfaces behave in [[space-time]], Yau and [[Richard Schoen]] proved the long-standing conjecture that the total mass in [[general relativity]] is positive.\n\nThis theorem implies that flat space-time is stable, a fundamental issue for the theory of general relativity. Briefly, the positive mass conjecture says that if a [[three-dimensional manifold]] has positive [[scalar curvature]] and is [[asymptotically flat]], then a constant that appears in the [[asymptotic expansion]] of the metric is positive. A continuation of the above work gives another result in relativity proved by Yau, an [[existence theorem]] for [[black holes]]. Yau and Schoen continued their work on [[manifolds]] with positive [[scalar curvature]], which led to Schoen's final solution of the [[Yamabe problem]].\n\n====Smith conjecture====\n{{details|Smith conjecture}}\nYau and William H. Meeks solved the well-known question whether the Douglas solution of a minimal disk for an external [[Jordan curve]], the [[Plateau problem]], in three space, is always embedded if the boundary curve is a subset of a [[convex set|convex]] boundary. They then went on to prove that these embedded [[minimal surfaces]] are equivariant for finite [[group actions]]. Combining this work with a result of [[William Thurston]], [[Cameron Gordon (mathematician)|Cameron Gordon]] assembled a proof of the [[Smith conjecture]]: for any [[cyclic group]] acting on a sphere, the set of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s is not a knotted curve.\n\n====Hermitian Yang–Mills connection and stable vector bundles====\nYau and [[Karen Uhlenbeck]] proved the existence and uniqueness of Hermitian–Einstein metrics (or equivalently Hermitian Yang–Mills connections) for stable bundles on any compact Kähler manifold, extending an earlier result of Donaldson for projective [[algebraic surfaces]], and [[M. S. Narasimhan]] and [[C. S. Seshadri]] for algebraic curves. Both the results and methods of this paper have been influential in parts of both algebraic geometry and string theory. This result is now usually called the Donaldson–Uhlenbeck–Yau Theorem.\n\n====Frankel conjecture====\nYau and [[Yum-Tong Siu]] proved the 1981 Frankel conjecture in [[complex geometry]], stating that any compact positively curved [[Kähler manifold]] is [[biholomorphic]] to [[complex projective space]]. An independent proof was given by [[Shigefumi Mori]], using methods of [[algebraic geometry]] in [[positive characteristic]].\n\n====Mirror conjecture====\nWith Bong Lian and [[Kefeng Liu]], Yau proved the mirror formulas conjectured by string theorists. These formulas give the explicit numbers of [[rational curve]]s of all [[degree of an algebraic variety|degrees]] in a large class of Calabi–Yau manifolds, in terms of the [[Picard–Fuchs equation]]s of the corresponding [[mirror manifold]]s. Givental had earlier sketched a proof of the mirror formulas in a paper on \"Equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants\" (Internat. Math. Res. Notices 1996), but his argument contained substantial gaps and wrong arguments. Some of these were fixed and new key ideas were added to give a complete proof in the paper by Lian-Liu-Yau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctoryau.com/papers/MirrorConjectureResponse.pdf |title= On the Mirror Conjecture}}</ref>\n\n=== New methods and concepts ===\n\n==== Gradient estimates and Harnack inequalities====\nYau developed the method of gradient estimates for [[Harnack's inequalities]]. This method has been used and refined by him and other people to attack for example, bounds on the [[heat kernel]]. Early in 1981, Yau suggested to [[Richard Hamilton (mathematician)|Richard Hamilton]] that he use the [[Ricci flow]] to realize naturally the [[canonical decomposition]] of a [[three-dimensional manifold]] into pieces, each of which has a [[geometric structure]], in the [[Geometrization conjecture|Thurston program]]. Hamilton amplified their results, to what is now called the Li–Yau–Hamilton inequality for the Ricci flow equations.\n\nGradient estimates were also used crucially in Yau's joint work with S. Y. Cheng to give a complete proof of the [[Dimension|higher-dimensional]] [[Hermann Minkowski]] problem and the [[Dirichlet problem]] for the real [[Monge–Ampère equation]], and other results on the Kähler–Einstein metric of bounded [[pseudoconvex domain]]s.\n\n====Uniformization of complex manifolds====\nWhen Yau was a graduate student, he started to generalize the [[uniformization theorem]] of [[Riemann surfaces]] to higher-dimensional complex [[Kähler manifold]]s. For a [[compact manifold]] with positive bisectional curvature, the Frankel conjecture proved by Siu and Yau, and independently by Mori, shows that it is [[complex projective space]]. Yau proposed a series of conjectures when the manifold is non-compact, and made contributions towards their solutions. For example, when the bisectional curvature is positive, it must be [[biholomorphic]] to ''C''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\n====Harmonic maps and rigidity====\n\nWhen Yau was working on his thesis about manifolds with [[non-positive curvature]] and their [[fundamental groups]], he realized that it is possible to use [[harmonic map]]s to give alternative proofs of some results there. He was aware of the [[Mostow rigidity theorem]] for [[locally symmetric space]]s, which was used by him to prove the uniqueness of [[Complex manifold|complex structure]] of quotients of complex balls. He proposed that harmonic maps be used to prove rigidity of the complex structure for Kähler manifolds with strongly [[negative curvature]], a program that was successfully carried out by [[Yum-Tong Siu]]. This method, the so-called Siu-Yau method, has been extended to prove strong and super-rigidities of many locally symmetric spaces.\n\n====Minimal submanifolds====\n\n[[Minimal submanifold]]s have been used by Yau in the solutions of the [[Positive Mass Conjecture]], the [[Smith conjecture]], the Frankel conjecture, and else. Many people others have since applied minimal surfaces to other problems. [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]]'s introduction of pseudo-holomorphic curves in [[symplectic geometry]] has also had an important impact on that field.\n\n===Open problems===\nYau has compiled an influential set of [[open problems]] in [[geometry]].\n\n====Harmonic functions with controlled growth====\nOne of Yau’s problems is about bounded [[harmonic function]]s, and harmonic functions on noncompact manifolds of [[polynomial]] growth. After proving non-existence of bounded harmonic functions on manifolds with [[Constant curvature|positive curvatures]], he proposed the [[Dirichlet problem]] at [[Infinity#Mathematics|infinity]] for bounded harmonic functions on negatively curved manifolds, and then proceeded to harmonic functions of polynomial growth. [[Dennis Sullivan]] tells a story about Yau's geometric intuition, and how it led him to reject an analytical proof of Sullivan's. [[Michael Anderson (differential geometer)|Michael Anderson]] independently found the same result about bounded harmonic function on simply connected negatively curved manifolds using a geometric convexity construction.<ref name = CMS/>\n\n====Rank rigidity of nonpositively curved manifolds====\nAgain motivated by Mostow's strong rigidity theorem, Yau called for a notion of [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] for general manifolds extending the one for locally symmetric spaces, and asked for [[Rigidity (mathematics)|rigidity]] properties for higher rank [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]]. Advances in this direction have been made by [[Hans Werner Ballmann|Ballmann]], Brin and Eberlein in their work on [[Non-positive curvature|non-positive curved]] manifolds, Gromov's and Eberlein's metric rigidity theorems for higher rank locally symmetric spaces and the classification of closed higher rank manifolds of non-positive curvature by Ballmann and Burns-Spatzier. This leaves rank 1 manifolds of non-positive curvature as the focus of research. They behave more like manifolds of [[negative curvature]], but remain poorly understood in many regards.\n\n====Kähler–Einstein metrics and stability of manifolds====\nIt is known that if a [[complex manifold]] has a [[Kähler–Einstein metric]], then its [[tangent bundle]] is stable. Yau realized early in 1980s that the existence of special [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] on [[Kähler manifolds]] is equivalent to the stability of the [[manifolds]]. Various people including [[Simon Donaldson]] have made progress to understand such a relation.\n\n====Mirror symmetry====\n\nHe has collaborated with string theorists including [[Andrew Strominger|Strominger]], [[Cumrun Vafa|Vafa]] and [[Edward Witten|Witten]], and as post-doctorals from theoretical physics with [[Brian Greene|B. Greene]], [[Eric Zaslow|E. Zaslow]] and A. Klemm . The [[Strominger–Yau–Zaslow program]] is to construct explicitly [[Mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror manifolds]]. David Gieseker wrote of the seminal role of the Calabi conjecture in relating string theory with algebraic geometry, in particular for the developments of the SYZ program, mirror conjecture and Yau–Zaslow conjecture.<ref name = CMS/>\n\n==Initiatives in mainland China and Taiwan==\nYau was born in China but grew up in Hong Kong. After [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|the door of China was opened to the west in the late 1970s]], Yau revisited China in 1979 on the invitation of [[Hua Luogeng]].\n\nTo help develop Chinese mathematics, Yau started by educating students from China, then establishing mathematics research institutes and centers, organizing conferences at all levels, initiating out-reach programs, and raising private funds for these purposes. [[John H. Coates|John Coates]] has commented on Yau's success as fundraiser.<ref name = CMS/> The first of Yau's initiatives is The Institute of Mathematical Sciences at [[Chinese University of Hong Kong|The Chinese University of Hong Kong]] in 1993. The goal is to “organize activities related to a broad variety of fields including both pure and Applied mathematics, [[Computational science|scientific computation]], [[image processing]], [[mathematical physics]] and [[statistics]]. The emphasis is on interaction and linkages with the [[physical sciences]], [[engineering]], [[industry]] and [[commerce]].”\n\nThe second one is the Morningside Center of Mathematics in Beijing, established in 1996. Part of the money for the building and regular operations was raised by Yau from the Morningside Foundation in Hong Kong. Yau proposed organizing the International Congress of Chinese Mathematicians, now held every three years. The first congress was held at the Morningside Center from December 12 to 18, 1998. The third is the Center of Mathematical Sciences at [[Zhejiang University]]. It was established in 2002. Yau is the director of all these three math institutes and visits them on a regular basis.\n\nYau went to [[Taiwan]] to attend a conference in 1985. In 1990, he was invited by Dr. C.-S. Liu, then the President of [[National Tsing Hua University|National Tsinghua University]], to visit the university for a year. A few years later, he convinced Liu, by then the chairman of [[National Science Council]], to create the National Center of Theoretical Sciences (NCTS), which was established at [[Hsinchu]] in 1998. He was the chairman of the Advisory Board of the NCTS until 2005 and was followed by H. T. Yau of Harvard University.\n\n==Outreach==\nHis classmate at college Y.-C.Siu speaks of Yau as an ambassador of mathematics.<ref name = CMS/> In Hong Kong, with the support of [[Ronnie Chan]], Yau set up the Hang Lung Award for high school students. He has also organized and participated in meetings for high school and college students, for example, the panel discussions ''Why Math? Ask Masters!'' in [[Hangzhou]], July 2004, and ''The Wonder of Mathematics'' in Hong Kong, December 2004. Yau organized the JDG conference surveying developments in geometry and related fields, and the annual Current development of mathematics conference. Yau also co-initiated a series of books on popular mathematics, \"Mathematics and Mathematical People\".\n\n==Honors and awards==\nYau has received numerous honors and awards in his life,<ref name=\"Yau ho & aw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cirs-tm.org/researchers/researchers.php?id=350 |title=YAU, SHING-TUNG |format=php |publisher=International Center for Scientific Research |accessdate=Jan 1, 2009}}</ref> including:\n\n===Prizes and awards===\n* 1979, California Scientist of the Year.\n* 1981, [[Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry]].\n* 1981, [[John J.
