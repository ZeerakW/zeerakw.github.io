He is currently  a permanent member of the [[Simons Center for Geometry and Physics]] at [[Stony Brook University]]<ref name=\"scgp.stonybrook.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://scgp.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/bios/simon-donaldson|title=Simon Donaldson, Simons Center for Geometry and Physics}}</ref> and a Professor in Pure Mathematics at [[Imperial College London]].\n\n== Biography ==\nDonaldson's father was an electrical engineer in the physiology department at the [[University of Cambridge]], and his mother earned a science degree there.<ref>[http://www.shawprize.org/en/shaw.php?tmp=3&twoid=12&threeid=41&fourid=22&fiveid=11 Simon Donaldson Autobiography, The Shaw Prize, 2009]</ref> Donaldson gained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[mathematics]] from [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] in 1979, and in 1980 began postgraduate work at [[Worcester College, Oxford]], at first under [[Nigel Hitchin]] and later under [[Michael Atiyah]]'s supervision. Still a postgraduate student, Donaldson proved in 1982 a result that would establish his fame. He published the result in a paper ''Self-dual connections and the topology of smooth 4-manifolds'' which appeared in 1983. In the words of Atiyah, the paper \"stunned the mathematical world\" (Atiyah 1986).\n\nWhereas [[Michael Freedman]] classified topological four-manifolds, Donaldson's work focused on four-manifolds admitting a [[differentiable structure]], using [[instantons]], a particular solution to the equations of [[Yang–Mills]] [[gauge theory]] which has its origin in [[quantum field theory]]. One of Donaldson's first results gave severe restrictions on the [[Intersection form (4-manifold)|intersection form]] of a smooth four-manifold. As a consequence, a large class of the topological four-manifolds do not admit any [[smooth structure]] at all. Donaldson also derived polynomial invariants from [[gauge theory]]. These were new topological invariants sensitive to the underlying smooth structure of the four-manifold. They made it possible to deduce the existence of \"exotic\" smooth structures—certain topological four-manifolds could carry an infinite family of different smooth structures.\n\nAfter gaining his [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] degree from [[Oxford University]] in 1983, Donaldson was appointed a Junior Research Fellow at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], he spent the academic year 1983&ndash;84 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], and returned to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] as [[Wallis Professor of Mathematics]] in 1985. After spending one year visiting [[Stanford University]],<ref>[http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/d/1854/Simon+Kirwan.aspx Biography at DeBretts]</ref> he moved to [[Imperial College London]] in 1998.\n\nIn 2014, he joined the [[Simons Center for Geometry and Physics]] at [[Stony Brook University]] in [[New York]], [[USA]].<ref name=\"scgp.stonybrook.edu\"/>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nDonaldson received the [[Junior Whitehead Prize]] from the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 1985 and in the following year he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and, also in 1986, he received a [[Fields Medal]]. He was awarded the 1994 [[Crafoord Prize]].\n\nIn February 2006, Donaldson was awarded the King Faisal International Prize for science for his work in pure mathematical theories linked to physics, which have helped in forming an understanding of the laws of matter at a subnuclear level.\n\nIn April 2008, he was awarded the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]], a mathematics prize awarded by [[Northwestern University]].\n\nIn 2009 he was awarded the [[Shaw Prize]] in Mathematics (jointly with [[Clifford Taubes]]) for their contributions to geometry in 3 and 4 dimensions.\n\nIn 2010, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=\"kva\">[http://www.kva.se/en/News/2010/New-foreign-members-elected-to-the-academy/ New foreign members elected to the academy], press announcement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2010-05-26</ref>\n\nDonaldson was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 2012 [[New Year Honours]] for services to mathematics.<ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=60009 |date=31 December 2011 |startpage=1 |supp=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2012-11-10.</ref>\n\nIn March 2014, he was awarded an honorary degree \"Docteur Honoris Causa\" by [[Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble]].\n\nIn 2014 he was awarded the [[Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics]] \"for the new revolutionary invariants of 4-dimensional manifolds and for the study of the relation between stability in algebraic geometry and in global differential geometry, both for bundles and for Fano varieties.\"<ref>[https://breakthroughprize.org/?controller=Page&action=news&news_id=18], retrieved 2014-06-26.</ref>\n\n==Donaldson's work==\nDonaldson's work is on the application of [[mathematical analysis]] (especially the analysis of elliptic [[partial differential equations]]) to problems in geometry. The problems mainly concern [[4-manifold]]s, complex [[differential geometry]] and [[symplectic geometry]]. The following theorems have been mentioned:\n\n* The diagonalizability theorem {{harvs|last=Donaldson|year1=1983a|year2=1983b|year3=1987a}}: If the [[intersection theory|intersection form]] of a smooth, closed, simply connected [[4-manifold]] is positive- or negative-definite then it is diagonalizable over the integers. This result is sometimes called [[Donaldson's theorem]].\n\n* A smooth [[h-cobordism]] between simply connected 4-manifolds need not be trivial {{harv|Donaldson|1987b}}. This contrasts with the situation in higher dimensions.\n\n* A stable [[holomorphic vector bundle]] over a non-singular projective [[algebraic variety]]  admits a [[Hermitian–Einstein metric]] {{harv|Donaldson|1987c}}. (Another proof of a somewhat more general result was given by {{harvtxt|Uhlenbeck|Yau|1986}}.)\n\n* A non-singular, projective algebraic surface can be diffeomorphic to the connected sum of two oriented 4-manifolds only if one of them has negative-definite intersection form {{harv|Donaldson|1990}}. This was an early application of the [[Donaldson invariant]] (or [[instanton]] invariants).\n\n* Any compact symplectic manifold admits a symplectic [[Lefschetz pencil]] {{harv|Donaldson|1999}}.\n\nDonaldson's recent work centers on a problem in complex differential geometry concerning a conjectural relationship between algebro-geometric \"stability\" conditions for smooth projective varieties and the existence of \"extremal\" [[Kähler manifold|Kähler metrics]], typically those with constant [[scalar curvature]] (see for example [[cscK metric]]). Donaldson obtained results in the toric case of the problem (see for example {{harvtxt|Donaldson|2001}}). He then solved the Kähler-Einstein case of the problem in 2012, in collaboration with Chen and Sun. This last spectacular achievement involved a number of difficult and technical papers. The first of these was the paper of {{harvtxt|Donaldson|Sun|2014}} on Gromov-Hausdorff limits. The summary of the existence proof for Kähler-Einstein metrics appears in {{harvtxt|Chen|Donaldson|Sun|2014}}. Full details of the proofs appear in {{harvs|txt|last1=Chen|last2=Donaldson|last3=Sun|year1=2015a|year2=2015b|year3=2015c}}. \n\nSee also [[Donaldson theory]].\n\n==Selected publications==\n*{{Cite journal |last=Donaldson |first=Simon K. |title=An application of gauge theory to four-dimensional topology |journal=[[J.
