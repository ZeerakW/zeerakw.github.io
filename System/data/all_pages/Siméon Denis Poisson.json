He obtained many important results, but within the elite [[Académie des Sciences]] he also was the final leading opponent of the [[wave theory of light]] and was proven wrong on that matter by [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]].\n\n==Biography==\nPoisson was born in [[Pithiviers]], [[Loiret]], the son of soldier Siméon Poisson.\n\nIn 1798, he entered the [[École Polytechnique]] in [[Paris]] as first in his year, and immediately began to attract the notice of the professors of the school, who left him free to make his own decisions as to what he would study. In 1800, less than two years after his entry, he published two memoirs, one on [[Étienne Bézout]]'s method of elimination, the other on the number of [[integral]]s of a [[finite difference]] equation. The latter was examined by [[Sylvestre Lacroix|Sylvestre-François Lacroix]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]], who recommended that it should be published in the ''Recueil des savants étrangers,'' an unprecedented honour for a youth of eighteen. This success at once procured entry for Poisson into scientific circles. [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], whose lectures on the theory of functions he attended at the École Polytechnique, recognized his talent early on, and became his friend (the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]] lists Lagrange as his advisor, but this may be an approximation); while [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], in whose footsteps Poisson followed, regarded him almost as his son. The rest of his career, till his death in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]] near Paris, was nearly occupied by the composition and publication of his many works and in fulfilling the duties of the numerous educational positions to which he was successively appointed.\n\nImmediately after finishing his studies at the École Polytechnique, he was appointed ''[[répétiteur]]'' (teaching assistant) there, a position which he had occupied as an amateur while still a pupil in the school; for his schoolmates had made a custom of visiting him in his room after an unusually difficult lecture to hear him repeat and explain it. He was made deputy professor (''professeur suppléant'') in 1802, and, in 1806 full professor succeeding [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier]], whom [[Napoleon]] had sent to [[Grenoble]]. In 1808 he became [[astronomer]] to the [[Bureau des Longitudes]]; and when the [[Faculte des Sciences|Faculté des Sciences]] was instituted in 1809 he was appointed professor of [[rational mechanics]] (''professeur de mécanique rationelle''). He went on to become a member of the Institute in 1812, examiner at the military school (''École Militaire'') at [[École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] in 1815, graduation examiner at the École Polytechnique in 1816, councillor of the university in 1820, and geometer to the Bureau des Longitudes succeeding Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1827.\n\nIn 1817, he married Nancy de Bardi and with her he had four children. His father, whose early experiences had led him to hate aristocrats, bred him in the stern creed of the First Republic. Throughout the Revolution, the Empire, and the following restoration, Poisson was not interested in politics, concentrating on mathematics. He was appointed to the dignity of [[baron]] in 1821; but he neither took out the diploma or used the title. In March 1818, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27poisson%27%29|title= Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate= 4 October 2010}}</ref> and in 1823 a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. The [[July Revolution|revolution of July 1830]] threatened him with the loss of all his honours; but this disgrace to the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] was adroitly averted by [[François Jean Dominique Arago]], who, while his \"revocation\" was being plotted by the council of ministers, procured him an invitation to dine at the Palais Royal, where he was openly and effusively received by the citizen king, who \"remembered\" him. After this, of course, his degradation was impossible, and seven years later he was made a [[peer of France]], not for political reasons, but as a representative of French [[science]].\n\nAs a teacher of mathematics Poisson is said to have been extraordinarily successful, as might have been expected from his early promise as a ''répétiteur'' at the École Polytechnique. As a scientific worker, his productivity has rarely if ever been equalled. Notwithstanding his many official duties, he found time to publish more than three hundred works, several of them extensive treatises, and many of them memoirs dealing with the most abstruse branches of pure mathematics, [[applied mathematics]], [[mathematical physics]], and rational mechanics.  ([[François Arago|Arago]] attributed to him the quote, \"Life is good for only two things:  doing mathematics and teaching it.\"<ref>[[François Arago]] (1786–1853) attributed to Poisson the quote:  \"La vie n'est bonne qu'à deux choses:  à faire des mathématiques et à les professer.\" (Life is good for only two things:  to do mathematics and to teach it.)  See:  J.-A. Barral, ed., ''Oeuvres complétes de François Arago ...'', vol. II (Paris, France:  Gide et J. Baudry, 1854), [http://books.google.com/books?id=MRIPAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA662#v=onepage&q&f=false page 662].</ref>)\n\nA list of Poisson's works, drawn up by himself, is given at the end of Arago's biography. All that is possible is a brief mention of the more important ones. It was in the application of mathematics to physics that his greatest services to science were performed. Perhaps the most original, and certainly the most permanent in their influence, were his memoirs on the theory of [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], which virtually created a new branch of mathematical physics.\n\nNext (or in the opinion of some, first) in importance stand the memoirs on [[celestial dynamics|celestial mechanics]], in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs ''Sur les inégalités séculaires des moyens mouvements des planètes'', ''Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de mécanique'', both published in the ''Journal'' of the École Polytechnique (1809); ''Sur la libration de la lune'', in ''Connaissances des temps'' (1821), etc.; and ''Sur le mouvement de la terre autour de son centre de gravité'', in ''Mémoires de l'Académie'' (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary [[orbit]]s, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that the result could be extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in [[planetary theory]]. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled ''Sur la théorie des variations des éléments des planètes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites''. So highly did he think of Poisson's memoir that he made a copy of it with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.\n\nHis name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].\n\n==Contributions==\n[[File:Poisson - Mémoire sur le calcul numerique des integrales définies, 1826 - 744791.tif|thumb|''Mémoire sur le calcul numerique des integrales définies'', 1826]]\nPoisson's well-known correction of Laplace's second order [[partial differential equation]] for [[potential]]:\n\n: <math> \\nabla^2 \\phi = - 4 \\pi \\rho \\; </math>\n\ntoday named after him [[Poisson's equation]] or the [[potential theory]] equation, was first published in the ''Bulletin de la société philomatique'' (1813). If a function of a given point ρ = 0, we get [[Laplace's equation]]:\n\n: <math> \\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\;  .</math>\n\nIn 1812 Poisson discovered that Laplace's equation is valid only outside of a solid. A rigorous proof for masses with variable density was first given by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1839. Both equations have their equivalents in [[vector calculus|vector algebra]]. Poisson's equation for the [[Laplace operator|divergence of the gradient]] of a [[scalar field]], φ in 3-dimensional space is:\n\n: <math> \\nabla^2 \\phi = \\rho (x, y, z) \\; .</math>\n\nConsider for instance Poisson's equation for surface [[electrical potential]], Ψ as a function of the density of [[electrical charge|electric charge]], ρ<sub>e</sub> at a particular point:\n\n: <math> \\nabla^2 \\Psi = {\\partial ^2 \\Psi\\over \\partial x^2 } +\n                     {\\partial ^2 \\Psi\\over \\partial y^2 } +\n                     {\\partial ^2 \\Psi\\over \\partial z^2 } =\n                     - {\\rho_{e} \\over \\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0}} \\;  .</math>\n\nThe distribution of a charge in a [[fluid]] is unknown and we have to use the [[Poisson–Boltzmann equation]]:\n\n:<math> \\nabla^2 \\Psi = {n_{0} e \\over \\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0}}\n     \\left( e^{e\\Psi (x,y,z)/k_{B}T} -\n            e^{-e\\Psi (x,y,z)/ k_{B}T} \\right), \\; </math>\n\nwhich in most cases cannot be solved analytically. In [[coordinates (elementary mathematics)|polar coordinate]]s the Poisson–Boltzmann equation is:\n\n:<math> {1\\over r^{2}} {d\\over dr} \\left( r^{2} {d\\Psi \\over dr} \\right) =\n     {n_{0} e \\over \\varepsilon \\varepsilon_{0}}\n     \\left( e^{e\\Psi (r) / k_{B}T} - e^{-e\\Psi (r) / k_B T} \\right) \\;  </math>\n\nwhich also cannot be solved analytically. If a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], φ is not [[scalar field|scalar]], the  Poisson equation is valid, as can be for example in 4-dimensional [[Minkowski space]]:\n\n:<math> \\sqrt \\phi_{ik} = \\rho (x, y, z, ct) \\; . </math>\n\nIf ρ(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') is a [[continuous function]] and if for ''r''→ ∞ (or if a point 'moves' to [[Extended real number line|infinity]]) a function φ goes to 0 fast enough, a solution of Poisson's equation is the [[Newtonian potential]] of a function ρ(''x'', ''y'', ''z''):\n\n:<math> \\phi_M = - {1\\over 4 \\pi} \\int {\\rho (x, y, z)\\, dv \\over r} \\; </math>\n\nwhere ''r'' is a distance between a volume element ''dv'' and a point ''M''. The integration runs over the whole space.\n\nAnother \"Poisson's integral\" is the solution for the [[Green's function|Green function]] for Laplace's equation with Dirichlet condition over a circular disk:\n\n:<math> \\phi(\\xi \\eta) = {1\\over 4 \\pi} \\int _0^{2\\pi}\n     {R^2 - \\rho^2\\over R^2 + \\rho^2 - 2R \\rho \\cos (\\psi - \\chi) } \\phi\n     (\\chi)\\, d \\chi \\;  </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> \\xi = \\rho \\cos \\psi, \\; </math>\n\n:<math>\\quad \\eta = \\rho \\sin \\psi, \\;  </math>\n\n:φ is a boundary condition holding on the disk's boundary.\n\nIn the same manner, we define the Green function for the Laplace equation with Dirichlet condition, ∇² φ = 0 over a sphere of radius ''R''. This time the Green function is:\n\n:<math> G(x,y,z;\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta) = {1\\over r} - {R\\over r_1 \\rho} \\; , </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> \\rho = \\sqrt {\\xi^2 + \\eta^2 + \\zeta^2} </math> is the distance of a point (ξ, η, ζ) from the center of a sphere,\n\n''r'' is the distance between points (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') and (ξ, η, ζ), and\n\n''r''<sub>1</sub> is the distance between the point (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') and the point (''R''ξ/ρ, ''R''η/ρ, ''R''ζ/ρ), symmetrical to the point (ξ, η, ζ).\n\nPoisson's integral now has a form:\n\n:<math> \\phi(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta) = {1\\over 4 \\pi} \\iint_S {R^2 - \n        \\rho^2 \\over R r^3} \\phi\\, ds \\; . </math>\n\nPoisson's two most important memoirs on the subject are ''Sur l'attraction des sphéroides'' (Connaiss. ft. temps, 1829), and ''Sur l'attraction d'un ellipsoide homogène'' (Mim. ft. l'acad., 1835). In concluding our selection from his physical memoirs, we may mention his memoir on the theory of waves (Mém. ft. l'acad., 1825).\n\nIn [[pure mathematics]], his most important works were his series of memoirs on [[definite integral]]s and his discussion of [[Fourier series]], the latter paving the way for the classic researches of [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]] on the same subject; these are to be found in the ''Journal'' of the École Polytechnique from 1813 to 1823, and in the ''Memoirs de l'Académie'' for 1823. He also studied [[Fourier integral]]s. We may also mention his essay on the [[calculus of variations]] (''Mem. de l'acad.,'' 1833), and his memoirs on the probability of the mean results of observations (''Connaiss. d. temps,'' 1827, &c). The [[Poisson distribution]] in [[probability theory]] is named after him.\n\nIn his ''Traité de mécanique'' (2 vols. 8vo, 1811 arid 1833), which was written in the style of Laplace and Lagrange and was long a standard work, he showed many novelties such as an explicit usage of [[momentum|momenta]]:\n\n:<math> p_i = {\\partial T\\over {\\partial q_i/\\partial t}},</math>\n\nwhich influenced the work of [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] and [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]].\n\nBesides his many memoirs, Poisson published a number of treatises, most of which were intended to form part of a great work on mathematical physics, which he did not live to complete. Among these may be mentioned\n* ''Nouvelle théorie de l'action capillaire'' (4to, 1831);\n* ''Théorie mathématique de la chaleur'' (4to, 1835);\n* Supplement to the same (4to, 1837);\n* ''Recherches sur la probabilité des jugements en matières criminelles et matière civile'' (4to, 1837), all published at Paris.\nA translation of Poisson's [http://books.google.com/books?id=lksn7QwUZsQC&dq=Poisson+mechanics&as_brr=1&hl=en Treatise on Mechanics] was published in London in 1842.\n\nIn 1815 Poisson studied integrations along paths in the complex plane. In 1831 he derived the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] independently of [[Claude-Louis Navier]].\n\n==Flawed views on the wave theory of light==\nPoisson showed surprising hubris on the [[wave theory of light]]. He was a member of the academic \"old guard\" at the [[Académie royale des sciences de l'Institut de France]], who were staunch believers in the [[particle theory of light]] who were alarmed at the wave theory of light's increasing acceptance. In 1818, the Académie set their prize as [[diffraction]], being certain that a particle theorist would win it. Poisson, relying on intuition rather than mathematics or scientific experiment, ridiculed participant and civil engineer [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] when he submitted a thesis explaining diffraction derived from analysis of both the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]] and [[Young's double slit experiment]].<ref name=\"fresnel1868\">{{Citation| last=Fresnel| first=A.J.| year=1868| title=OEuvres Completes 1| publisher=Imprimerie impériale| publication-place=Paris| url=http://books.google.com/books/about/%C5%92uvres_compl%C3%A8tes_d_Augustin_Fresnel_Th.html?id=3QgAAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\nPoisson studied Fresnel's theory in detail and of course looked for a way to prove it wrong, as he was a dogmatic supporter of the particle-theory of light. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he argued that a consequence of Fresnel's theory was that there would exist an on-axis bright spot in the shadow of a circular obstacle blocking a [[point source]] of light, where there should be complete darkness according to the particle-theory of light. Fresnel's theory could not be true, Poisson declared, surely this result was absurd. (The Poisson spot is not easily observed in everyday situations, because most everyday sources of light are not good point sources.)\n\nHowever, the head of the committee, [[François Arago|Dominique-François-Jean Arago]], who incidentally later became Prime Minister of France, did not have the hubris of Poisson and decided it was necessary to perform the experiment in more detail. He molded a 2mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax.<ref name=\"fresnel1868_arago\">{{Citation| last=Fresnel| first=A.J.| year=1868| title=OEuvres Completes 1| publisher=Imprimerie impériale| publication-place=Paris| page=369| url=http://books.google.com/books/about/%C5%92uvres_compl%C3%A8tes_d_Augustin_Fresnel_Th.html?id=3QgAAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> To everyone's surprise he succeeded in observing the predicted spot, which convinced most scientists of the wave-nature of light. In the end Fresnel won the competition, much to Poisson's chagrin.\n\nAfter that, the corpuscular theory of light was vanquished, not to be heard of again until in a very different form, the 20th century revived it as the newly developed [[wave-particle duality]]. Arago later noted that the diffraction bright spot (which later became known as both the [[Arago spot]] and the Poisson spot) had already been observed by [[Joseph-Nicolas Delisle]]<ref name=\"fresnel1868_arago\"/> and [[Giacomo F.
