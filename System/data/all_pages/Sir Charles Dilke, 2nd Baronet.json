Touted as a future prime minister, his aspirations to higher political office were effectively terminated in 1885, after a notorious and well-publicised divorce case.\n\n==Background and education==\nDilke was the son of [[Sir Charles Dilke, 1st Baronet]]. He was educated at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], where he was President of the [[Cambridge Union Society]].<ref>{{acad|id=DLK862CW|name=Dilke, Charles}}</ref> His second wife was the author, art historian, feminist and trade unionist [[Emilia Frances Dilke|Emily Francis Pattison]] née Strong (widow of the Revd [[Mark Pattison (academic)|Mark Pattison]]), subsequently known as Lady Dilke.<ref>[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/dilkee.htm''Dictionary of Art historians'': \"Emilia, Lady Dilke\"]</ref>\n\nDespite being a radical, Dilke was also an imperialist, arguing for British imperial domination in his best-selling 1868\nbook ''Greater Britain''.<ref name=\"tmc\">Thomas M. Costa,\n\"Dilke, Charles Wentworth\" in\n''Historical Dictionary of the British Empire'' edited by James S. Olson and Robert Shadle. Greenwood Press, 1996 ISBN 0-313-27917-9</ref>\n\n==Political career, 1868–1886==\n[[File:Sir-Charles-Dilke.png|150px|left|Sir Charles Dilke.]]\nDilke became [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Chelsea (UK Parliament constituency)|Chelsea]] in 1868, a seat he held until 1885.\n\nIn 1871, Dilke caused controversy when he criticised the [[British Monarchy]] and\nargued that the United Kingdom should adopt a [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican]]\nform of government; public criticism made Dilke recant this position.<ref name=\"tmc\" />\n\nHe was [[Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]] from 1880 to 1882 during [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s second government and was admitted to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] in 1882. In December 1882 he entered the cabinet as [[President of the Local Government Board]], serving until 1885. A leading and determined radical within the Liberal party, he negotiated the passage of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act]], which the Conservatives allowed through the House of Lords in return for a [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|redistribution calculated to be marginally favourable to themselves]] (the granting of the vote to agricultural labourers threatened Conservative dominance of rural seats, but in return many double-member seats were abolished and seats redistributed to suburbia, where Conservative support was growing). He also supported laws giving the municipal [[Suffrage|franchise]] to women, legalising labour unions, improving working conditions and limiting working hours, as well as being one of the earliest campaigners for universal schooling.\n\n==The Crawford scandal==\n[[File:Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, 2nd Bt by George Frederic Watts.jpg|right|thumb|Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, 2nd Baronet, by [[George Frederic Watts]]]]\nDilke's younger brother [[Ashton Wentworth Dilke]] married May Eustace Smith, the eldest daughter of Liberal politician and shipowner [[Thomas Eustace Smith]] and his wife Ellen in 1876. Sir Charles Dilke became Ellen's lover, a relationship which continued after his marriage in 1884. In July 1885, however, he was accused of seducing the Eustace Smiths' daughter Virginia in the first year of her marriage to [[Donald Crawford]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]. This was supposed to have occurred in 1882 when Virginia was 19, and she claimed that the affair had continued on an irregular basis for the next two and a half years.\n\nCrawford sued for divorce, and the case was heard on 12 February 1886 before [[Charles Parker Butt|The Hon. Mr Justice Butt]] in the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division. Virginia Crawford was not in court and the sole evidence was her husband's account of Virginia's confession. There were also some accounts by servants, which were both circumstantial and insubstantial. Dilke, aware of his vulnerability over the affair with Virginia's mother, refused to give evidence, largely on the advice of his confidant [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. Butt found – paradoxically – that Virginia had been guilty of adultery with Dilke, but that there was no admissible evidence to show that Dilke had been guilty of adultery with Virginia. He concluded, \"I cannot see any case whatsoever against Sir Charles Dilke,\" dismissed Dilke from the suit with costs, and pronounced a [[decree nisi|decree ''nisi'']] dissolving the Crawfords' marriage.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nThe paradoxical finding left doubts hanging over Dilke's respectability, and [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] [[William Thomas Stead]] launched a public campaign against him. Two months later, in April, Dilke sought to re-open the case and clear his name by making the [[Queen's Proctor]] a party to the case and opposing the [[decree absolute]].<ref>''Crawford v. Crawford and Dilke (The Queen's Proctor intervening)'' (1886) 11 PD 150</ref> Unfortunately, Dilke and his legal team had badly miscalculated (his legal advice has been described as \"perhaps the worst professional advice ever given\"). Though they had planned to subject Virginia to a searching [[cross-examination]], Dilke, having been dismissed from the case, had no ''[[Standing (law)|locus standi]]''. As a consequence it was Dilke who was subjected to severe scrutiny in the witness box by [[Henry Matthews, 1st Viscount Llandaff|Henry Matthews]]. Matthews' attack was devastating and Dilke proved an unconvincing witness. His habit of physically cutting pieces out of his diary with scissors was held up to particular ridicule, as it created the impression that he had cut out evidence of potentially embarrassing appointments. The jury found that Virginia had presented the true version of the facts, and that the decree absolute should be granted.\n\nDilke was ruined. Other women claimed he had approached them for a liaison. Various lurid rumours circulated about his love-life, including that he had invited a maidservant to join himself and his lover in bed, and that he had introduced one or more of these to \"every kind of French vice\", and he became a figure of fun in bawdy music-hall songs.<ref>Nicholls 1995, p188, 191-2</ref> For a time it seemed that he would be tried for [[perjury]], although this did not eventuate.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The accusations had a devastating effect on his political career, leading eventually to the loss of his parliamentary seat ([[Chelsea (UK Parliament constituency)|Chelsea]]) in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886 UK general election]].<ref name=\"ODNB\">Jenkins (2004)</ref> [[Henry Matthews, 1st Viscount Llandaff|Matthews]], on the other hand, gained public acclaim, winning the seat of [[Birmingham East (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham East]] as a Conservative at the same election. Queen Victoria, who approved of his performance in the trial, demanded that he be included in Lord Salisbury's cabinet, and he was made Home Secretary. The Queen had asked in vain for Dilke to be stripped of his membership of the Privy Council.<ref>Nicholls 1995, p188, 191-2</ref>\n\nDilke spent much of the remainder of his life and much of his fortune trying to exonerate himself, and this adds weight to the view that Virginia lied about the identity of her lover. Over the years it has been suggested that political colleagues of Dilke's, including [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]] and Chamberlain himself,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> may have inspired Mrs Crawford to accuse him, seeing him as an obstacle to their own ambitions.\nDilke was largely exonerated by an inquiry in the early 1890s, which cast doubt on the truthfulness of Virginia's evidence - her description of their alleged love-nest in Warren Street was full of inaccuracies. It appears that she may well have been attempting to distract attention from an earlier affair with one Captain Forster.<ref>Nicholls 1995, p188, 191-2</ref>\n\n==Political career after 1886==\n\nDilke later became MP for [[Forest of Dean (UK Parliament constituency)|Forest of Dean]] in 1892, serving until his death in 1911 aged 67. He had hoped to be appointed Secretary of State for War in the Liberal Government formed in 1905, but this was not to be.\n\n==Cultural references==\nFollowing his death, fund raising commenced to establish a local community hospital in his Forest of Dean constituency. The Dilke Memorial Hospital, [[Cinderford]], opened its doors for the first time in 1923 and still exists as a permanent memorial to the popular M.P.\n\nIn the 1994 film [[Sirens (1994 film)|''Sirens'']], detailing sexual licence in Australia in the 1930s, the local pub is called the \"Sir Charles Dilke\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Dilke, Charles Wentworth.
