After studying at the universities of [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] and [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] and at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], he was admitted to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in Scotland, and called to the [[English bar]], though he never practised.\n\nIn 1780, he was returned to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for the [[Caithness (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness constituency]], and subsequently represented several [[England|English]] constituencies, his parliamentary career extending, with few interruptions, until 1811. Sinclair established at [[Edinburgh]] a society for the improvement of British [[wool]], and was mainly instrumental in the creation of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Board of Agriculture]], of which he was the first president.\n\nHis reputation as a financier and economist had been established by the publication, in 1784, of his '' History of the Public Revenue of the British Empire; '' in 1793 widespread ruin was prevented by the adoption of his plan for the issue of [[Exchequer Bills]]; and it was on his advice that, in 1797, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] issued the \"loyalty loan\" of eighteen millions for the prosecution of the war.<ref>{{cite web|title=SINCLAIR, Sir John, 1st Bt.

His eldest son, Sir George Sinclair, 2nd Baronet (1790–1868) was a writer and a [[Member of Parliament]], representing Caithness at intervals from 1811 until 1841. His son, [[Sir John Sinclair, 3rd Baronet|Sir John George Tollemache Sinclair, 3rd Baronet]], was member for the same constituency from 1869 to 1885. The first Baronet's third son, also John (1797–1875), became [[Archdeacon of Middlesex]]; the fourth son was [[s:A Naval Biographical Dictionary/Sinclair, Archibald|Captain Archibald Sinclair RN]]; the fifth son, [[William Sinclair (rector)|William]] (1804–1878), was [[Prebendary]] of [[Chichester]] and was the father of [[William Macdonald Sinclair]] (b. 1850), who in 1889 became [[Archdeacon of London]]; the fourth daughter, [[Catherine Sinclair]] was an author.\n\nIn the 1830s he is listed as living at 133 George Street, in the centre of [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's New Town]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/directories/browse/pageturner.cfm?id=83401671&mode=transcription|title=(209) - Scottish Post Office Directories > Towns > Edinburgh > 1805-1834 - Post Office annual directory > 1832-1833 - Scottish Directories - National Library of Scotland|work=nls.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Scientific agriculture==\nSinclair's services to scientific agriculture were conspicuous.<ref>R.Mitchison, 1962</ref> He supervised the compilation of the [[Statistical Accounts of Scotland|''Statistical Account of Scotland'']] (21 vols., 1791–1799) which was drawn up from the communications of the [[minister of religion|Ministers]] of the different [[parish]]es'. This became known as the \"Old Statistical Account.\" In volume XX (p. xiii) Sinclair explained the choice of name and the purpose of the inquiry:\n<blockquote>\n\"Many people were at first surprised at my using the words \"statistical\" and \"statistics\", as it was supposed that some term in our own language might have expressed the same meaning. But in the course of a very extensive tour through the northern parts of Europe, which I happened to take in 1786, I found that in Germany they were engaged in a species of political enquiry to which they had given the name \"statistics,\" and though I apply a different meaning to that word—for by \"statistical\" is meant in Germany an inquiry for the purposes of ascertaining the political strength of a country or questions respecting matters of state—whereas the idea I annex to the term is an inquiry into the state of a country, for the purpose of ascertaining the quantum of happiness enjoyed by its inhabitants, and the means of its future improvement; but as I thought that a new word might attract more public attention, I resolved on adopting it, and I hope it is now completely naturalised and incorporated with our language.\"\n</blockquote>\nFor Sinclair, statistics involved collecting facts, but these were not necessarily, or even typically, numerical.\n\nSinclair was a proponent of new agricultural methods, and large tracts of land on his [[Caithness]] estate were let out to tenants who kept new breeds of livestock such as [[Cheviot sheep]]. This plan meant evicting the sitting tenants and giving them smaller plots of land to work, often in harsh coastal areas such as [[Badbea]]. Eventually many of the displaced tenants emigrated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/item/item_maps.jsp?item_id=72810|title=Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster's 'Account of Improvements', map of Thurso|last=Anon|work=Am Baile: Highland history and culture|publisher=Am Baile/The Gaelic Village|accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref>\n\nSinclair was a member of most of the [[Continental Europe|continental]] agricultural societies, a fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]] and the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], as well as of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Antiquarian Society of London]], a member and sometimes president of the [[Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]], and sat as president of the [[Highland Society of London]] in 1796. Also, in 1796, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1797.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter S|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> \n\nOriginally a supporter of [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]]'s war policy, Sinclair later joined the party of \"armed neutrality.\" In 1805 he was appointed by Pitt a commissioner for the construction of roads and bridges in the north of Scotland, in 1810 he was made a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|privy council]] and, next year, received the lucrative sinecure office of [[Commissioner of excise]]. \n\nWhen the Statistical Society of London (now the [[Royal Statistical Society]]) was founded in 1834, Sinclair at 80 was the oldest original member. In the same year he presented a paper on agriculture to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], but this was found to lack \"facts which can be stated numerically.\"\n\n==Archaeological recording==\nSinclair's works sometimes were the first recording of details of [[archaeological]] monuments of [[Scotland]]. For example, the first recorded mention of the [[Catto Long Barrow]] in [[Aberdeenshire]] was made by Sinclair in 1795.<ref>C. Michael Hogan, 2008</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nHe was the author of the books ''Statistical Accounts of Scotland''; ''History of the Public Revenue of the British Empire'' 1784; ''The Code of Health and Longevity'' 1807; ''Code of Agriculture'' 1819.\nAfter a tour of agricultural inquiry in Flanders in 1815 he wrote a pamphlet: \"Hints Regarding the Agriculture State of the Netherlands, Compared with that of Great Britain\", Mc Millan, Londen, 1815\n\n==Line notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation |title=Sketch of the Civil and Traditional History of Caithness |last=Calder |first=John Traill |year=1887 |publisher=Rae |url=https://archive.org/stream/sketchcivilandt00sincgoog#page/n286/mode/2up}}\n* John Sinclair.
