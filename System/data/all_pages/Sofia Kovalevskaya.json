She was also one of the first women to work for a scientific journal as an editor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskay.|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/323006/Sofya-Vasilyevna-Kovalevskaya |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition.|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=22 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere are several alternative [[Romanization of Russian|transliterations]] of her name. She herself used  '''Sophie Kowalevski''' (or occasionally '''Kowalevsky'''), for her academic publications. After moving to Sweden, she called herself '''Sonya'''.\n\n==Early years==\nSofia Kovalevskaya (''[[née]]'' Korvin-Krukovskaya), was born in Moscow, the second of three children. Her father, Vasily Vasilyevich Korvin-Krukovsky, was a man of [[Poles|Polish]] descent and\nwas Lieutenant-General of Artillery who served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. Her mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna Schubert, was a scholarly woman of [[Germans|German]] ancestry and Sofia's grandmother was [[Romani people|Romani]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Women mathematicians|author=[[Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin]]|url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|publisher=JOC/EFR|accessdate=June 3, 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110607183749/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|archivedate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>  When she was 11 years old, the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes of differential and integral analysis, which was her early preparation  for calculus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best of Russia --- Famous Russians --- Scientists.|url=http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|work=TRISTARMEDIA {{!}} Web Design, Web Development, Multimedia, Creative Web Solutions|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThey nurtured her interest in mathematics and hired a tutor (A. N. Strannoliubskii, a well-known advocate of higher education for women), who taught her calculus. During that same period, the son of the local priest introduced her to [[nihilism]].<ref>Sofya Kovalevskaya, ''A Russian Childhood'', translated, edited, and introduced by Beatrice Stillman ; with an analysis of Kovalevskaya's Mathematics by P. Y. Kochina. Springer-Verlag, c1978 ISBN 0-387-90348-8</ref>\n\nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women there were not allowed to attend universities. In order to study abroad, she needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with [[Vladimir Kovalevskij]], then a young paleontology student who would later become famous for his collaboration with [[Charles Darwin]]. They emigrated from Russia in 1867.<ref name=RCooke>Roger Cooke, \"The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya\", Springer-Verlag, 1984.</ref>\n\n==Student years==\nIn 1869, Kovalevskaya began attending the [[University of Heidelberg]], Germany, which allowed her to audit classes as long as the professors involved gave their approval.\n\nShortly after beginning her studies there, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]], while she was invited to attend [[George Eliot]]'s Sunday salons.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> There, at age nineteen, she met  [[Herbert Spencer]] and was led into a debate, at Eliot's instigation,  on \"woman's capacity for abstract thought\". This was well before she made her notable contribution of the \"Kovalevskaya top\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section). George Eliot was writing ''[[Middlemarch]]'' at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke's mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\"<ref>George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), ''Middlemarch'', Chapter IV, last sentence.</ref> Kovalevskaya participated in social movements and shared ideas of utopian socialism. In 1871 she traveled to Paris together with her husband in order to attend to the injured from the [[Paris Commune]]. Kovalevskaya helped save [[Victor Jaclard]], who was the husband of her sister Ann ([[Anne Jaclard]]).\n\nAfter two years of mathematical studies at Heidelberg under such teachers as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]], she moved to Berlin, where she had to take private lessons from [[Karl Weierstrass]], as the university would not even allow her to audit classes. In 1874 she presented three papers—on [[partial differential equations]], on the dynamics of [[Saturn]]'s [[Rings of Saturn|rings]] and on [[elliptic integrals]]—to the [[University of Göttingen]] as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics ''summa cum laude'', bypassing the usual required lectures and examinations.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nShe thereby became the first woman in Europe to hold that degree.  Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the [[Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem]], which gives conditions for the existence of solutions to a certain class of those equations.\n\n==Last years in Germany and Sweden==\n[[File:Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya Bust.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust by Finnish sculptor [[Walter Runeberg]]]]\n\nIn the early 1880s, Sofia and her husband Vladimir developed financial problems. Sofia wanted to be a lecturer at the university; however, she was not allowed to because she was a woman, despite volunteering to provide free lectures.  Soon after,  Vladimir started a house building business with Sofia as  his assistant. In 1879, the price for mortgages became higher and they became bankrupt. Shortly after, Vladimir got a job offer and Sofia helped neighbours to electrify street lights. Vladimir and Sofia quickly established themselves again financially.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kochina|first=Pelageya|title=Love and Mathematics: Sofia Kovalevskaya|year=1985|publisher=Mir Publisher|location=Moscow}}</ref>\n\nThe Kovalevskiys returned to Russia, but failed to secure professorships because of their radical political beliefs. Discouraged, they went back to Germany. Vladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable, so they spent most of their time apart. Then, for some unknown reason, perhaps it was the death of her father, they decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. During this time their daughter, Sofia (called \"Fufa\"), was born. After a year devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of her older sister, resumed her work in mathematics and left Vladimir for what would be the last time. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nThat year, with the help of the mathematician [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]], whom she had known as a fellow student of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass']], Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a ''privat-docent'' at [[Stockholm University]] in Sweden.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler through his sister, actress, novelist, and playwright [[Anne Charlotte Leffler|Anne-Charlotte Edgren-Leffler]]. Until Kovalevskaya's death the two women shared a close friendship that was interpreted by some authors as a possibly romantic or even sexual relationship.<ref>McFadden, Margaret.

University Press of Kentucky, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe following year (1884) she was appointed to a five-year position as \"Professor Extraordinarius\" (Professor without Chair) and became the editor of [[Acta Mathematica]]. In 1888 she won the ''Prix Bordin'' of the French Academy of Science, for her work on the question: \"Mémoire sur un cas particulier du problème de le rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe, où l'intégration s'effectue à l'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps\".<ref name=RCooke/> Her submission included the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the \"[[Kovalevskaya Top]]\", which was subsequently shown (by [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]])  {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} to be the only other case of [[rigid body]] motion, beside the tops of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], that is \"completely [[integrable systems|integrable]]\".\n\nIn 1889 she was appointed Professor Ordinarius (Professorial Chair holder) at Stockholm University, the first woman to hold such a position at a northern European university.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the Academy's rules) she was granted a Chair in the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], but was never offered a professorship in Russia.\n\nKovalevskaya wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, ''A Russian Childhood'', plays (in collaboration with Duchess [[Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler]]) and a partly auto[[biographical novel]], ''Nihilist Girl'' (1890).\n\nShe died of [[1889–1890 flu pandemic|influenza]] in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a pleasure trip to Genoa.  She is buried in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], Sweden, at [[Norra begravningsplatsen]].\n\n==Tributes==\n[[File:RR5110-0034R.gif|thumb|left|140px|[[Commemorative coin]], 2000.]]\n[[File:Stamp of USSR 1635g.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Soviet Union]] [[postage stamp]], 1951.]]\n'''Sonya Kovalevsky High School Mathematics Day''' is a grant-making program of the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] (AWM), funding workshops across the United States which encourage girls to explore mathematics.\n\n'''The Sonya Kovalevsky Lecture''' is sponsored annually by the AWM, and is intended to highlight significant contributions of women in the fields of applied or computational mathematics.
