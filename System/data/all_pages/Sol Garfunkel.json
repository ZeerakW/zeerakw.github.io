Since 1980, Garfunkel has served as the executive director of the award winning [[non-profit organization]] the [[Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications]].<ref>[http://www.comap.com COMAP]</ref> Working with teachers, students, and business people to create learning environments where mathematics is used to investigate and model real issues in our world.\n\nSol is best known for hosting the 1987, [[PBS]] series titled \"For All Practical Purposes: An Introduction to Contemporary Mathematics\", followed by the 1991 series, \"Algebra: In Simplest Terms\", both often used in classrooms.\n\nAt the age of 24, Sol received his [[PhD]] in [[Mathematical Logic]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] . While in attendance he worked with [[Howard Jerome Keisler]], [[Michael D. Morley]], and [[Stephen Kleene]]. Dr. Garfunkel then served on faculty of Cornell University and the [[University of Connecticut]] at Storrs. \n\nDr. Garfunkel continues his work advocating for the improvement of Mathematics in public school systems.
