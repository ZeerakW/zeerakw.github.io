Friedman]] at the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Signal Intelligence Service]] (SIS) in the 1930s, along with [[Frank Rowlett]] and [[Abraham Sinkov]]. He went on to a long and distinguished career at SIS and its eventual successor, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). Kullback was the Chief Scientist at the NSA until his retirement in 1962, whereupon he took a position at the [[George Washington University]].\n\nThe [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] is named after Kullback and [[Richard Leibler]].\n\n==Life and career==\nKullback was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and attended [[Boy's High School]] there. He then went to [[City College of New York]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1927 and an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in math in 1929.<ref name = \"MMI\" /> He completed a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in math from [[George Washington University]] in 1934. His intention had been to teach, and he returned to Boy's High School to do so, but found it not to his taste; he discovered his real interest was using mathematics, not teaching it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nAt the suggestion of [[Abraham Sinkov]], who showed him a [[Civil Service]] flyer for \"junior mathematicians\" at US$2,000 per year, he took the examination. Both passed, and were assigned to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] as junior cryptanalysts.\n\nUpon arrival in Washington, Kullback was assigned to [[William F. Friedman]]. Friedman had begun an intensive program of training in cryptology for his new civilian employees. For several summers running, the SIS cryptanalysts attended training camps at [[Fort Meade]] until they received commissions as reserve officers in the Army. Kullback and Sinkov took Friedman's admonitions on education seriously and spent the next several years attending night classes; both received their doctorates in mathematics. Afterward, Kullback rediscovered a love of teaching; he began offering evening classes in mathematics at [[George Washington University]] from 1939 on.\n\nOnce they had completed the training, the three were put to the work for which they had actually been hired, compilations of [[cipher]] or [[code (cryptography)|code]] material for the [[U.S. Army]]. Another task was to test commercial cipher devices which vendors wished to sell to the U.S. government.\n\nKullback worked in partnership with [[Frank Rowlett]] against [[RED (cipher machine)|RED cipher machine]] messages. Almost overnight, they unravelled the keying system and then the machine pattern – with nothing but the intercepted messages in hand. Using the talents of linguist John Hurt to translate text, SIS started issuing current intelligence to military decision-makers.\n\nIn May 1942, five months after [[Pearl Harbor]], Kullback, by then a Major, was sent to [[UK|Britain]].<ref>[https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/oral_history_interviews/nsa_oh_17_82_kullback.pdf  Farley, R.D. & Schorreck H F Oral history interview NSA OH-17-82 with Solomon Kullback National Security Agency 26 August 1982 (declassified under FOIA Sept 12 2008)]</ref>  He learned at [[Bletchley Park]] that the British were producing intelligence of high quality by exploiting the [[Enigma machine]]. He also cooperated with the British in the solution of more conventional German codebook-based systems. Shortly after his return to the States, Kullback moved into the Japanese section as its chief.\n\nWhen the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) was formed in 1952, Rowlett became chief of cryptanalysis. The primary problem facing research and development in the post-war period was development of high-speed processing equipment. Kullback supervised a staff of about 60, including such innovative thinkers in automated data processing development as [[Leo Rosen]] and Sam Snyder. His staff pioneered new forms of input and memory, such as [[magnetic tape]] and [[drum memory]], and compilers to make machines truly \"multi-purpose.\" Kullback gave priority to using computers to generate [[communications security]] (COMSEC) materials.\n\n==Retirement==\nSolomon Kullback retired from NSA in 1962, and focused on his teaching at George Washington University and publishing new papers. A [[colonel]], he is a member of the [[Military Intelligence Hall of Fame]].\n\nKullback is remembered by his colleagues at NSA as straightforward; one described him as \"totally guileless, you always knew where you stood with him.\" One former NSA senior recalled him as a man of unlimited energy and enthusiasm and a man whose judgment was usually \"sound and right.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name = \"MMI\">{{cite book\n|first1=Kenneth P.\n|last1=Burnham\n|first2=David R.\n|last2=Anderson\n|title=Model Selection and Multimodel Inference\n|edition=2nd\n|origyear=1998\n|year=2002\n|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media\n|location=New York City\n|isbn=978-0-387-95364-9\n|oclc=\n|page=141\n|lccn=2001057677\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathGenealogy|id=13292}}\n* [http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/hall_of_honor/1999/kullback.shtml Solomon Kullback at the NSA Hall of Fame]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Kullback, Solomon\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = \n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American cryptographer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 1907-04-03\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Brooklyn, New York]]\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 1994-08-05\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = [[Boynton Beach, Florida]]\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kullback, Solomon}}\n[[Category:1903 births]]\n[[Category:1994 deaths]]\n[[Category:American cryptographers]]\n[[Category:National Security Agency cryptographers]]\n[[Category:Signals Intelligence Service cryptographers]]\n[[Category:City College of New York alumni]]\n[[Category:George Washington University alumni]]\n[[Category:George Washington University faculty]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:Winners of the Wilks Memorial Award]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Solomon Kullback"}}}}
