He studied mathematics in [[Toruń University]] and [[Wrocław University]]. He defended his master thesis on some problems of the game theory prepared under supervision of [[Hugo Steinhaus]] at [[Wrocław University]] in 1955. In 1955 he became a faculty member at Department of Mathematics, [[Wrocław University of Technology]]. In 1959 he was distinguished as the candidate of science and in 1960 he defended his PhD on minimax estimation under supervision of [[Hugo Steinhaus]]. Many years Trybuła cooperated or was the staff member of [[Institute of Power Systems]] (IASE) in [[Wrocław]]. He worked out the original method of identification of the complex power systems. Since 1968 he was faculty member of the [[Wydział Podstawowych Problemów Techniki Politechniki Wrocławskiej|Institute of Mathematics]], [[Wrocław University of Technology]]. '''Stanisław Trybuła''' got habilitation at [[Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry]], [[Wrocław University]] in 1968 based on his seminal works on [[sequential analysis]] for [[stochastic process]]es. He took early retirement in 1998 and was writing academic books on statistics and the game theory.\n\nStanisław Trybuła is the co-author of  the WJ [[bidding system]] in the [[contract bridge|bridge]], known also as [[Polish Club]] (see also [[Trybula transfers]], [[Wesolowski texas]], [[Gawrys fourth suit forcing]]).\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite encyclopedia\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Trybuła transfers\n  | encyclopedia = Encyklopedia Brydża\n  | editor = Bogumił Seifert and Selim Achmatowicz \n  | volume = \n  | pages = 796\n  | publisher = [[Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe|PWN]] \n  | location = Waszawa\n  | year = 1996\n  | url = http://ksiazki.wp.pl/katalog/ksiazki/ksiazka.html?kw=10459\n  | accessdate = }}\n\n* {{cite book\n  |last= Jassem\n  |first=Krzysztof \n  |authorlink= \n  |coauthors= \n  |others= Translated into English by Daniel J.
