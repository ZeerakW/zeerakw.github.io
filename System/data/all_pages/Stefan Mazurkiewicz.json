He was a student of [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] (''PAU''). His students included [[Karol Borsuk]], [[Bronisław Knaster]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], [[Stanisław Saks]], and [[Antoni Zygmund]].  For a time Mazurkiewicz was a professor at the [[University of Paris]]; however, he spent most of his career as a professor at the [[University of Warsaw]].  \n\n{{Cipher Bureau}}\nThe [[space-filling curve#The Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem|Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem]], a basic result on [[curve]]s prompted by the phenomenon of [[space-filling curve]]s, is named for Mazurkiewicz and [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]]. His 1935 paper ''Sur l'existence des continus indécomposables'' is generally considered the most elegant piece of work in [[point-set topology]].\n\nDuring the [[Polish-Soviet War]] (1919-1921), Mazurkiewicz as early as 1919 broke the most common [[Russia]]n [[cipher]] for the Polish [[General Staff]]'s [[Biuro Szyfrów|cryptological agency]].  Thanks to this, orders issued by Soviet commander [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]'s staff were known to Polish Army leaders.  This contributed substantially, perhaps decisively, to Polish victory at the critical [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] and possibly to Poland's survival as an independent country. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Biuro Szyfrów]]       \n\n==External links==\n* {{MathGenealogy |id=12547}}\n* {{MacTutor Biography|id=Mazurkiewicz}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Mazurkiewicz, Stefan\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Polish cryptographer\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 25 September 1888\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 19 June 1945\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mazurkiewicz, Stefan}}\n[[Category:1888 births]]\n[[Category:1945 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Warsaw]]\n[[Category:20th-century Polish mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Polish cryptographers]]\n[[Category:Topologists]]\n[[Category:University of Paris faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Warsaw faculty]]\n[[Category:Mathematical analysts]]\n[[Category:Biuro Szyfrów]]\n[[Category:University of Warsaw alumni]]\n\n{{Poland-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Stefan Mazurkiewicz"}}}}
