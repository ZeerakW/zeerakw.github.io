Ralescu''' (born March 27, 1952 in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]) is a leading statistician who has made significant contributions{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} to the theory of [[statistical inference]], mainly through [[asymptotic theory]]. He is a professor of mathematics and statistics at [[Queens College]] of the [[City University of New York]] in [[New York]]. He studied first at the [[University of Bucharest]] obtaining an MA in mathematics (1976). He came to [[Indiana University]] in 1977, completing his PhD in 1981 under the direction of {{link-interwiki|lang=it|en=Madan Lal Puri}}. Before moving to New York, Ralescu was an Assistant Professor in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University (1981–1984).\n\nHis research themes are varied, with noteworthy contributions{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} in the fields of asymptotic theory of perturbed empirical and quantile processes, nonparametric [[density estimation]] and Stein estimation (see [[James–Stein estimator]]). Other applied work that received praise was written up in collaboration with Dr. A. Cassvan in connection to techniques using brain auditory [[evoked potentials]] (BAEP). The paper \"Brainstem auditory evoked potential studies in patients with tinnitus and/or vertigo\" is a standard reference.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\nHe has published more than 70 research articles in prestigious scientific international periodicals. He is an Associate Editor of Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference (JSPI) and International Journal of Statistics and Systems (IJSS). He was a former director of the mathematics section of the PSC-CUNY Research Foundation.\n\nRalescu is an Elected Fellow of the [[International Statistical Institute]]. He is listed in ''[[Marquis Who's Who]]'' in Science and Engineering (since 1995).\n\nHis hobbies include rare [[book collecting]] and bridge. A bridge champion in his native Romania in the early 1970s, Ştefan Ralescu has published many bridge articles that have appeared in ''[[The Bridge World]]'', the ''ACBL Bulletin'' and ''Bridge Today'', among other magazines.\n\n== Selected publications ==\n* D.
