Brams''' (born November 28, 1940, in [[Concord, New Hampshire]]) is a [[game theory|game theorist]] and [[political scientist]] at the [[New York University]] Department of Politics. Brams is best known for using the techniques of [[game theory]], [[public choice theory]], and [[social choice theory]] to analyze [[voting systems]] and [[fair division]]. He is one of the independent discoverers of [[approval voting]],<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter\n |title=Approval Voting\n |year=1978\n |jstor=1955105 |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=831–847\n |doi=10.2307/1955105}}\n</ref> as well as an extension of approval voting to multiple-winner elections known as [[Satisfaction approval voting]].<ref>Steven J.
