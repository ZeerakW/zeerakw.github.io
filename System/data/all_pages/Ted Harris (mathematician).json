The [[Harris inequality]] in [[statistical physics]] and [[percolation theory]] is named after him.\n\nHe received his Ph.D. at [[Princeton University]] in 1947 under advisor [[Samuel S. Wilks|Samuel Wilks]].  From 1947 until 1966 he worked for the [[RAND Corporation]], heading their mathematics department from 1959 to 1965. From 1966 until retirement in 1989 he was Professor of Mathematics and Electrical Engineering at [[University of Southern California]].\n\nHe was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://web.archive.org/web/20061204201404/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/college_magazine/spring_2006/obituaries.html | title = College Magazine Obituaries: Theodore E.
