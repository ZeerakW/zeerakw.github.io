His nomination reads: {{centered pull quote|Speed is regarded internationally as THE expert on the analysis of microarray data. This results partly from the sheer ingenuity of his work, and in part it is due to his commitment to working closely with biomedical scientists, enabling him to appreciate first-hand the biological challenges and the consequent requirements of new methodology. Microarrays are now being replaced by short-read [[DNA sequencing]], but Speed continues to contribute new ideas for the new technology. At other time in his career, Speed has made seminal contributions to [[bioinformatics]], [[statistical genetics]], the analysis of designed experiments, graphical models and [[Bayesian network|Bayes networks]].<ref name=royal>{{cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/people/fellowship/2013/terence-speed |title = Professor Terry Speed FRS|publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=2015-02-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203211701/https://royalsociety.org/people/fellowship/2013/terence-speed/ |location=London}}</ref>}}\n\n==Personal life==\nSpeed married Freda Elizabeth Pollard in 1964.<ref name=whoswho/>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME = Speed, Terry\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES = Speed, Terence Paul\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Australian academic\n| DATE OF BIRTH = 14 March 1943\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Speed, Terry}}\n[[Category:1943 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science]]\n[[Category:ISI highly cited researchers]]\n[[Category:Australian statisticians]]\n[[Category:Bioinformaticians]]\n[[Category:American social scientists]] <!-- e.g. providing expert witness testimony on criminology and auditing science -->\n[[Category:Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research alumni]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Terry Speed"}}}}
