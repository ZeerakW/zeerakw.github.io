Cambridge.</ref>), a Greek native of [[Eresos]] in [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], was the successor to [[Aristotle]] in the [[Peripatetic school]]. He came to [[Athens]] at a young age and initially studied in [[Platonic Academy|Plato's school]]. After Plato's death, he attached himself to Aristotle. Aristotle bequeathed to Theophrastus his writings and designated him as his successor at the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Theophrastus presided over the Peripatetic school for thirty-six years, during which time the school flourished greatly.  He is often considered the \"father of [[botany]]\" for his works on plants.  After his death, the Athenians honoured him with a public funeral. His successor as head of the school was [[Strato of Lampsacus]].\n\nThe interests of Theophrastus were wide ranging, extending from [[biology]] and [[physics]] to [[ethics]] and [[metaphysics]]. His two surviving [[botanical]] works, ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum)]]''  and ''On the Causes of Plants'', were an important influence on [[Renaissance]] [[science]]. There are also surviving works ''On Moral Characters'', ''On Sensation'', ''On Stones'', and fragments on ''Physics'' and ''Metaphysics''. In philosophy, he studied [[grammar]] and [[language]] and continued Aristotle's work on [[logic]]. He also regarded [[space]] as the mere arrangement and position of bodies, [[time]] as an accident of motion, and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] as a necessary consequence of all activity. In [[ethics]], he regarded [[happiness]] as depending on external influences as well as on [[virtue]] and famously said that \"life is ruled by fortune, not wisdom.\"\n\n==Life==\nMost of the biographical information we have of Theophrastus was provided by  Diogenes Laërtius' ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', written more than four hundred years after Theophrastus' time.<ref name=Hort1916>{{cite book|title=Theophrastus: Enquiry into Plants|titlelink=Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|volume=1, Book I–V|author=Theophrastus|editor=Hort A.

Like Aristotle, most of his writings are [[lost work]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Thus Theophrastus, like Aristotle, had composed a first and second ''Analytic'' (Ἀναλυτικῶν προτέρων and Ἀναλυτικῶν ὑστέρων).<ref name=\"diog42\">Diogenes Laërtius, v. 42</ref> He had also written books on ''Topics'' (Ἀνηγμένων τόπων, Τοπικῶν and Τὰ πρὸ τῶν τόπων);<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, v. 42, 45, 50</ref> on the ''Analysis of Syllogisms'' (Περὶ ἀναλύσεως συλλογισμῶν and Περὶ συλλογισμῶν λύσεως), on ''Sophisms'' (Σοφισμάτων) and ''On Affirmation and Denial'' (Περὶ καταφάσεως καὶ ἀποφάσεως)<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, v. 42, 45</ref> as well as on the ''Natural Philosophy'' (Περὶ φύσεως, Περὶ φυσικῶν, Φυσικῶν and others), on ''Heaven'' (Περὶ οὐρανοῦ), and on ''Meteorological Phenomena'' (Τῆς μεταρσιολεσχίας and Μεταρσιολογικῶν).<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, v. 46, 50, 43, 44</ref> \n\n[[Image:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to the illustrated 1644 edition of the ''Enquiry into Plants'' (''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]'')]]\n\nIn addition, Theophrastus wrote on the ''Warm and the Cold'' (Περὶ θερμοῦ καὶ ψυχροῦ),<ref name=\"diog44\">Diogenes Laërtius, v. 44</ref> on ''Water'' (Περὶ ὕδατος), ''Fire'' (Περὶ πυρὸς),<ref name=\"diog45\">Diogenes Laërtius, v. 45</ref> ''the Sea'' (Περὶ θαλάττης),<ref name=\"diog45\"/> on ''Coagulation and Melting'' (Περὶ πήξεων καὶ τήξεων), on various phenomena of organic and spiritual life,<ref name=\"diog45\"/> and on the ''Soul'' (Περὶ ψυχῆς), ''On Experience'' (Περὶ ἐμπειρίας) and ''On Sense Perception'' (also known as ''On the Senses''; Περὶ αἰσθήσεων).<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, v. 42, 46</ref> Likewise, we find mention of monographs of Theophrastus on the early Greek philosophers [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], [[Anaxagoras]], [[Empedocles]], [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]],<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, v. 42, 43</ref> [[Diogenes of Apollonia]], [[Democritus]],<ref name=\"diog43\">Diogenes Laërtius, v. 43</ref> which were made use of by [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]]; and also on [[Xenocrates]],<ref name=\"diog47\">Diogenes Laërtius, v. 47</ref> against the [[Platonism|Academics]],<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, v. 49</ref> and a sketch of the political doctrine of [[Plato]].<ref name=\"diog43\"/>\n\nHe studied general history, as we know from [[Plutarch]]'s lives of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], [[Solon]], [[Aristides]], [[Pericles]], [[Nicias]], [[Alcibiades]], [[Lysander]], [[Agesilaus]], and [[Demosthenes]], which were probably borrowed from the work on ''Lives'' (Περὶ βίων).<ref name=\"diog42\"/> But his main efforts were to continue the labours of Aristotle in [[natural history]]. This is testified to not only by a number of treatises on individual subjects of [[zoology]], of which, besides the titles, only fragments remain, but also by his books on ''Stones'', his ''Enquiry into Plants'', and ''On the Causes of Plants'' (see below), which have come down to us entire. In politics, also, he seems to have trodden in the footsteps of Aristotle. Besides his books on the ''State'' (Πολιτικῶν and Πολιτικοῦ), we find quoted various treatises on ''Education'' (Περὶ παιδείας βασιλέως and Περὶ παιδείας),<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, v. 42, 50</ref> on ''Royalty'' (Περὶ βασιλείας, Περὶ παιδείας βασιλέως and Πρὸς Κάσανδρον περὶ βασιλείας),<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, v. 42, 47, 45</ref> on the ''Best State'' (Περὶ τῆς ἀρίστης πολιτείας), on ''Political Morals'' (Πολιτικῶν ἐθῶν), and particularly his works on the ''Laws'' (Νόμων κατὰ στοιχεῖον, Νόμων ἐπιτομῆς and Περὶ νόμων), one of which, containing a recapitulation of the laws of various [[barbarian]] as well as [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] states, was intended to be a companion to Aristotle's outline of ''Politics'', and must have been similar to it.<ref>Cicero, ''de Finibus'', v. 4.</ref> He also wrote on [[Public speaking|oratory]] and [[poetry]].<ref>Cicero, ''de Invent.'' i. 35.</ref> Theophrastus, without doubt, departed further from Aristotle in his [[ethical]] writings,<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, v. 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50</ref> as also in his [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] investigations of [[Motion (physics)|motion]], the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and [[God]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, v. 48</ref>\n\nBesides these writings, Theophrastus wrote several collections of problems, out of which some things at least have passed into the ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]]'' that have come down to us under the name of Aristotle,<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, v. 45, 47, 48; comp.

Hort remarks.<ref name=Hort1916/> \"There is no literary charm; the sentences are mostly compressed and highly elliptical, to the point sometimes of obscurity\".<ref name=Hort1916/> The text of these fragments and extracts is often so corrupt that there is a certain plausibility to the well-known story that the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus were allowed to languish in the cellar of [[Neleus of Scepsis]] and his descendents.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\">{{SmithDGRBM|wstitle=Theophrastus|volume=3}}</ref>\n\n===On Plants===\n[[Image:Oman Dhofar Frankincense.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frankincense]] trees in [[Dhufar]]]]\n{{main|Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)}}\n\nThe most important of his books are two large botanical treatises, ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]'' (Περὶ φυτῶν ἱστορία), and ''On the Causes of Plants'' (Περὶ φυτῶν αἰτιῶν), which constitute the most important contribution to botanical science during antiquity and the Middle Ages,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} the first systemization of the botanical world; on the strength of these works some, following [[Linnaeus]], call him the \"father of [[botany]].\"<ref name=\"philobio11\"/>\n\nThe ''Enquiry into Plants'' was originally ten books, of which nine survive. The work is arranged into a system whereby plants are classified according to their modes of generation, their localities, their sizes, and according to their practical uses such as foods, juices, herbs, etc.<ref name=\"Long1842\">\"Theophrastus\" entry in the ''[[Penny Cyclopaedia]] of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'', edited by George Long, (1842), Volume 24, pp. 332–4</ref> The first book deals with the parts of plants; the second book with the reproduction of plants and the times and manner of sowing; the third, fourth, and fifth books are devoted to trees, their types, their locations, and their practical applications; the sixth book deals with [[shrubs]] and spiny plants; the seventh book deals with herbs; the eighth book deals with plants that produce edible seeds; and the ninth book deals with plants that produce useful juices, [[natural gum|gums]], [[resins]], etc.<ref name=\"Long1842\"/>\n[[Image:Cinnamomum verum - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-182.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Cinnamomum verum]]'', from ''[[Köhler's Medicinal Plants]]'', (1887)]]\n\n''On the Causes of Plants'' was originally eight books, of which six survive. It concerns the growth of plants; the influences on their fecundity; the proper times they should be sown and reaped; the methods of preparing the soil, manuring it, and the use of tools; and of the smells, tastes, and properties of many types of plants.<ref name=\"Long1842\"/> The work deals mainly with the economical uses of plants rather than their medicinal uses, although the latter is sometimes mentioned.<ref name=\"Long1842\"/>\n\nAlthough these works contain many absurd and fabulous statements, they include valuable observations concerning the functions and properties of plants.<ref name=\"Long1842\"/> Theophrastus detected the process of [[germination]] and realized the importance of climate and soil to plants. Much of the information on the Greek plants may have come from his own observations, as he is known to have travelled throughout Greece, and to have had a botanical garden of his own; but the works also profit from the reports on plants of Asia brought back from those who followed [[Alexander the Great]]: {{quote|to the reports of Alexander's followers he owed his accounts of such plants as the [[Cotton|cotton-plant]], [[banyan]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[cinnamon]], [[myrrh]], and [[frankincense]].<ref name=Hort1916/>}}\n\nTheophrastus' ''Enquiry into Plants'' was first published in a [[Latin]] translation by [[Theodore Gaza]], at Treviso, 1483;<ref>Theodore Gaza, a refugee from [[Thessalonika]], was working from a lost Greek manuscript that was different from any others (Hort).</ref> in its original Greek it first appeared from the press of [[Aldus Manutius]] at Venice, 1495–98, from a third-rate manuscript, which, like the majority of the manuscripts that were sent to printers' workshops in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, has disappeared.<ref>It was carefully copied in a printing at [[Basel]], 1541.</ref> [[Christian Friedrich Heinrich Wimmer|Wimmer]] identified two manuscripts of first quality, the ''Codex Urbinas'' in the [[Vatican Library]], which was not made known to [[Johann Gottlob Schneider|J. G. Schneider]], who made the first modern critical edition, 1818–21, and the excerpts in the ''Codex Parisiensis'' in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].\n\n{{botanist|Theophr.}}\n\n===Characters===\nHis book {{anchor|Characters}}''Characters'' (Ἠθικοὶ χαρακτῆρες), if it is indeed his, deserves a separate mention. The work contains thirty brief, vigorous, and trenchant outlines of moral types, which form a most valuable picture of the life of his time, and in fact of human nature in general.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} They are the first recorded attempt at systematic [[character sketch|character writing]]. The book has been regarded by some as an independent work; others incline to the view that the sketches were written from time to time by Theophrastus, and collected and edited after his death; others, again, regard the ''Characters'' as part of a larger systematic work, but the style of the book is against this.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Theophrastus has found many imitators in this kind of writing, notably [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] (1608), [[Thomas Overbury|Sir Thomas Overbury]] (1614–16), [[John Earle (bishop)|Bishop Earle]] (1628), and [[Jean de La Bruyère]] (1688), who also translated the ''Characters''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[George Eliot]] also took inspiration from Theophrastus' ''Characters'', most notably in her book of caricatures, ''[[Impressions of Theophrastus Such]]''. Writing the \"[[character sketch]]\" as a scholastic exercise also originated in Theophrastus's typology.\n\n===On Sensation===\nA treatise ''On Sense Perception'' (Περὶ αἰσθήσεων) and its objects is important for a knowledge of the doctrines of the more ancient Greek philosophers regarding the subject. A paraphrase and commentary on this work was written by [[Priscian of Lydia]] in the sixth century.<ref name=\"Long1842\"/> With this type of work we may connect the fragments on ''Smells'', on ''Fatigue'', on ''Dizziness'', on ''Sweat'', on ''Swooning'', on ''Palsy'', and on ''Honey''.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\"/>\n\n===Physics===\nWe also possess in fragments a ''History of Physics'' (Περὶ φυσικῶν ἱστοριῶν). To this class of work belong the still extant sections on ''Fire'', on the ''Winds'', and on the signs of ''Waters'', ''Winds'', and ''Storms''.<ref>Probably out of the fourth book of the ''Meteorology'' (\"ἐν τετάρτῃ περὶ μεταρσίων\") of Theophrastus: see Plutarch, ''Quaest.

He also deals with precious stones, [[emeralds]], [[amethysts]], [[onyx]], [[jasper]], etc., and describes a variety of \"sapphire\" that was blue with veins of gold, and thus was presumably [[lapis-lazuli]].<ref name=\"Cuvier1830\"/>\n\nHe knew that [[pearls]] came from [[shell-fish]], that [[coral]] came from India, and speaks of the [[fossilized]] remains of organic life.<ref name=\"Cuvier1830\"/> Theophrastus made the first known reference to the phenomenon of [[pyroelectricity]], noting that the mineral [[tourmaline]] becomes charged when heated. He also considers the practical uses of various stones, such as the minerals necessary for the manufacture of glass; for the production of various pigments of paint such as [[ochre]]; and for the manufacture of [[plaster]].<ref name=\"Cuvier1830\"/> He discusses the use of the [[touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]] for [[assaying]] gold and gold alloys, an important property which would require the genius of [[Archimedes]] to resolve in quantitative detail when he was asked to investigate the suspected debasement of a crown a few years later.\n\nMany of the rarer minerals were found in mines, and he mentions the famous [[copper]] mines of [[Cyprus]] and the even more famous [[silver mine]]s, presumably of [[Laurium]] near [[Athens]], and upon which the wealth of the city was based, as well as referring to [[gold mines]]. The Laurium silver mines, which were the property of the state, were usually leased for a fixed sum and a percentage on the working. Towards the end of the fifth century the output fell, partly owing to the [[Sparta]]n occupation of [[Decelea]]. But the mines continued to be worked, though [[Strabo]] records that in his time the tailings were being worked over, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] speaks of the mines as a thing of the past. The ancient workings, consisting of shafts and galleries for excavating the ore, and washing tables for extracting the metal, may still be seen. Theophrastus wrote a separate work ''On Mining'',<ref name=\"diog44\"/> which like most of his writings is a [[lost work]].\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] makes clear references to his use of ''On Stones'' in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of 77 AD, while updating and making much new information available on [[minerals]] himself. Although Pliny's treatment of the subject is more extensive, Theophrastus is more systematic and his work is comparatively free from fable and magic,<ref>John F.

Oxford University Press</ref> although he did describe [[lyngurium]], a gemstone supposedly formed of the solidified urine of the [[lynx]] (the best ones coming from wild males), which was included in many lapidiaries until it gradually disappeared from view in the 17th century.<ref>Walton, abstract & throughout</ref>  From both of these early texts was to emerge the science of [[mineralogy]], and ultimately [[geology]]. Pliny is especially observant on [[crystal habit]] and mineral hardness, for example.\n\n==Philosophy==\n[[Image:Theophrastus Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|upright|thumb|Theophrastus, depicted as a medieval scholar in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]\nThe extent to which Theophrastus followed Aristotle's doctrines, or defined them more accurately, or conceived them in a different form, and what additional structures of thought he placed upon them, can only be partially determined because of the loss of so many of his writings.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\"/> Many of his opinions have to be reconstructed from the works of later writers such as [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]].\n\n===Logic===\nTheophrastus seems to have carried out still further the [[grammatical]] foundation of [[logic]] and [[rhetoric]], since in his book on the elements of [[speech]], he distinguished the main parts of speech from the subordinate parts, and also direct expressions (κυρία λέξις ''kuria lexis'') from metaphorical expressions, and dealt with the emotions (πάθη ''pathe'') of speech.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.'' 8</ref> He further distinguished a twofold reference of speech (σχίσις ''schisis'') to things (πράγματα ''pragmata'') and to the hearers, and referred poetry and rhetoric to the latter.<ref>Ammonius, ''de Interpr.'' 53; Schol. ''in Arist.'' p. 108, 27</ref>\n\nHe wrote at length on the unity of [[judgment]],<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' f. 128, 124; Schol. ''in Arist.'' p. 184. 24. 183, b. 2; Boethius, ''de Interpr.''</ref> on the different kinds of negation,<ref>Ammonius, ''in Arist. de Interpr.'' 128; Schol. ''in Arist.'' p. 121. 18</ref> and on the difference between unconditional and conditional necessity.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' f. 12. 6; Schol. ''in Arist.'' p. 149. 44</ref> In his doctrine of [[syllogisms]] he brought forward the proof for the conversion of universal affirmative judgments, differed from Aristotle here and there in the laying down and arranging the ''modi'' of the syllogisms,<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 14, 72, 73, 82. 22, b, 35; Boethius, ''de Syll. categ.'' ii. 594. 5, f. 603, 615</ref> partly in the proof of them,<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 39, b</ref> partly in the doctrine of mixture, i.e. of the influence of the modality of the premises upon the modality of the conclusion.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 39, b. etc. 40, 42, 56, b. 82, 64, b. 51; John Phil. xxxii, b. etc.</ref> Then, in two separate works, he dealt with the reduction of arguments to the syllogistic form and on the resolution of them;<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 115</ref> and further, with hypothetical conclusions.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Arist. Anal. Pr.'' 109, b. etc. 131, b.; John Phil. lx. etc. lxxv.; Boethius, ''de Syll. hypoth.''</ref> For the doctrine of [[Proof (truth)|proof]], [[Galen]] quotes the second ''Analytic'' of Theophrastus, in conjunction with that of Aristotle, as the best treatises on that doctrine.<ref>Galen, ''de Hippocr. et Plat. Dogm.'' ii. 2.</ref> In different [[monograph]]s he seems to have tried to expand it into a general theory of [[science]]. To this, too, may have belonged the proposition quoted from his ''Topics'', that the ''principles of opposites'' are themselves opposed, and cannot be deduced from one and the same higher genus.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.'' f. 5; Schol. p. 89. 15; comp. Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Metaph.'' p. 342. 30</ref> For the rest, some minor deviations from the Aristotelian definitions are quoted from the ''Topica'' of Theophrastus.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Top.'' 5, 68, 72, 25, 31.</ref> Closely connected with this treatise was that upon ambiguous words or ideas,<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Top.'' 83, 189</ref> which, without doubt, corresponded to book Ε of Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\"/>\n\n===Physics and metaphysics===\nTheophrastus introduced his Physics with the proof that all natural existence, being corporeal and composite, requires ''principles'',<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' f. 1, 6</ref> and first and foremost, [[Motion (physics)|motion]], as the basis of all change.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' f. 5, 6</ref> Denying the substance of [[space]], he seems to have regarded it, in opposition to Aristotle, as the mere arrangement and position (''taxis'' and ''thesis'') of bodies.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' 149, b. 141</ref> [[Time]] he called an accident of motion, without, it seems, viewing it, with Aristotle, as the numerical determinant of motion.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' f. 87, b; John Phil. 213. 4.</ref> He attacked the doctrine of the four [[classical elements]] and challenged whether [[fire (classical element)|fire]] could be called a primary element when it appears to be compound, requiring, as it does, another material for its own nutriment.<ref>Theophrastus, ''On Fire'', 1</ref>\n\n[[Image:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aristotle]]]]\nHe departed more widely from Aristotle in his doctrine of motion, since on the one hand he extended it over all categories, and did not limit it to those laid down by Aristotle.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.''; comp. Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' 94, 201, 202, 1.</ref> He viewed motion, with Aristotle, as an activity, not carrying its own goal in itself (''ateles''), of that which only [[Potentiality and actuality|potentially]] exists,<ref>Simplicius, l. c. and f. 94, 1.</ref> but he opposed Aristotle's view that motion required a special explanation, and he regarded it as something proper both to nature in general and the celestial system in particular:\n\n{{Cquote|''Surely, then, if the life in animals does not need explanation or is to be explained only in this way, may it not be the case that in the heavens too, and in the heavenly bodies, movement does not need explanation or is to be explained in a special way?''<ref>{{cite book|title=The philosophy of Chrysippus ''(1970)''|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_iV8W75G-JsC&pg=PA24&dq=Surely,+then,+if+the+life+in+animals+does+not+need+explanation+or+is+to+be+explained+only+in+this+way,+may+it+not+be+the+case+that+in+the+heavens+too,+and+in+the+heavenly+bodies,+movement+does+not+need+explanation+or+is+to+be+explained+in+a+special+way?&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MV2pUeLrNsm9iwK-woHYCg&ved=0CDgQuwUwAg#v=onepage&q=Surely%2C%20then%2C%20if%20the%20life%20in%20animals%20does%20not%20need%20explanation%20or%20is%20to%20be%20explained%20only%20in%20this%20way%2C%20may%20it%20not%20be%20the%20case%20that%20in%20the%20heavens%20too%2C%20and%20in%20the%20heavenly%20bodies%2C%20movement%20does%20not%20need%20explanation%20or%20is%20to%20be%20explained%20in%20a%20special%20way%3F&f=false|publisher=''The philosophy of Chrysippus'' by Josiah Gould, p. 24 ([[Google Books]])|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}</ref>}} — Theophrastus, ''Metaphysics'', 10a.16-29\n\nHe recognised no activity without motion,<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.''</ref> and so referred all activities of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to motion: the desires and emotions to corporeal motion, judgment (''kriseis'') and contemplation to spiritual motion.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' 225</ref> The idea of a spirit entirely independent of organic activity, must therefore have appeared to him very doubtful; yet he appears to have contented himself with developing his doubts and difficulties on the point, without positively rejecting it.<ref>Themistius, ''in Arist. de An.'' 89, b. 91, b.</ref> Other Peripatetics, like [[Dicaearchus]], [[Aristoxenus]], and especially [[Strato of Lampsacus|Strato]], developed further this [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] in Aristotelian doctrine.\n\nTheophrastus seems, generally speaking, where the investigation overstepped the limits of experience, to have preferred to develop the difficulties rather than solve them, as is especially apparent in his ''Metaphysics''.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\"/> He was doubtful of Aristotle's [[teleology]] and recommended that such ideas be used with caution:\n\n{{Cquote|''With regard to the view that all things are for the sake of an end and nothing is in vain, the assignation of ends is in general not easy, as it is usually stated to be ... we must set certain limits to purposiveness and to the effort after the best, and not assert it to exist in all cases without qualification''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Chrysippus - Two Traditional Characterizations ''(1970)''|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=re43AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq= |quote=With regard to the view that all things are for the sake of an end and nothing is in vain, the assignation of ends is in general not easy, as it is usually stated to be ... we must set certain limits to purposiveness and to the effort after the best, and not assert it to exist in all cases without qualification. |publisher=''The Philosophy of Chrysippus'' by Josiah Gould, p. 25 ([[Google Books]]) |deadurl=no |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref>}} - Theophrastus, ''Metaphysics'', 10a.22–24, 11a.1–3\n\nHe did not follow the incessant attempts by Aristotle to refer phenomena to their ultimate foundations, or his attempts to unfold the internal connections between the latter, and between them and phenomena.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\"/> In antiquity, it was a subject of complaint that Theophrastus had not expressed himself with precision and consistency respecting [[God]], and had understood it at one time as [[Heaven]], at another an (enlivening) breath (''[[pneuma]]'').<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Protrept.''; Cicero, ''de Natura Deorum'', i. 13</ref>\n\n===Ethics===\n[[File:Theophrastus.jpg|thumb|upright|The bust inscribed \"Θεόφραστος Μελάντα Ἐρέσιος (''Theophrastos Melanta Eresios'')\"]]\nTheophrastus did not allow a happiness resting merely upon virtue,<ref>Cicero, ''Academica'', i. 10, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', v. 9</ref> or, consequently, to hold fast by the unconditional value of [[morality]]. He subordinated moral requirements to the advantage at least of a friend,<ref>Aulus Gellius, i. 3. § 23</ref> and had allowed in prosperity the existence of an influence injurious to them. In later times, fault was found with his expression in the ''Callisthenes'', \"life is ruled by fortune, not wisdom\" (''{{lang|la|vitam regit fortuna non sapientia}}'').<ref>Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iii. 10; comp.
