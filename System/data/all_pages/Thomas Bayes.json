W. F. Edwards.</ref> He came from a prominent [[nonconformist]] family from [[Sheffield]]. In 1719, he enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study [[logic]] and theology. On his return around 1722, he assisted his father at the latter's chapel in London before moving to [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], Kent, around 1734. There he was minister of the Mount Sion chapel, until 1752.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/bayesbiog.pdf|title = The Reverend Thomas Bayes FRS- A Biography|publisher= Institute of Mathematical Statistics|accessdate=18 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nHe is known to have published two works in his lifetime, one theological and one mathematical:\n\n#''Divine Benevolence, or an Attempt to Prove That the Principal End of the Divine Providence and Government is the Happiness of His Creatures'' (1731)\n#''An Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defence of the Mathematicians Against the Objections of the Author of The Analyst'' (published anonymously in 1736), in which he defended the logical foundation of [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[calculus]] (\"fluxions\") against the criticism of [[George Berkeley]], author of ''[[The Analyst]]''\n\nIt is speculated that Bayes was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1742<ref>{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/about-us/fellowship/Fellows1660-2007.pdf|title=Lists of Royal Society Fellows 1660–2007|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=19 March 2011|location=London}}</ref> on the strength of the ''Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions'', as he is not known to have published any other mathematical works during his lifetime.\n\nIn his later years he took a deep interest in probability.

He was buried in [[Bunhill Fields]] burial ground in Moorgate, London, where many [[nonconformist]]s lie.\n\n==Bayes's theorem==\n{{main|Bayes'  theorem }}\nBayes's  solution to a problem of [[inverse probability]] was presented in \"[[An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances]]\" which was read to the Royal Society in 1763 after Bayes' death. [[Richard Price]] shepherded the work through this presentation and its publication in the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'' the following year. This was an argument for using a uniform prior distribution for a binomial parameter and not merely a general postulate.<ref>Edwards, A. W. G. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/4615697 \"Commentary on the Arguments of Thomas Bayes,\"] ''Scandinavian Journal of Statistics'', Vol. 5, No. 2 (1978), pp. 116–118; retrieved 6 August 2011</ref> This essay contains a statement of a special case of [[Bayes's theorem]].\n\nIn the first decades of the eighteenth century, many problems concerning the probability of certain events, given specified conditions, were solved. For example: given a specified number of white and black balls in an urn, what is the probability of drawing a black ball? Or the converse: given that one or more balls has been drawn, what can be said about the number of white and black balls in the urn? These are sometimes called \"[[inverse probability]]\" problems.\n\nBayes's \"Essay\" contains his solution to a similar problem posed by [[Abraham de Moivre]], author of ''[[The Doctrine of Chances]]'' (1718).\n\nIn addition, a paper by Bayes on [[asymptotic series]] was published posthumously.\n\n==Bayesianism==\n\n[[Bayesian probability]] is the name given to several related interpretations of [[probability]], which have in common the notion of probability as something like a partial belief, rather than a frequency.  This allows the application of probability to all sorts of propositions rather than just ones that come with a reference class. \"Bayesian\" has been used in this sense since about 1950. Since its rebirth in the 1950s, advancements in computing technology have allowed scientists from many disciplines to pair traditional Bayesian statistics with [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|random walk]] techniques.  The use of the [[Bayes theorem]] has been extended in science and in other fields.<ref>[[John Allen Paulos|Paulos, John Allen]]. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/the-theory-that-would-not-die-by-sharon-bertsch-mcgrayne-book-review.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=thomas%20bayes&st=cse  \"The Mathematics of Changing Your Mind,\"] ''New York Times'' (US). 5 August 2011; retrieved 6 August 2011</ref>\n\nBayes himself might not have embraced the broad interpretation now called Bayesian.  Mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] pioneered and popularised what is now called Bayesian probability.<ref>Stigler, Stephen M. (1986) ''The history of statistics.'', Harvard University press. pp97-98, 131.</ref>  It is difficult to assess Bayes's philosophical views on probability, since his essay does not go into questions of interpretation. There Bayes defines ''probability'' as follows (Definition 5).\n\n{{quote|''The probability of any event is the ratio between the value at which an expectation depending on the happening of the event ought to be computed, and the value of the thing expected upon its happening''}}\n\nIn modern [[utility theory]], expected utility can (with qualifications, because buying risk for small amounts or buying security for big amounts also happen) be taken as the probability of an event times the payoff received in case of that event. Rearranging that to solve for the probability, Bayes's definition results. As Stigler points out,<ref name=\"stigler86history\" /> this is a subjective definition, and does not require repeated events; however, it does require that the event in question be observable, for otherwise it could never be said to have \"happened\". Stigler argues that Bayes intended his results in a more limited way than modern Bayesians. Given Bayes's definition of probability, his result concerning the parameter of a binomial distribution makes sense only to the extent that one can bet on its observable consequences.\n\n==See also==\n{{Bayesian statistics}}\n* [[List of things named after Thomas Bayes]]\n* [[Bayesian inference]]\n* [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]]\n* [[Royal Society]] – Bayes was elected to membership in the Society in 1742; and his nomination letter has been posted with other membership records at the Royal Society website [https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqSearch=RefNo==%27EC%2F1742%2F15%27&dsqCmd=Show.tcl here].
