Brassey is remembered in [[Australia]]'s national capital, [[Canberra]], with Brassey House, now a hotel (originally a [[guest house]]) in the inner suburb of [[Barton, Australian Capital Territory]] completed in 1927 to coincide with the relocation of the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] from [[Melbourne, Victoria]], to Canberra. Brassey House originally offered 45 rooms with shared bathing facilities, for the exclusive use of members of parliament and mid-level government officials relocating to Canberra. During the mid 1960s the government of the day expanded the capacity to 131 rooms and added conference and meeting rooms. It was sold in the mid-1980s to local businessmen and has been operated since as a residential hotel, now with 75 rooms including ensuites. It is said to have been built back-to-front, with the more ornate façade facing Belmore Gardens and its plainer face to Macquarie Street.{{coord|35.3115|S|149.1350|E|dim:500|display=inline}}<ref>[http://www.brassey.net.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=82&Itemid=116 an Elegant Reminder of the Brassey's History], Brassey House, accessed 9 March 2011</ref>\n\n==Sailing activities==\nBrassey's first experience of sailing was whilst he was still at Rugby school.  After a short spell in a hired yacht called ''Zillah'' he started to compete successfully in club events in a yacht called ''Cymba'' (1855).  In 1859 he became the owner of an iron yacht of 120 tons called ''Albatross'', designed by his friend [[St Clare John Byrne]] and built at his father's Canada Works. He was elected as a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron at this time.  In 1866 he ventured into auxiliary steam with the yacht ''Meteor'' and in 1872 used the steam yacht ''Eothen'' to visit Canada - although the vessel proved not to be best suited for this type of work.  ''Eothen'' had formally been owned by the co-founder of P & O Company - [[Arthur Anderson (businessman)|Arthur Anderson]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Brassey|first=Earl|title=Sunbeam RYS voyages & Experiences in Many Waters|year=1917|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=Chapters I,  II  & III}}</ref> \n\nBetween 6 July 1876 and 27 May 1877 Brassey circumnavigated the world in his steam-assisted three-masted topsail-yard schooner [[Sunbeam RYS (1874)|''Sunbeam'']], another yacht designed for him by St Clare Byrne. This voyage is said to have been the first circumnavigation by a private yacht. His son Thomas left the ''Sunbeam'' at [[Rio de Janeiro]] in order to return to school in England. His wife [[Anna Brassey, Baroness Brassey|Annie, Lady Brassey]] (1839–1887), published an account of the cruise entitled ''In The Trades, The Tropics, & The Roaring Forties'', or alternatively ''A Voyage In The Sunbeam:  Our Home On The Ocean For Eleven Months''. In 1880 Brassey's book ''The British Navy'' was published. In 1886, he started [[Brassey's Naval Annual|''The Naval Annual'']] (generally referred to as ''Brassey's Naval Annual'').  He edited ''The Naval Annual'' until 1891. He was succeeded as editor by his son [[Thomas Brassey, 2nd Earl Brassey|Thomas]].\n\nAt the age of 79 Brassey sailed his yacht ''Sunbeam'' to Mudros Bay in order to support the troops as a hospital ship during the ill fated [[Gallipoli Campaign]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bulldog Breed|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/104646040|publisher=The Mirror of Australia|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The 'Sunbeam' as Hospital Ship, July 30th 1915|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/13227|publisher=Imperial War Museum|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref>  \n\n<gallery>\nFile:Steam Yacht Sunbeam.jpg|Sunbeam under full sail\n</gallery>\n\n==Honours and awards==\nBrassey was President of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] from 1879 to 1880. He was conferred with Honorary Membership of the [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]] in 1891.[http://www.iesis.org/honorary-fellows.html]  He served as [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]] from 1908<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28107 |date=7 February 1908 |startpage=891 }}</ref> to 1913.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28777 |date=28 November 1913 |startpage=8799 }}</ref> He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]] in 1906<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27926 |date=26 June 1906 |startpage=4460 }}</ref> and made '''Viscount Hythe''', of Hythe in the County of Kent, and '''Earl Brassey''' in 1911.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28514 |date=18 July 1911 |startpage=5350 }}</ref>\n\nKing [[Kalākaua|David Kalākaua]] of Hawaii bestowed on Brassey the honor \"Knight Commander of the [[Royal Order of Kalākaua]]\".<ref>The Royal Tourist—Kalakaua's Letters Home from Tokio to London. Editor: Richard A. Greer. Date: 10 March 1881</ref>\n\n==Freemasonry==\nHe was a freemason. He was initiated to the craft as an Oxford student. In 1868, he became a member of Abbey Lodge No. 1184 and remained for 48 years. He was also a member of Derwent Lodge No. 4 and a founding brother of Navy Lodge No. 2612. When he was appointed Governor of Victoria, while he had never held any Lodge office, he was appointed Honorary Past Junior Grand Warden. In Melbourne, became a member of Clarke Lodge No. 98 and became its Senior Warden in 1896 and its Worshipful Master in 1897. On 4 May 1896 two days before being installed as Senior Warden, he was installed Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Victoria. His becoming of Grand Master was a bit controversial because many members preferred then-current Grand Master [[Sir William Clarke, 1st Baronet]] to stay and nominated him again. Clarke said that he would like the nomination to be withdrawn if Brassey was willing to serve. Brassey approved and Clarke withdrew the nomination, so Brassey was the sole candidate and therefore elected Grand Master.<ref>http://kenthenderson.com.au/m_papers03.html</ref>\n\n==Family==\n[[Image:Anna Brassey.jpg|thumb|200px|Anna, Lady Brassey.]]\nLord Brassey married firstly [[Anna Brassey, Baroness Brassey|Anna Allnutt]], daughter of John Allnutt, of [[Clapham]], [[Surrey]]. They had one son and four daughters. The third daughter, Lady Muriel Agnes, married [[Gilbert Sackville, 8th Earl De La Warr]], and was the mother of [[Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr]], while the fourth daughter, Lady Marie Adelaide, married [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon]]. Lady Brassey died in September 1887, aged 47. Lord Brassey married secondly Lady Sybil de Vere Capell, daughter of Arthur Capell, Viscount Malden, and sister of George Capell, 7th Earl of Essex, in 1890. They had one daughter. Lord Brassey died in February 1918, aged 82, and was succeeded in the earldom by his only son, [[Thomas Brassey, 2nd Earl Brassey|Thomas]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey}}\n{{Wikisource author|Thomas Brassey}}\n* {{Hansard-contribs | mr-thomas-brassey | the Earl Brassey }}\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Brassey,+Lord | name=Lord Brassey}}\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Brassey,+Thomas+Brassey,+Earl | name=Thomas Brassey}}<!--Same person has multiple IDs at PG as of March 2015-->\n* {{Internet Archive author |search=(\"Lord Brassey\" OR \"Thomas Brassey\" OR \"Brassey, Thomas\") |dname=Thomas Brassey}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{s-bef | before = [[William Ferrand]]<br />[[Arthur William Buller|Sir Arthur William Buller]] }}\n{{s-ttl\n | title = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Devonport]]\n | years = [[Devonport by-election, 1865|Jun 1865]] – [[United Kingdom general election, 1865|Jul 1865]]\n | with  = [[William Ferrand]]\n}}\n{{s-aft | after = [[William Ferrand]]<br />[[John Fleming (Devonport MP)|John Fleming]] }}\n\n{{succession box\n  | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Hastings (UK Parliament constituency)|Hastings]]\n  | with   = [[Frederick North (1800-1869)|Frederick North]] 1868–1869\n  | with2  = [[Ughtred Kay-Shuttleworth, 1st Baron Shuttleworth|Ughtred Kay-Shuttleworth]], 1869–1880\n  | with3  = [[Charles James Murray]] 1880–1883\n  | with4  = [[Henry Bret Ince]] 1883–1885\n  | years  = [[United Kingdom general election, 1868|1868]] – [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886]]\n  | before = [[George Waldegrave-Leslie]]<br/>[[Patrick Francis Robertson]]\n  | after  = [[Wilson Noble]]\n}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Sir Massey Lopes, 3rd Baronet|Sir Massey Lopes, Bt]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Civil Lord of the Admiralty]]|years=1880&ndash;1884 }}\n{{s-aft|after=[[George Wightwick Rendel]]}}\n{{succession box\n | before = [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]\n | title  = [[Secretary to the Admiralty|Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty]]\n | years  = 1884–1885\n | after  = [[Charles Thomson Ritchie, 1st Baron Ritchie of Dundee|Charles Thomson Ritchie]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Lord-in-Waiting]]\n | before = [[Frederick Glyn, 4th Baron Wolverton|The Lord Wolverton]]\n | after  = [[William Waldegrave, 9th Earl Waldegrave|The Earl Waldegrave]]\n | years=1893–1895\n}}\n{{s-gov}}\n{{succession box\n | before = [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|The Earl of Hopetoun]]\n | title  = [[Governor of Victoria]]\n | years  = 1895–1900 |\n | after  = [[George Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe|Sir George Clarke]]\n}}\n{{s-hon}}\n{{succession box\n | before = [[George V of the United Kingdom|HRH The Prince of Wales]]\n | title  = [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]]\n | years  = 1908–1913\n | after  = [[William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp|The Earl Beauchamp]]\n}}\n\n{{s-reg|uk}}\n{{S-new| rows   = 2 | creation}}\n{{S-ttl| title  = [[Earl Brassey]]\n       | years  = 1911 &ndash; 1918 }}\n{{S-aft | rows   = 2 | after = [[Thomas Brassey, 2nd Earl Brassey|Thomas Allnutt Brassey]] }}\n|-\n{{S-ttl| title  = [[Baron Brassey]]\n       | years  = 1886 &ndash; 1918 }}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Governors of Victoria}}\n{{Royal Statistical Society presidents}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| name              = Brassey, Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl\n| alternative names =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = British politician\n| date of birth     = 11 February 1836\n| place of birth    =\n| date of death     = 23 February 1918\n| place of death    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brassey, Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl}}\n[[Category:1836 births]]\n[[Category:1918 deaths]]\n[[Category:Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports]]\n[[Category:Governors of Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Knights of the Order of St John]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) Lords-in-Waiting]]\n[[Category:Lords of the Admiralty]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Royal Statistical Society]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1859–65]] <!-- Devonport -->\n[[Category:UK MPs 1868–74]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1874–80]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1880–85]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1885–86]]\n[[Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Sussex]]\n[[Category:Brassey family|Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey]]\n[[Category:Presidents of Co-operative Congress]]\n[[Category:Alumni of University College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]]\n[[Category:Earls in the Peerage of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Royal Order of Kalākaua]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey"}}}}
