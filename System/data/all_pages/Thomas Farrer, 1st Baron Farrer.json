Born in London, he was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he graduated in 1840. He was called to the bar at [[Lincolns Inn]] in 1844, but retired from practice in the course of a few years. He entered the public service in 1850 as secretary to the naval department (renamed the marine department in 1853) of the [[Board of Trade]]. In 1865 he was-promoted to be one of the joint secretaries of the Board of Trade, and in 1867 became permanent secretary.\n\nHis tenure of this office, which he held for upwards of twenty years, was marked by many reforms and an energetic administration. Not only was he an advanced Liberal in politics, but an uncompromising Free-trader of the strictest school. He was created a baronet for his services at the Board of Trade in 1883, and in 1886 he retired from office. During the same year he published a work entitled ''Free Trade versus Fair Trade'', in which he dealt with an economic controversy then greatly agitating the public mind. He had already, in 1883, written a volume on ''The State in its Relation to Trade''.\n\nIn 1889 he was co-opted by the Progressives as an alderman of the [[London County Council]], of which he became vice-chairman in 1890. His efficiency and ability in this capacity were warmly recognized; but in the course of time divergencies arose between his personal views and those of many of his colleagues.The tendency towards socialistic legislation which became apparent was quite at variance with his principles of individual enterprise and responsibility. He consequently resigned his position.\n\nIn 1893 he was raised to the peerage as [[Baron Farrer]]. From this time forward he devoted much of his energy and leisure to advocating his views at the [[Cobden Club]], the [[Political Economy Club]], on the platform, and in the press. His efforts were especially directed against the opinions of the [[Fair Trade League]], and upon this and other economic controversies he wrote able, clear, and uncompromising letters, which left no doubt that he still adhered to the doctrines of free trade as advocated by its earliest exponents. In 1898 he published his ''Studies in Currency''.\n\nHe was [[President of the Royal Statistical Society]] from 1894 to 1896.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rss.org.uk/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=486|title = Royal Statistical Society Presidents|publisher= Royal Statistical Society|accessdate = 6 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nFarrer married twice, first in 1854 to Frances Erskine (1825–1870), daughter of the historian and orientalist [[William Erskine (historian)|William Erskine]] (1773–1852) and his wife Maitland Mackintosh daughter of [[James Mackintosh|Sir James Mackintosh]] by his first wife.

Noel Maitland Farrer (1867–1929)\n\nFrances died on 15 May 1870.  Farrer remarried in 1873 to his former wife's half-cousin Katherine Euphemia Wedgwood (1839–1931), daughter of [[Hensleigh Wedgwood]] of the [[Wedgwood]] pottery family and his wife Fanny Mackintosh, who was the daughter of Sir James Mackintosh by his second wife.\n\nHe died at [[Abinger Hall]], [[Dorking]] in 1899. He was succeeded in the title by his eldest son [[Thomas Cecil Farrer, 2nd Baron Farrer|Thomas Cecil]] (1859–1940).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{1911}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-reg|uk}}\n{{succession box | title=[[Baron Farrer]]  | before=New Creation  | after=[[Thomas Farrer, 2nd Baron Farrer|Thomas Farrer]] | years=1893&ndash;1899}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n{{Royal Statistical Society presidents}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| name              = Farrer, 1st Baron\n| alternative names =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = British statistician\n| date of birth     = 24 June 1819\n| place of birth    =\n| date of death     = 11 October 1899\n| place of death    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Farrer, 1st Baron}}\n[[Category:1819 births]]\n[[Category:1899 deaths]]\n[[Category:Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of London County Council]]\n[[Category:Permanent Secretaries of the Board of Trade]]\n[[Category:People educated at Eton College]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Royal Statistical Society]]\n[[Category:Progressive Party (London) politicians]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Thomas Farrer, 1st Baron Farrer"}}}}
