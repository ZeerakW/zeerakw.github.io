In 1812 he entered the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he distinguished himself in mathematics. In 1823 he was appointed one of the teachers of mathematics at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and in 1833 he became an [[actuary]] of the Amicable Life Assurance Office, the oldest institution of that kind in London, where he remained until his death in 1851. Galloway was a voluminous, though, for the most part, anonymous writer. His most notable paper, \"On the proper motion of the solar system\", was published in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' of 1847. He contributed largely to the seventh edition of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], and also wrote several scientific papers for the ''Edinburgh Review'' and various scientific journals. His ''Encyclopaedia'' article, \"Probability\", was published separately. He is buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London.\n\n==Notes==\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2014 }}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{EB1911|wstitle=Galloway, Thomas}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite DNB|wstitle=Galloway, Thomas |short=x}}\n* {{Find a Grave|39614713}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata\n| NAME              = Galloway, Thomas\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = British mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 26 February 1796\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 1 November 1851\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Galloway, Thomas}}\n[[Category:Scottish mathematicians]]\n[[Category:1796 births]]\n[[Category:1851 deaths]]\n[[Category:Royal Medal winners]]\n[[Category:19th-century British mathematicians]]\n[[Category:People from South Lanarkshire]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Academics of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]\n[[Category:British actuaries]]\n\n\n{{UK-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Thomas Galloway"}}}}
