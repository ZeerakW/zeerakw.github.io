Cover''' [ˈkoʊvər] (August 7, 1938 &ndash; March 26, 2012) was an information theorist and professor jointly in the Departments of [[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Statistics]] at [[Stanford University]]. He devoted almost his entire career to developing the relationship between information theory and statistics.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHe received his [[B.S.]] in Physics from [[MIT]] in 1960 and [[Ph.D.]] in electrical engineering from [[Stanford University]] in 1964.\n\n==Career==\nCover was past President of the [[IEEE]] [[Information Theory]] Society and was a Fellow of the Institute for Mathematical Statistics and of the IEEE.  He received the Outstanding Paper Award in Information Theory for his 1972 paper Broadcast Channels; he was selected in 1990 as the [[Claude E. Shannon Award|Shannon Lecturer]], regarded as the highest honor in information theory; in 1997 he received the [[IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/hamming_rl.pdf |title=IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal Recipients |publisher=[[IEEE]] |accessdate=May 29, 2011}}</ref> and in 2003 he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].\n\nDuring his 48 year career as a professor of Electrical Engineering and Statistics at Stanford University, he graduated 64 PhD students, authored over 120 journal papers in learning, information theory, statistical complexity, and [[portfolio theory]]; and he coauthored the book ''Elements of Information Theory'', which has become the most widely used textbook as an introduction to the topic since the publication of its first edition in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stanford.edu/group/isl/cgi-bin/wordpress/?page_id=3287 |title=Thomas M.
