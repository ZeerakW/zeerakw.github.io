In it he argued that population multiplies geometrically and food arithmetically; therefore, the population will eventually outstrip the food supply. Between 1798 and 1826 he published six editions of ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', updating each edition to incorporate new material, to address criticism, and to convey changes in his own perspectives on the subject. He wrote the original text in reaction to the optimism of his father and his father's associates (notably Rousseau) regarding the future improvement of society. Malthus also constructed his case as a specific response to writings of [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and of the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743–1794).\n\nThe ''Essay'' gave rise to the '''Malthusian controversy''' during the next decades. The content saw an emphasis on the [[birth rate]] and [[marriage rates]]. The '''neo-Malthusian controversy''', or related debates of many years later, has seen a similar central role assigned to the numbers of children born.<ref>{{cite book|author=G.

In ''The Nature of Rent'' (1815), Malthus had dealt with [[economic rent]], a major concept in classical economics. Ricardo defined a theory of rent in his ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (1817): he regarded rent as value in excess of real production—something caused by ownership rather than by free trade. Rent therefore represented a kind of negative money that landlords could pull out of the production of the land, by means of its scarcity.<ref>''On The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', London: John Murray, Albemarle-Street, by David Ricardo, 1817 (third edition 1821) – Chapter 6, On Profits: paragraph 28, \"Thus, taking the former ...\" and paragraph 33, \"There can, however ...\"</ref> Contrary to this concept, Malthus proposed rent to be a kind of [[economic surplus]].{{cn|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe debate developed over the economic concept of a [[general glut]], and the possibility of failure of [[Say's Law]].

He was drawn into considering political economy in a less restricted sense, which might be adapted to legislation and its multiple objectives, by the thought of Malthus.

''An Essay on the Principle of Population.''

The positive checks include hunger, disease and war; the preventive checks, abortion, birth control, prostitution, postponement of marriage and celibacy.<ref>Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An Essay on the Principle of Population''. Oxford World's Classics reprint. viii</ref>  \n\nIn later editions of his essay, Malthus clarified his view that if society relied on human misery to limit population growth, then sources of misery (''e.g.'', hunger, disease, and war) would inevitably afflict society, as would volatile economic cycles. On the other hand, \"preventive checks\" to population that limited birthrates, such as later marriages, could ensure a higher standard of living for all, while also increasing economic stability.<ref>Essay (1826), I:2.

Difficulties of raising a family eventually reduce the rate of population growth, until the falling population again leads to higher real wages.\n\nIn the second and subsequent editions Malthus put more emphasis on ''moral restraint'' as the best means of easing the poverty of the lower classes.\"<ref>Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798.

Thus, given a limited supply, the Poor Laws force up the price of daily necessities.

In general, Dickens had some Malthusian concerns (evident in ''[[Hard Times]]'' and other novels), and he concentrated his attacks on [[Utilitarianism]] and many of its proponents, like [[Adam Smith|Smith]], and [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]], whom he thought of, along with Malthus, as unjust and inhumane people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paroissien|first=David|title=A companion to Charles Dickens|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rATJ49kDnj8C&pg=PA160&dq#v|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=1-4051-3097-0}}</ref>\n* In [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel, ''[[Brave New World]]'', people generally regard fertility as a nuisance, as ''in vitro'' breeding has enabled the society to maintain its population at precisely the level the controllers want. The women, therefore, carry [[contraceptives]] with them at all times in a \"Malthusian belt\".\n* In the popular television show ''[[Wiseguy]]'', [[Kevin Spacey]] played Mel Proffitt, a self-professed \"Malthusian\" who quotes Thomas Malthus and keeps a bust of his likeness on display.\n* The video game [[Hydrophobia (video game)|Hydrophobia]] tells about some [[eco-terrorists]] who name themselves \"Malthusians\" because their ideology is based on Malthus' theories.\n* At the end of [[Urinetown]], a [[musical theatre|Broadway musical]] about a [[dystopia]] where, in response to a devastating [[drought]], people too poor to pay for restroom usage are killed as a means of population control, Officer Lockstock cries \"Hail, Malthus!\" and is echoed by the cast before the last chords of the [[finale (music)|finale]] play.\n\n==Epitaph==\n[[File:Epitaph of Thomas Malthus.jpg|thumb|right|The [[epitaph]] of Rev.

Supported by a calm but firm conviction of the usefulness of his labours.<br>''Content with the approbation of the wise and good.'' His writings will be a lasting monument of the extent and correctness of his understanding. The spotless integrity of his principles, the equity and candour of his nature, his sweetness of temper, urbanity of manners and tenderness of heart, his benevolence and his piety are still dearer recollections of his family and friends.
