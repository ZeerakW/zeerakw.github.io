He is also co-faculty at the [[New England Complex Systems Institute]]. He was awarded the 2005 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (shared with [[Robert Aumann]]) for \"having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through [[Game theory|game-theory]] analysis\".\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nSchelling was born to John M. Schelling and Zelda M. Ayres in [[Oakland, California]]. Schelling graduated from [[San Diego High]]. He received his [[bachelor's degree]] in economics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1944. He received his [[PhD]] in economics from [[Harvard University]] in 1951.\n\n===Career===\nHe served with the [[Marshall Plan]] in [[Europe]], the [[White House]], and the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]] from 1948 to 1953.<ref name=cv>{{cite web |title=Curriculum Vitae: Thomas C.

He left government to join the economics faculty at [[Yale University]], and in 1958 he was appointed Professor of Economics at Harvard. In 1969 he joined the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at Harvard University.<ref name=cv />\n\nSchelling previously taught for twenty years at Harvard's Kennedy School, where he was the Lucius N. Littauer Professor of Political Economy, as well as conducted research at [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] (IIASA), in [[Laxenburg]], [[Austria]], between 1994 and 1999.\n\nIn 1993 Schelling was awarded the [[NAS Award for Behavior Research Relevant to the Prevention of Nuclear War|Award for Behavior Research Relevant to the Prevention of Nuclear War]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=NASNuclear>{{cite web |title=NAS Award for Behavior Research Relevant to the Prevention of Nuclear War |url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_behavioral_research |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> He also received an honorary doctorate from [[Yale University]] in 2009 as well as an honorary degree from the [[University of Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=6276 |title=Nobel prize winner delivers SCI annual lecture |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==''The Strategy of Conflict'' (1960)==\n''The Strategy of Conflict'', which Schelling published in 1960,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Strategy of Conflict |last=Schelling |first=Thomas C. |coauthors= |year=1980 |edition=Reprint, illustrated and revised. |publisher=Harvard University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-674-84031-7 |page= |pages=309 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=7RkL4Z8Yg5AC&dq=thomas+schelling+strategy+of+conflict&printsec=frontcover#PPP13,M1 |accessdate=September 21, 2010}}</ref> pioneered the study of bargaining and [[strategic management|strategic behavior]] in what Schelling refers to as \"conflict behavior\". It is considered one of the hundred books that have been most influential in the West since 1945.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interleaves.org/~rteeter/grttls.html |title=100 Most Influential Books Since the War (TLS) |publisher=}}</ref> In this book he introduced concepts like [[Focal point (game theory)|focal point]] and [[Risk dominance|credible commitment]]. Chapter headings include \"A Reorientation of Game Theory,\" \"Randomization of Promises and Threats,\" and \"Surprise Attack: A Study of Mutual Distrust.\"\n\nIn an article celebrating Schelling's Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics,<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/11/AR2005101101336.html \"A Nobel Laureate Who's Got Game\"], ''The Washington Post'', October 12, 2005.</ref> [[Michael Kinsley]], ''[[Washington Post]]'' [[op-ed|op‑ed]] columnist and one of Schelling's former students, anecdotally summarizes Schelling's reorientation of game theory thus: \"[Y]ou're standing at the edge of a cliff, chained by the ankle to someone else. You'll be released, and one of you will get a large prize, as soon as the other gives in. How do you persuade the other guy to give in, when the only method at your disposal – threatening to push him off the cliff – would doom you both? Answer: You start dancing, closer and closer to the edge. That way, you don't have to convince him that you would do something totally irrational: plunge him and yourself off the cliff. You just have to convince him that you are prepared to take a higher risk than he is of accidentally falling off the cliff. If you can do that, you win.\"\n\n==''Arms and Influence'' (1966)==\nSchelling's theories about war were extended in ''Arms and Influence'', published in 1966.<ref>[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300002211 Yale University Press]</ref> The blurb states that it \"carries forward the analysis so brilliantly begun in his earlier ''The Strategy of Conflict'' (1960) and ''Strategy and Arms Control'' (with Morton Halperin, 1961), and makes a significant contribution to the growing literature on modern war and [[diplomacy]]\". Chapter headings include ''The Diplomacy of Violence'', ''The Diplomacy of Ultimate Survival'' and ''The Dynamics of Mutual Alarm''.\n\n==''Micromotives and Macrobehavior''==\nIn 1969 and 1971, Schelling published widely cited articles dealing with [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] dynamics and what he termed \"a general theory of [[Tipping point (sociology)|tipping]]\".<ref>Thomas C. Schelling (1969) \"Models of segregation\", ''American Economic Review'', 1969, 59(2), [http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic185351.files/shelling1.pdf 488–493].<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; _____ (1971). \"Dynamic Models of Segregation,\" ''Journal of Mathematical Sociology'', 1(2), pp. [http://oz.berkeley.edu/users/aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf 143–186].</ref> In these papers he showed that a preference that one's neighbors be of the same color, or even a preference for a mixture \"up to some limit\", could lead to total [[residential segregation|segregation]], thus arguing that motives, malicious or not, were indistinguishable as to explaining the phenomenon of complete local separation of distinct groups. He used coins on graph paper to demonstrate his theory by placing pennies and dimes in different patterns on the \"board\" and then moving them one by one if they were in an \"unhappy\" situation.\n\nSchelling's dynamics has been cited as a way of explaining variations that are found in what are regarded as meaningful differences{{spaced ndash}}gender, age, race, ethnicity, language, sexual preference, and religion. Once a cycle of such change has begun, it may have a self-sustaining momentum. His 1978 book ''Micromotives and Macrobehavior'' expanded on and generalized these themes<ref>Thomas C.

He believes [[climate change]] poses a serious threat to developing nations, but that the threat to the United States has been exaggerated. Drawing on his experience with the [[Marshall Plan]] after [[World War&nbsp;II]], he has argued that addressing global warming is a [[bargaining problem]]; if the world is able to reduce emissions, poor countries will receive most of the benefits but rich countries will bear most of the costs.\n\n==Contributions to popular culture==\n[[Stanley Kubrick]] read an article Schelling wrote that included a description of the [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]] novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'', and conversations between Kubrick, Schelling, and George eventually led to the 1964 movie ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]''.<ref>Thomas C.
