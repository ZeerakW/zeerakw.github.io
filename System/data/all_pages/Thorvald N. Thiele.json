Thiele]]\n'''Thorvald Nicolai Thiele''' (24 December 1838 &ndash; 26 September 1910) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[astronomer]], [[actuary]] and [[mathematician]], most notable for his work in [[statistics]], [[interpolation]] and the [[N-body problem#Three-body problem|three-body problem]].  He was the first to propose a mathematical theory of [[Brownian motion]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  Thiele introduced the [[cumulant]]s and (in Danish) the [[likelihood function]]. Thiele was named by [[Ronald Fisher]], in his (short) list of the greatest statisticians of all time.<ref>\n* Neyman, J. [1956]: ‘Note on an Article by Sir Ronald Fisher,’ ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'', Series B (Methodological), 18, pp. 288–94.\n</ref>\n\nIn the early 1900s he also developed and proposed a generalisation of [[approval voting]] to multiple winner elections called [[Sequential proportional approval voting]],<ref>http://journals.lub.lu.se/index.php/st/article/view/1949/1528&usg=ALkJrhiuUQ1zCqZHnca_-iAmk1KpNqMtmg</ref> which was briefly used for party lists in [[Sweden]] when proportional representation was introduced in 1909.\n\nThiele also was a founder and Mathematical Director of the [[Codan A/S|Hafnia Insurance Company]] and led the founding of the [[Danish Society of Actuaries]]. It was through his [[insurance]] work that he came into contact with fellow mathematician [[Jørgen Pedersen Gram]].\n\nThiele was the father of [[Holger Thiele]].\n\n[[Asteroid]]s [[843 Nicolaia]] (found by his son) and [[1586 Thiele]] are named in his honour.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Founders of statistics]]\n* [[Gram–Charlier series]]\n* [[Kalman filter]]\n* [[Least squares]]\n* [[Thiele's interpolation formula]]\n* [[Time series]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|author=[http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~steffen/ Steffen L.
