A self-taught [[mathematician]], he earned a living by teaching mathematics while still a youth. He had already published two original geometrical works when, in 1746, he entered [[Johann Homann|J.B. Homann]]'s cartographic establishment at [[Nuremberg]]. Here he introduced many improvements in [[mapmaking]], and gained a scientific reputation which led (in 1751) to his election to the chair of economy and mathematics at the [[University of Göttingen]]. In 1754 he became superintendent of the observatory, where he worked until his death in 1762.\n\nHis first important astronomical work was a careful investigation of the [[libration]] of the [[moon]] (''Kosmographische Nachrichten'', Nuremberg, 1750), and his chart of the full moon (published in 1775) was unsurpassed for half a century. But his fame rests chiefly on his [[lunar theory|lunar tables]], communicated in 1752, with new solar tables to the ''Königliche Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen'' (Royal Society of Sciences and Humanities at Göttingen), and published in their transactions. In 1755 he submitted to the British government an amended body of manuscript tables, which [[James Bradley]] compared with the [[Greenwich]] observations. He found these to be sufficiently accurate to determine the moon's position to 5\", and consequently the [[longitude]] at sea to about half a degree. An improved set was later published in London (1770), as also the theory (''Theoria lunae juxta systema Newtonianum'', 1767) upon which the tables are based. His widow, with whom they were sent to England, received in consideration from the British government a grant of £3000. Appended to the London edition of the solar and lunar tables are two short tracts, one on determining longitude by [[method of lunar distances|lunar distance]]s, together with a description of the [[reflecting instrument#Reflecting circles|reflecting circle]] (invented by Mayer in 1752), the other on a formula for [[atmospheric refraction]], which applies a remarkably accurate correction for temperature.\n\nMayer left behind him a considerable quantity of manuscript material, part of which was collected by [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|G. C. Lichtenberg]] and published in one volume (''Opera inedita'', Göttingen, 1775). It contains an easy and accurate method for calculating [[eclipse]]s, an essay on colour, in which three primary colours are recognized, a catalogue of 998 [[zodiac]]al stars, and a memoir, the earliest of any real value, on the [[proper motion]] of eighty stars, originally communicated to the Göttingen Royal Society in 1760. The remaining manuscripts included papers on atmospheric refraction from 1755, on the [[Planetary orbit|motion]] of [[Mars]] as affected by the [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s of [[Jupiter]] and the [[Earth]] (1756), and on [[Earth's magnetic field|terrestrial magnetism]] (1760 and 1762). In these last Mayer sought to explain the magnetic action of the earth by a modification of [[Euler]]'s hypothesis, and made the first really definite attempt to establish a mathematical theory of magnetic action (C. Hansteen, ''Magnetismus der Erde'', I, 283). In 1881 [[Ernst Friedrich Wilhelm Klinkerfues|Ernst Klinkerfues]] published photo-lithographic reproductions of Mayer's local charts and general map of the moon. His star catalogue was re-edited by [[Francis Baily]] in 1830 (''Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society'' IV, 391) and by [[Georg Friedrich Julius Arthur von Auwers|Arthur Auwers]] in 1894.\n\nHonors: Lunar crater [[T.
