He came from an established Scottish family composed of army officers, civil servants, scholars, and administrators. His father, Sir George Udny Yule (1813–1886) was a brother of the noted [[oriental studies|orientalist]] Sir [[Henry Yule]] (1820–1889).\n\nIn 1899, Yule married May Winifred. The marriage was annulled in 1912, there having been no children.<ref name=\"annullment\">annulment: Yates, 1952</ref>\n\n== Education and teaching ==\nUdny Yule was educated at [[Winchester College]] and at the age of 16 at [[University College London]] where he read engineering. After a year in [[Bonn]] doing research in experimental physics under [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]], Yule returned to University College in 1893 to work as a demonstrator for [[Karl Pearson]], one of his former teachers. Pearson was beginning to work in statistics and Yule followed him into this new field. Yule progressed to an assistant professorship but he left in 1899 to a better-paid position as secretary to an examination board. He continued to publish articles and also a very influential textbook, ''Introduction to the Theory of Statistics'' (1911); his book was based on the lectures he gave as the [[William Newmarch|Newmarch]] lecturer at University College.\n\nIn 1912 Yule moved to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] to a newly created Lectureship in Statistics and he remained in Cambridge for the rest of his life. During the First World War Yule worked for the army and then for the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]]. A [[heart attack]] in 1931 left him semi-invalided and led to his early retirement. His flow of publications almost ceased but, in the 1940s he found new interests, one of which led to a book, ''The Statistical Study of Literary Vocabulary''.\n\n== Scholarship ==\nYule was a prolific writer, the highlight of his publications being perhaps the [[textbook]] ''Introduction to the Theory of Statistics'', which went through fourteen editions. He was active in the [[Royal Statistical Society]], was awarded its [[Guy Medal]] in Gold in 1911, and served as its [[President of the Royal Statistical Society|president]] in 1924-26.\n\nYule’s first paper on statistics appeared in 1895: ''\"On the Correlation of Total Pauperism with Proportion of Out-relief\"''. Yule was interested in applying statistical techniques to social problems and he quickly became a member of the [[Royal Statistical Society]]. For many years the only members interested in mathematical statistics were Yule, [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth|Edgeworth]] and [[Arthur Lyon Bowley|Bowley]]. In 1897&ndash;99 Yule wrote important papers on [[correlation]] and [[linear regression|regression]]); after 1900 he worked on a parallel theory of association. His approach to association was quite different from Pearson’s and relations between them deteriorated. Yule had broad interests and his collaborators included the agricultural [[meteorologist]] [[Reginald Hawthorn Hooker|R. H. Hooker]], the medical statistician [[Major Greenwood]] and the agricultural scientist Sir [[Frank Engledow]]. Yule’s sympathy towards the newly rediscovered [[Mendelian]] theory of [[genetics]] led to several papers.\n\nIn the 1920s Yule wrote three influential papers on [[time series analysis]], \"On the time-correlation problem\" (1921), a critique of the variate difference method, an investigation of a form of spurious correlation<ref>[http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~econ508/Papers/yule26.pdf \"Why Do We Sometimes Get Nonsense Correlations between Time-series?\"]</ref> (1926) and \"On a Method of Investigating Periodicities in Disturbed Series, with Special Reference to Wolfer's Sunspot Numbers\" (1927), which used an autoregressive model to model the [[sunspot]] time series instead of the established periodogram method of [[Arthur Schuster|Schuster]].\n\nIn 1925 Yule published the paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Evolution, based on the Conclusions of Dr. J. C. Willis, F.R.S.\",<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Yule | first1 = G. U. | title = A Mathematical Theory of Evolution, Based on the Conclusions of Dr. J. C.

Simon]] dubbed the resulting distribution the [[Yule distribution]] in his honor.\n\n== Assessment ==\n[[Frank Yates]] culminated his 1952 obituary of Yule by saying:\n<blockquote>\n“To summarize we may, I think, justly conclude that though Yule did not fully develop any completely new branches of statistical theory, he took the first steps in many directions which were later to prove fruitful lines for further progress… He can indeed rightly claim to be one of the pioneers of modern statistics”.<ref name=\"pioneer of modern statistics\">pioneer of modern statistics: Yates 1952, p. 320</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nYule made important contributions to the theory and practice of [[correlation]], [[regression analysis|regression]], and association, as well as to [[time series]] analysis. He pioneered the use of [[preferential attachment]] stochastic processes to explain the origin of power law distribution. The [[Yule distribution]], a discrete [[power law]], is named after him.\n\nAlthough Yule taught at Cambridge for twenty years, he had little impact on the development of statistics there. [[M. S. Bartlett]] recalled him as a \"mentor\" but his famous association with [[Maurice Kendall]], who revised the ''Introduction to the Theory of Statistics'', only came about after Kendall had graduated.\n\n==Selected works==\n\n*{{Cite journal | last1 = Yule | first1 = G.
