He was called \"the [[geometer]]\".\n\n==Biography==\nHe originated from a noble family of Ireland, where his name was Feirgil, and is said to have been a descendant of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]]. Feirgil was probably educated at the Iona monastery.<ref>Clancy, Thomas Owen and Márkus, Gilbert. ''Iona: The Earliest Poetry of a Celtic Monastery'', p.17, Edinburgh, Edinburgh University, 1995</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Annals of the Four Masters]]\" and the \"[[Annals of Ulster]]\" he is mentioned as Abbot of [[Abbey of Aghaboe|Aghaboe]],<ref name=turner>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15353d.htm Turner, William. \"St. Vergilius of Salzburg.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 19 May 2013]</ref> in [[County Laois]], where he was known as \"the Geometer\" because of his knowledge of geography.<ref name=stevens>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/VIRGILIU.HTM Stevens, Clifford. ''The One Year Book of Saints'', Our Sunday Visitor Publishing Division, Our Sunday Visitor, Inc., Huntington, Indiana]</ref>\n\nAround 745 he left Ireland, intending to visit the Holy land, but, like many of his countrymen, who seemed to have adopted this practice as a work of piety, he settled down in France, where he was received with great favour by [[Pippin the Younger]] then [[Mayor of the Palace]] under [[Childeric III]] of [[Franconia]].  After spending two years at [[Cressy, Seine-Maritime|Cressy]], near [[Compiègne]], he went to [[Bavaria]], at the invitation of [[Odilo of Bavaria|Duke Odilo]], where he founded the monastery of [[Chiemsee]], and within a year or two was made Abbot of St. Peter's at [[Salzburg]]. Among his notable accomplishments was the conversion of the Alpine Slavs; he also sent missionaries to Hungary.<ref name=stevens/>\n\nIt was while Abbot of St. Peter's that he came into collision with [[Saint Boniface]]. A priest having, through ignorance, conferred the [[Sacrament]] of [[Baptism]] using, in place of the correct formula, the words \"Baptizo te in nomine patria et filia et spiritu sancta\", Vergilius held that the sacrament had been validly conferred, but Boniface complained to [[Pope Zachary]]. The latter, however, decided in favour of Vergilius.  Later on, Boniface accused Vergilius of spreading discord between himself and Duke Odilo of Bavaria and of teaching a doctrine in regard to the [[spherical Earth|rotundity of the earth]], which was \"contrary to the Scriptures\". Pope Zachary's decision in this case was that \"if it shall be clearly established that he professes belief in another world and other people existing beneath the earth, or in [another] sun and moon there, thou art to hold a council, and deprive him of his sacerdotal rank, and expel him from the church.\"<ref>''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica|MGH]]'', Epistolae Selectae, 1, 80, pp. 178–9 [http://www.dmgh.de/]; translation in M. L. W. Laistner, ''Thought and Letters in Western Europe'', pp. 184–5.; see also Jaffe, ''Biblioth. rerum germ.'', III, 191</ref> Unfortunately we no longer possess the treatise in which Vergilius expounded his doctrine. Two things, however, are certain: first, that there was involved the problem of [[original sin]] and the universality of redemption; secondly, that Vergilius succeeded in freeing himself from the charge of teaching a doctrine contrary to Scripture. It is likely that Boniface, already biased against Vergilius because of the preceding case, misunderstood him, taking it for granted, perhaps, that if there are [[antipodes]], the \"other race of men\" are not descendants of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and were not redeemed by Christ.<ref name=turner/>\n\nAfter the martyrdom of Boniface, Vergilius was made [[Archdiocese of Salzburg|Bishop of Salzburg]] in 766 or 767 and laboured successfully for the upbuilding of his diocese as well as for the [[Germanic Christianity|spread of Christianity]] in neighbouring [[Germanic paganism|heathen]] countries, especially in [[Karantania|Carinthia]].<ref name=turner/> He died at Salzburg, 27 November 784.\n\n==Veneration==\nIn 1233 he was canonized by [[Gregory IX]].<ref name=stevens/> His doctrine that the earth is a sphere was derived from the teaching of ancient geographers, and his belief in the existence of the antipodes was probably influenced by the accounts which the ancient Irish voyagers gave of their journeys. This, at least, is the opinion of Rettberg (''Kirchengesch. Deutschlands'', II, 236).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commonscatinline|Virgilius of Salzburg}}\n==Sources==\n*Laistner, M.L.W.
