His father was Igor Vladimirovich Arnold (1900–1948), a mathematician. His mother was Nina Alexandrovna Arnold (1909–1986, ''[[Name at birth|née]]'' Isakovich), an art historian.<ref name=obituary>[[Sabir Gusein-Zade|Gusein-Zade, S. M.]]; Varchenko, A.

(''in Russian'')</ref>\n\nWhile a student of [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] at [[Moscow State University]] and still a teenager, Arnold showed in 1957 that any continuous function of several variables can be constructed with a finite number of two-variable functions, thereby solving [[Hilbert's thirteenth problem]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Robertz|title=Formal Algorithmic Elimination for PDEs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kvPBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA192|date=13 October 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-11445-3|page=192}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating from Moscow State University in 1959, he worked there until 1986 (a professor since 1965), and then at [[Steklov Mathematical Institute]].\n\nHe became an academician of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union]] ([[Russian Academy of Science]] since 1991) in 1990.<ref name=\"GRE\">[[Great Russian Encyclopedia]] (2005), [[Moscow]]: Bol'shaya Rossiyskaya Enciklopediya Publisher, vol. 2.</ref> Arnold can be said to have initiated the theory of [[symplectic topology]] as a distinct discipline. The [[Arnold conjecture]] on the number of fixed points of [[Hamiltonian symplectomorphism]]s and [[Lagrangian intersection]]s were also a major motivation in the development of [[Floer homology]].\n\nIn 1999 he suffered a serious bike accident in Paris, resulting in [[traumatic brain injury]], and though he regained consciousness after a few weeks, he had amnesia and for some time could not even recognize his wife at the hospital,<ref>Arnold: Yesterday and Long Ago (2010)</ref> but he went on to make a good recovery.<ref>Polterovich and Scherbak (2011)</ref>\n\nArnold worked at the Steklov Mathematical Institute in [[Moscow]] and at [[Paris Dauphine University]] up until his death. {{As of|2006}} he was reported to have the highest [[citation index]] among Russian scientists,<ref>[http://www.scientific.ru/whoiswho/gt1000_6.html List of Russian Scientists with High Citation Index]</ref> and [[h-index]] of 40.\n\nTo his students and colleagues Arnold was known also for his sense of humour.

His writings present a fresh, often [[geometric]] approach to traditional mathematical topics like [[ordinary differential equation]]s, and his many textbooks have proved influential in the development of new areas of mathematics. The standard criticism about Arnold's pedagogy is that his books \"are beautiful treatments of their subjects that are appreciated by experts, but too many details are omitted for students to learn the mathematics required to prove the statements that he so effortlessly justifies.\" His defense is that his books are meant to teach the subject to \"those who truly wish to understand it\" (Chicone, 2007).<ref>Carmen Chicone (2007), Book review of \"Ordinary Differential Equations\", by Vladimir I. Arnold. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2006. ''SIAM Review'' '''49'''(2):335–336. ''(Chicone mentions the criticism but does not agree with it.)''</ref>\n\nArnold was an outspoken critic of the trend towards high levels of abstraction in mathematics during the middle of the last century. He had very strong opinions on how this approach—which was most popularly implemented by the [[Bourbaki]] school in France—initially had a negative impact on French [[mathematical education]], and then later on that of other countries as well.<ref>See [http://pauli.uni-muenster.de/~munsteg/arnold.html] and other essays in [http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/~arnsem/Arnold/].</ref><ref name=\"interview1\">[http://www.ams.org/notices/199704/arnold.pdf An Interview with Vladimir Arnol'd], by S.

KAM theory shows that, despite the perturbations, such systems can be stable over an infinite period of time, and specifies what the conditions for this are.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Poincare's Prize: The Hundred-Year Quest to Solve One of Math's Greatest Puzzles|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iEBOce-4S2EC&pg=PT39|publisher = Penguin|date = 2008-07-29|isbn = 9781440634284|first = George G.|last = Szpiro}}</ref>\n\n===Singularity theory===\nIn 1965, Arnold attended [[René Thom]]'s seminar on [[catastrophe theory]].
