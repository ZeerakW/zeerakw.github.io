He received his master's degree in mathematics at the [[Samarkand State University|Uzbek State University]], [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek SSR]] in 1958 and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in [[statistics]] at the Institute of Control Sciences, [[Moscow]] in 1964. He worked at this institute from 1961 to 1990 and became Head of the Computer Science Research Department.<ref name=Frank12 />\n\n==Academic career==\nAt the end of 1990, Vladimir Vapnik moved to the [[United States|USA]] and joined the Adaptive Systems Research Department at [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] [[Bell Labs]] in [[Holmdel, New Jersey]]. While at AT&T, Vapnik and his colleagues developed the theory of the [[support vector machine]]. They demonstrated its performance on a number of problems of interest to the [[machine learning]] community, including [[handwriting recognition]]. The group later became the Image Processing Research Department of [[AT&T Laboratories]] when AT&T spun off [[Lucent Technologies]] in 1996. Vapnik left AT&T in 2002 and joined [[NEC]] Laboratories in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he worked in the Machine Learning group. He also holds a Professor of Computer Science and Statistics position at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] since 1995, as well as a position as Professor of Computer Science at [[Columbia University]], [[New York City]] since 2003.<ref>{{cite book |last=Scholkopf  |first=Bernhard  et al (eds)|date=2013 |title=Empirical Inference: Festschrift in Honor of Vladimir N.
