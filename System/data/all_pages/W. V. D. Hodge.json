With help from [[E. T. Whittaker]], whose son [[J. M. Whittaker]] was a college friend, he then took the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]]. At Cambridge he fell under the influence of the geometer [[H. F. Baker]].\n\nIn 1926 he took up a teaching position at the [[University of Bristol]], and began work on the interface between the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]], particularly problems posed by [[Francesco Severi]], and the topological methods of [[Solomon Lefschetz]]. This made his reputation, but led to some initial scepticism on the part of Lefschetz. According to Atiyah's memoir, Lefschetz and Hodge in 1931 had a meeting in [[Max Newman]]'s rooms in Cambridge, to try to resolve issues. In the end Lefschetz was convinced.\n\nIn 1930 Hodge was awarded a Research Fellowship at [[St. John's College, Cambridge]]. He spent a year 1931–2 at [[Princeton University]], where Lefschetz was, visiting also [[Oscar Zariski]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. At this time he was also assimilating [[de Rham's theorem]], and defining the [[Hodge star]] operation. It would allow him to define [[harmonic form]]s and so refine the de Rham theory.\n\nOn his return to Cambridge, he was offered a University Lecturer position in 1933. He became the [[Lowndean Professor]] of Astronomy and Geometry at [[Cambridge]], a position he held from 1936 to 1970. He was the first head of [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|DPMMS]].\n\nHe was the Master of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] from 1958 to 1970, and vice-president of the [[Royal Society]] from 1959 to 1965.  He was knighted in 1959. Amongst other honours, he received the [[Adams Prize]] in 1937 and the [[Copley Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1974.\n\n==Work==\nThe [[Hodge index theorem]] was a result on the [[intersection number]] theory for curves on an [[algebraic surface]]: it determines the [[metric signature|signature]] of the corresponding [[quadratic form]]. This result was sought by the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]], but was proved by the topological methods of [[Lefschetz]].\n\n''The Theory and Applications of Harmonic Integrals''<ref>{{cite journal|author=Struik, D. J.|author-link=Dirk Jan Struik|title=Review: W. V. D. Hodge, ''The theory and applications of harmonic integrals''|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|date=1944|volume=50|issue=1|pages=43–45|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183505582|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1944-08054-3}}</ref> summed up Hodge's development during the 1930s of his general theory. This starts with the existence for any [[Kähler metric]] of a theory of [[Laplacian]]s – it applies to an [[algebraic variety]] V (assumed complex, projective and non-singular) because [[projective space]] itself carries such a metric. In [[de Rham cohomology]] terms, a cohomology class of degree ''k'' is represented by a ''k''-form α on V('''C'''). There is no unique representative; but by introducing the idea of ''harmonic form'' (Hodge still called them 'integrals'), which are solutions of [[Laplace's equation]], one can get unique α. This has the important, immediate consequence of splitting up\n\n:''H''<sup>''k''</sup>(V('''C'''), '''C''')\n\ninto subspaces\n\n:''H''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup>\n\naccording to the number ''p'' of [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] differentials ''dz<sup>i</sup>'' wedged to make up α (the cotangent space being spanned by the ''dz<sup>i</sup>'' and their complex conjugates). The dimensions of the subspaces are the [[Hodge number]]s.\n\nThis ''Hodge decomposition'' has become a fundamental tool. Not only do the dimensions h<sup>''p'',''q''</sup> refine the [[Betti number]]s, by breaking them into parts with identifiable geometric meaning; but the decomposition itself, as a varying 'flag' in a complex vector space, has a meaning in relation with [[moduli problem]]s. In broad terms, Hodge theory contributes both to the discrete and the continuous classification of algebraic varieties.\n\nFurther developments by others led in particular to an idea of [[mixed Hodge structure]] on singular varieties, and to deep analogies with [[étale cohomology]].\n\n==Hodge conjecture==\n\nThe [[Hodge conjecture]] on the 'middle' spaces H<sup>''p'',''p''</sup> is still unsolved, in general. It is one of the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]] set up by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]].\n\n==Exposition==\nHodge also wrote, with [[Daniel Pedoe]], a three-volume work ''Methods of Algebraic Geometry'', on classical algebraic geometry, with much concrete content – illustrating though what [[Élie Cartan]] called 'the debauch of indices', in its component notation. According to Atiyah, this was intended to update and replace H. F. Baker's ''Principles of Geometry''.\n\n==Publications==\n*{{Citation | last1=Hodge | first1=W. V.
