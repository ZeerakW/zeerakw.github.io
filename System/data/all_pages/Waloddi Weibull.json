He was a cousin of the historian brothers [[Lauritz Weibull|Lauritz]], [[Carl Gustaf Weibull|Carl Gustaf]] and [[Curt Weibull]], of whom especially the first is noteworthy for introducing a stricter criticism in the interpretation of medieval Scandinavian sources.\n\nHe joined the [[Swedish Coast Guard]] in 1904 as a midshipman. Weibull moved up the ranks with promotion to sublieutenant in 1907, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] in 1916 and [[Major]] in 1940. While in the coast guard he took courses at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]]. In 1924 he graduated and became a full professor.<ref name=\"Broberg p142\"/> Weibull obtained his [[doctorate]] from the [[University of Uppsala]] in 1932.<ref name=\"Broberg p142\"/> He was employed in Swedish and [[Germany|German]] industry as a consulting engineer.\n\nIn 1914, while on expeditions to the [[Mediterranean]], the [[Caribbean]] and the [[Pacific]] Ocean on the research ship ''Albatross'', Weibull wrote his first paper on the propagation of explosive waves. He developed the technique of using explosive charges to determine the type of ocean bottom [[sediments]] and their thickness.<ref name=\"Broberg p144-6\">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=G1vPG891tBsC&pg=PA141&dq=waloddi+weibull |title= Fracture Research in Retrospect: An anniversary volume in honour of G.R.

The Great Gold Medal from the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences]] was personally presented to him by [[Monarch|King]] [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden]] in 1978.<ref name=\"Broberg p142\"/>\n\nWeibull died on October 12, 1979 in [[Annecy]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Broberg p143\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WeibullDistribution.html Weibull Distribution]\n*[http://www.barringer1.com/ barringer1.com  -   A reliability web site with lots of information and all of Weibull's papers]\n*A photograph of [http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/people/weibull.gif Weibull] on the [http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/people/welcome.htm Portraits of Statisticians] page.\n\n{{Authority control|VIAF=47557799}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Weibull, Waloddi\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = Swedish mathematician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = 18 June 1887\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Annecy]], France\n| DATE OF DEATH     = 12 October 1979\n| PLACE OF DEATH    = Annecy, France\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weibull, Waloddi}}\n[[Category:1887 births]]\n[[Category:1979 deaths]]\n[[Category:Swedish mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Swedish scientists]]\n[[Category:Swedish statisticians]]\n[[Category:Probability theorists]]\n[[Category:Royal Institute of Technology academics]]\n[[Category:Uppsala University alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Waloddi Weibull"}}}}
