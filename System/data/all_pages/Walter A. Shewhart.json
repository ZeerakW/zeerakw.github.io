Edwards Deming]] said of him:\n\n:''As a statistician, he was, like so many of the rest of us, self-taught, on a good background of physics and mathematics.''{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nBorn in [[New Canton, Illinois]] to Anton and Esta Barney Shewhart, he attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] before being awarded his doctorate in [[physics]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1917.\nHe married Edna Elizabeth Hart, daughter of William Nathaniel and Isabelle \"Ibie\" Lippencott Hart on August 4, 1914 in Pike County, Illinois.\n\n==Work on industrial quality==\n\n[[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]]’s engineers had been working to improve the reliability of their [[transmission systems]].  In order to impress government regulators of this natural monopoly with the high quality of their service, Shewhart's first assignment was to improve the voice clarity of the carbon transmitters in the company's telephone handsets.  Later he applied his statistical methods to the final installation of central station switching systems, then to factory production. When Dr. Shewhart joined the [[Western Electric|Western Electric Company]] Inspection Engineering Department at the [[Hawthorne Works]] in 1918, [[Quality (business)|industrial quality]] was limited to inspecting finished products and removing defective items. That all changed on May 16, 1924. Dr. Shewhart's boss, [[George D. Edwards]], recalled: \"Dr. Shewhart prepared a little memorandum only about a page in length. About a third of that page was given over to a simple diagram which we would all recognize today as a schematic [[control chart]]. That diagram, and the short text which preceded and followed it, set forth all of the essential principles and considerations which are involved in what we know today as process quality control.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.porticus.org/bell/westernelectric_history.html#Western%20Electric%20-%20A%20Brief%20History |title=Western Electric - A Brief History |publisher=The Porticus Centre |accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref> Shewhart's work pointed out the importance of reducing variation in a manufacturing process and the understanding that continual process-adjustment in reaction to non-conformance actually increased variation and degraded quality.\n\nShewhart framed the problem in terms of [[Common- and special-causes|assignable-cause]] and [[Common- and special-causes|chance-cause]] variation and introduced the control chart as a tool for distinguishing between the two. Shewhart stressed that bringing a production process into a state of [[statistical control]], where there is only [[Common- and special-causes|chance-cause]] variation, and keeping it in control, is necessary to predict future output and to manage a process economically. Dr. Shewhart created the basis for the control chart and the concept of a state of [[statistical control]] by carefully designed experiments. While Dr. Shewhart drew from pure mathematical statistical theories, he understood data from physical processes never produce a \"[[normal distribution]] curve\" (a [[Gaussian distribution]], also commonly referred to as a \"[[Normal distribution|bell curve]]\"). He discovered that observed variation in manufacturing data did not always behave the same way as data in nature ([[Brownian motion]] of particles). Dr. Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display controlled variation that is natural to the process, while others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the process causal system at all times.<ref>{{cite book |last=Neave |first=Henry R. |author2=British Deming Association  |title=Why SPC?  |publisher=SPC Press |location=Knoxville, Tennessee |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-945320-17-3}}</ref>\n\nShewhart worked to advance the thinking at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] from their foundation in 1925 until his retirement in 1956, publishing a series of papers in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''.\n\nHis work was summarized in his book ''Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product'' (1931).\n\nShewhart’s charts were adopted by the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM) in 1933 and advocated to improve production during [[World War II]] in American War Standards Z1.1-1941, Z1.2-1941 and Z1.3-1942.\n\n==Later work==\n\nFrom the late  1930s onwards, Shewhart's interests expanded out from industrial quality to wider concerns in [[science]] and [[statistical inference]]. The title of his second book ''Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control'' (1939) asks the audacious question: ''What can [[statistical practice]], and [[science]] in general, learn from the experience of industrial quality control?''\n\nShewhart's approach to [[statistics]] was radically different from that of many of his contemporaries. He possessed a strong [[operationalism|operationalist]] outlook, largely absorbed from the writings of [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher [[C. I. Lewis|C.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Lewis]], and this influenced his statistical practice. In particular, he had read [[C. I. Lewis|Lewis's]] ''Mind and the World Order'' many times. Though he lectured in [[England]] in 1932 under the sponsorship of [[Karl Pearson]] (another committed [[operationalism|operationalist]]) his ideas attracted little enthusiasm within the English statistical tradition. The [[British Standard]]s nominally based on his work, in fact, diverge on serious philosophical and methodological issues from his practice.\n\nHis more conventional work led him to formulate the statistical idea of [[tolerance interval]]s and to propose his data presentation rules, which are listed below:\n\n#Data have no meaning apart from their context.\n#Data contain both signal and noise. To be able to extract information, one must separate the signal from the noise within the data.\n\nWalter Shewhart visited [[India]] in 1947-48 under the sponsorship of [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P. C. Mahalanobis]] of the [[Indian Statistical Institute]]. Shewhart toured the country, held conferences and stimulated interest in statistical quality control among Indian industrialists.<ref>[http://www.isical.ac.in/history.html \"A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE INDIAN STATISTICAL INSTITUTE\"]</ref>\n\nHe died at [[Troy Hills, New Jersey]] in 1967.\n\n==Influence==\n\nIn 1938 his work came to the attention of [[physicist]]s [[W. Edwards Deming]] and [[Raymond T. Birge]]. The two had been deeply intrigued by the issue of measurement error in science and had published a landmark paper in ''Reviews of Modern Physics'' in 1934. On reading of Shewhart's insights, they wrote to the journal to wholly recast their approach in the terms that Shewhart advocated.\n\nThe encounter began a long collaboration between Shewhart and [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] that involved work on [[productivity]] during [[World War II]] and [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]]'s championing of Shewhart's ideas in [[Japan]] from 1950 onwards. [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] developed some of Shewhart's methodological proposals around [[scientific inference]] and named his synthesis the [[Shewhart cycle]].\n\n==Achievements and honours==\n\nIn his obituary for the [[American Statistical Association]], [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] wrote of Shewhart:\n\n<blockquote>''As a man, he was gentle, genteel, never ruffled, never off his dignity. He knew disappointment and frustration, through failure of many writers in mathematical statistics to understand his point of view.''</blockquote>\n\nHe was founding editor of the ''Wiley Series in Mathematical Statistics'', a role that he maintained for twenty years, always championing [[freedom of speech]] and confident to publish views at variance with his own.\n\nHis honours included:\n\n* Founding member, fellow and president of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]];\n* Founding member, first honorary member and first [[Shewhart Medal]]ist of the [[American Society for Quality]];\n* Fellow and [[President of the American Statistical Association]];\n* Fellow of the [[International Statistical Institute]];\n* Honorary fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society]];\n* [[Holley medal]] of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]];\n* Honorary Doctor of Science, [[Indian Statistical Institute]], [[Calcutta]].\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*[[Control chart]]\n*[[Common cause and special cause]]\n*[[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Books===\n<!--(1917)  A study of the accelerated motion of small drops through a viscous medium  -->\n*{{cite book |last=Shewhart |first=Walter A[ndrew]. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=A study of the accelerated motion of small drops through a viscous medium |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1917 |publisher=Press of the New Era Printing Company |location=[[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Pennsylvania|PA]] |language= |isbn= |oclc=26000657 |doi= |id= {{LCC|QC189 .S5}} |pages=433 p. |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |lccn=18007524 }}\n<!--(1931) Economic control of quality of manufactured product-->\n*{{cite book |last=Shewhart |first=Walter A[ndrew]. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Economic control of quality of manufactured product |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1931 |publisher=D.
