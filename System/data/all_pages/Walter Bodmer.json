In 1985 he chaired a [[Royal Society]] committee which wrote ''The Bodmer Report''; this has been credited{{by whom|date=October 2015}} with starting the movement for the [[Public awareness of science|public understanding of science]].<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019050128/http://royalsociety.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=5971|url=http://royalsociety.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=5971|publisher=Royal Society|title=Public Understanding of Science, 1985|archivedate=2013-10-19}}</ref>\n\nBodmer was one of the first to suggest the idea of the [[Human Genome Project]].<ref name=hugo>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408001521/http://www.hugo-international.org/abt_hugopresidents.php|archivedate=2015-04-08|title=HUGO presidents|url=http://www.hugo-international.org/abt_hugopresidents.php}}</ref> In 1987 he received the [[Ellison-Cliffe Lecture|Ellison-Cliffe Medal]] from the [[Royal Society of Medicine]]. He was the director of research (1979–1991) and then [[Director General]] (1991–1996) of the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]]. He was also [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Salford]], [[England]] (1995–2005; succeeded by [[Martin Harris (academic)|Sir Martin Harris]]) and [[Principal (university)|Principal]] of [[Hertford College, Oxford]] (1996–2005; succeeded by [[John Landers|Dr. John Landers]]).\n\nIn 2005, Bodmer was appointed to lead a £2.3 million project (roughly 4.5 million USD) by the [[Wellcome Trust]] at [[University of Oxford]] to examine the genetic makeup of the [[United Kingdom]] - the [[People of the British Isles]] project. He was joined by Oxford Professor [[Peter Donnelly]] (a population genetics and statistics expert) and the Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow Lon Cardon. Bodmer said ''\"Our aim is to characterise the genetic make-up of the [[United Kingdom|British]] population and relate this to the historical and archaeological evidence.\"'' The researchers presented some of their findings to the public via the [[Channel 4]] television series \"Faces of Britain.\" On 14 April 2007, Channel 4 in [[UK|Britain]] aired a program that highlighted the study’s then-current findings. The project took [[DNA]] samples from hundreds of volunteers throughout Britain, seeking tell-tale fragments of DNA that would reveal the biological traces of successive waves of colonisers — [[Celt]]s, [[Saxons]], [[Vikings]], etc. — in various parts of Britain. The findings showed that the [[Viking]] invasion of Britain was predominantly from Danish Vikings while the [[Orkney Islands]] were settled by Norwegian Vikings.\n\nHe is currently{{when|date=October 2015}} Head of the [[Cancer]] and Immunogenetics [[Laboratory]] in the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the [[University of Oxford]].
