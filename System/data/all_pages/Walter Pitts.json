He is best remembered for having written along with [[Warren McCulloch]], a seminal paper entitled \"A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity\" (1943). This paper proposed the first mathematical model of a [[neural network]]. The unit of this model, a simple formalized neuron, is still the standard of reference in the field of neural networks. It is often called a [[McCulloch–Pitts neuron]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nWalter Pitts was born in [[Detroit]]. [[Michigan]] on April 23, 1923, the son of Walter and Marie (née Welsia). He was an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]] who taught himself [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] and was able to read several languages including [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]].  At the age of 12 he spent three days in a library reading ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' and sent a letter to [[Bertrand Russell]] pointing out what he considered serious problems with the first half of the first volume.  Russell was appreciative and invited him to study in the [[United Kingdom]]. Although this offer was not taken up, Pitts decided to become a logician.\n\n==Academic career==\n\nPitts probably continued to correspond with Bertrand Russell; and at the age of 15  he attended Russell's lectures at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name=\"SMALHEISER2000\"/><ref name=\"ARBIB218\">Cf.

Cowan</ref><ref>Cf. Aizawa 1992</ref>\n\nLater [[Warren McCulloch]] also arrived at the University of Chicago, and in early 1942 invited Pitts, who was still homeless, together with Lettvin to live with his family.  In the evenings McCulloch and Pitts collaborated.  Pitts was familiar with the work of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] on computing and they considered the question of whether the nervous system could be considered a kind of universal computing device as described by Leibniz. This led to their seminal [[neural network]]s paper ''A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity''.\n\nIn 1943 Lettvin introduced Pitts to [[Norbert Wiener]] at [[MIT]], who had recently lost his \"right-hand man\".  Their first meeting, where they discussed Wiener's proof of the [[ergodic theory|ergodic theorem]], went so well that Pitts moved to Boston to work with Wiener. Pitts was a special student of Wiener's at MIT.<ref>Cf.

Lettvin</ref>\n\nFrom 1946, Pitts was a core member and involved with the [[Macy conferences]] whose principal purpose was to set the foundations for a general science of the workings of the human mind.\n\nIn 1951 Wiener convinced [[Jerry Wiesner]] to hire some physiologists of the nervous system.  A group was established with Pitts, Lettvin, McCulloch, and Pat Wall.  Pitts wrote a large thesis on the properties of neural nets connected in three dimensions.  Lettvin described him as \"in no uncertain sense the genius of the group … when you asked him a question, you would get back a whole textbook\".  Pitts was also described as an eccentric, refusing to allow his name to be made publicly available.  He refused all offers of advanced degrees or official positions at MIT as he would have to sign his name.\n\nPitts was a member of the [[Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT]] from 1952 to 1969.\n\n== Emotional trauma and decline ==\n\nWiener suddenly turned against McCulloch, on account of his wife Margaret Wiener, who hated McCulloch, and broke off relations with anyone connected to him, including Pitts. This sent Walter Pitts into a decline into social isolation from which he never recovered. He burned the manuscript on three-dimensional networks and took little further interest in work.  The only exception was a collaboration with [[Robert Gesteland]] which produced a paper on [[olfaction]].  Pitts died in 1969 of bleeding esophageal varices, a condition usually associated with cirrhosis.<ref name=\"SMALHEISER2000\"/><ref name=\"ARBIB218\"/>\n\n==Publications==\n* Walter Pitts, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/xr117416q17648p5/ \"Some observations on the simple neuron circuit\"], ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biology'', Volume 4, Number 3, 121–129, 1942.\n* [[Warren McCulloch]] and Walter Pitts, \"A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity\", 1943, ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics'' 5:115–133.\n: reprint in ''Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research''.
