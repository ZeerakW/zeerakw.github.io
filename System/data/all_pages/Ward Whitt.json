He is the Wai T. Chang Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at [[Columbia University]]. His research focuses on [[queueing theory]], performance analysis, [[Stochastic process|stochastic models]] of telecommunication systems, and [[numerical transform inversion]]. He is recognized for his contributions to the understanding and analyses of complex queues and queuing networks, which led to advances in the telecommunications system.<ref>http://www.nae.edu/MembersSection/Directory20412/30236.aspx</ref> As of November 2, 2015, his publications have been cited over 25,000 times, and he has an h-index of 82.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FWApsI0AAAAJ&hl=en|title = Google Scholar Record for W. Whitt|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nWhitt was born in [[Bozeman, Montana]].  He received a BA in Mathematics from [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] and a PhD in operations research from [[Cornell University|Cornell]] (1969).<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01181.x/full</ref> His doctoral thesis, Weak Convergence Theorems for Queues in Heavy Traffic, paved the path for his future research. Whitt joined the operations research faculty at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] before moving to [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1969. From 1977–2002, he worked in [[Bell Labs]] and then [[AT&T Labs]]. Since then, he has been a professor at Columbia.<ref>http://www.ieor.columbia.edu/fac-bios/whitt/faculty.html</ref>\n\n==Honors==\nWhitt received numerous accolades for his seminal contributions to [[actuarial science]]. He holds a number of telecommunications-related patents.<ref>http://www.columbia.edu/~ww2040/patents.html</ref> He has been on the editorial boards of major management science journals including [[Operations Research (journal)|''Operations Research'']]. He is a member of [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] (INFORMS) and [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]. He has also been a member and committee chair in the [[National Academy of Engineering]]. From 1999 to 2001, Whitt has been on the INFORMS prize committee.<ref>http://www.columbia.edu/~ww2040/activities.html</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n*2003 INFORMS [[Frederick W.
