Leontief won the Nobel Committee's [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1973, and three of his doctoral students have also been awarded the prize ([[Paul Samuelson]] 1970, [[Robert Solow]] 1987, [[Vernon L. Smith]] 2002).\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nWassily Leontief was born on August 5, 1906, in [[Munich]], Germany, the son of Wassily W. Leontief (professor of [[Economics]]) and Slata (later Evgenia, called Genya) Leontief (née Becker).<ref>See [http://www.iioa.org/images/WL-Birth%20Certificate.gif birth data, provided October 4, 2005]. In his [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1973/leontief-bio.html  Nobel Prize website biographical information] Leontiff gives his birth year as 1906 and says he grew up in  [[St. Petersburg]].</ref> W. Leontief, Sr., belonged to a family of [[Old Believers|old-believer]] merchants living in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] since 1741.<ref>Svetlana Kaliadina et al., \"The Family of W.W. Leontief in Russia\", ''Economic Systems Research'', vol.18 (2006), 335-345 (http://econpapers.repec.org/article/tafecsysr/default18.htm).</ref> Genya Becker belonged to a wealthy Jewish family from [[Odessa]]. At 15 in 1921, Wassily, Jr., entered [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Leningrad]] in present day [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. He earned his Learned Economist degree (equivalent to [[Master of Arts]]) in 1924 at the age of 19.\n\n===Opposition in USSR===\nLeontief sided with campaigners for academic autonomy, freedom of speech and in support of [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. As a consequence, he was detained several times by the [[KGB|Cheka]]. In 1925, he was allowed to leave the USSR, mostly because the [[KGB|Cheka]] believed that he was mortally ill  with a [[sarcoma]], a diagnosis that later proved false.<ref>Svetlana Kaliadina et al., \"W.W. Leontief and the Repressions of the 1920s: an Interview\", ''Economic Systems Research'', vol.18 (2006), 347–355 (http://econpapers.repec.org/article/tafecsysr/default18.htm).</ref> He continued his studies at the [[University of Berlin]] and, in 1928 earned a Ph.D. degree in economics under the direction of [[Werner Sombart]], writing his dissertation on ''Circular Flows in Economics''.\n\n===Early professional life===\nFrom 1927 to 1930, he worked at the [[Kiel Institute for the World Economy|Institute for the World Economy]] of the [[University of Kiel]]. There he researched the derivation of statistical demand and supply curves. In 1929, he traveled to China to assist its ministry of railroads as an advisor..\n\nIn 1931, he went to the United States and was employed by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]].\n\nDuring World War II, Leontief served as consultant at the U. S. [[Office of Strategic Services]].\n\n===Affiliation with Harvard===\nLeontief joined [[Harvard University]]'s department of economics in 1932 and in 1946 became [[professor]] of economics there.\n\nIn 1949, Leontief used an early computer at Harvard to model data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to divide the U.S. economy into 500 sectors. Leontief modeled each sector with a linear equation based on the data and used the computer, the [[Harvard Mark II]], to solve the system, one of the first significant uses of computers for mathematical modeling.<ref>Lay, p.1. See also, Leontief, ''Input-Output Economics'' ([[Scientific American]], 1951) reprinted in ''Input-Output Economics'' (1966).</ref>\n\nLeontief set up the Harvard Economic Research Project in 1948 and remained its director until 1973.  Starting in 1965, he chaired the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].\n\n===Affiliation with New York University===\nIn 1975, Leontief joined [[New York University]] and founded and directed the Institute for Economic Analysis.\n\n==Personal==\nIn 1932, Leontief married poet Estelle Marks. Their only child, [[Svetlana Leontief Alpers]], was born in 1936.\n\nAs hobbies Leontief enjoyed [[fly fishing]], [[ballet]], and fine [[wine]]s.  He vacationed for years at his farm in [[West Burke]], Vermont, but after moving to New York in the 1970s moved his summer residence to [[Lakeville, Connecticut]].\n\nLeontief died in New York City on Friday, February 5, 1999 at the age of 93.  His wife died in 2005.\n\n==Major contributions==\n{{BLP sources section|date=December 2010}}\nLeontief is primarily associated with the development of the linear activity model of [[General equilibrium theory|General equilibrium]] and the use of [[input-output analysis]] that results from it{{Citation needed (lead)|date=December 2010}}. He has also made contributions in other areas of economics, such as [[Heckscher-Ohlin model|international trade]] where he documented the [[Leontief paradox]]. He was also one of the first to establish the composite commodity theorem{{Citation needed (lead)|date=December 2010}}.\n\nLeontief earned the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on input-output tables. Input-output tables analyze the process by which inputs from one industry produce outputs for consumption or for inputs for another industry. With the input-output table, one can estimate the change in demand for inputs resulting from a change in production of the final good. The analysis assumes that input proportions are fixed; thus the use of input-output analysis is limited to rough approximations rather than prediction. Input-output was novel and inspired large-scale empirical work; in 2010 its iterative method was recognized as an early intellectual precursor to [[Google]]'s [[PageRank]].<ref>http://science.slashdot.org/story/10/02/17/2317239/PageRank-Type-Algorithm-From-the-1940s-Discovered?art_pos=3</ref><ref>http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/24821/</ref><ref>{{Cite arXiv | eprint=1002.2858 | author1=Massimo Franceschet | title=PageRank: Standing on the shoulders of giants | class=cs.IR | year=2010 }}</ref>\n\nLeontief used input-output analysis to study the characteristics of trade flow between the U.S. and other countries, and found what has been named Leontief's [[paradox]]; \"this country resorts to foreign trade in order to economize its [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and dispose of its [[surplus labor]], rather than vice versa\"{{Cite quote|date=December 2010}}, i.e., U.S. exports were relatively labor-intensive when compared to U.S. imports{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. This is the opposite of what one would expect, considering the fact that the U.S.'s comparative advantage was in capital-intensive goods. According to some economists{{Who|date=December 2010}}, this paradox has since been explained as due to the fact that when a country produces \"more than two goods, the abundance of capital relative to labor does not imply that the capital intensity of its exports should exceed that of imports.\"<ref>http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Leontief.html</ref>\n\nLeontief was also a very strong proponent of the use of quantitative data in the study of economics. Throughout his life Leontief campaigned against \"theoretical assumptions and non-observed facts\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Wassily Leontief (1906-1999) |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Leontief.html |work=Econlib |publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty |date=5 May 2014 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> According to Leontief, too many economists were reluctant to \"get their hands dirty\" by working with raw empirical facts{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. To that end, Wassily Leontief did much to make quantitative data more accessible, and more indispensable, to the study of economics{{According to whom|date=December 2010}}.\n\n==Publications==\n* 1925: “Balans Narodnogo Chozjajstva SSR” in Planovoe Chozjajstvo translated into Italian in Spulber N.(Ed.) as “Il Bilancio dell’economia nazionale dell’URSS.“ in  La Strategia Sovietica per Sviluppo Economico 1924–1930, Giulio Einaudi editore, Torino [discussing the Soviet “Balance of the National Economy”, 1923–4]\n* 1928: ''Die Wirtschaft als Kreislauf'', Tübingen: Mohr: re-published as ''The economy as a circular flow'', pp.&nbsp;181–212 in: Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, Volume 2, Issue 1, June 1991; this translation is abridged to avoid controversial statements.\n* 1941: ''Structure of the American Economy, 1919–1929''\n* 1953: ''Studies in the Structure of the American Economy''\n* 1966: ''Input-Output Economics''\n* 1966: ''Essays in Economics''\n* 1977: ''Essays in Economics, II''\n* 1977: ''The Future of the World Economy''\n* 1983: ''Military Spending: Facts and Figures, Worldwide Implications and Future Outlook'' co-authed with F.

The trouble is caused, however, not by an inadequate selection of targets, but rather by our inability to hit squarely on them, ... by the palpable inadequacy of the scientific means with which  they try to solve them. ... The weak and all too slowly growing empirical foundations clearly cannot support the proliferating superstructure of pure, or should I say, speculative economic theory.... By the time it comes to interpretations of the substantive conclusions, the assumptions on which the model has been based are easily forgotten. But it is precisely the empirical validity of these assumptions on which the usefulness of the entire exercise depends. ...
