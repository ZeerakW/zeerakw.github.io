In 2006, at the 25th [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] he received the [[Fields Medal]] \"for his contributions to the development of stochastic Loewner evolution, the geometry of two-dimensional Brownian motion, and conformal field theory\".  He is professor at [[ETH Zürich]].\n\nWerner became a French national in 1977. After a ''[[preparatory classes|classe préparatoire]]'' at [[Lycée Hoche]] in [[Versailles]], he studied at [[École Normale Supérieure]]  from 1987 to 1991.
