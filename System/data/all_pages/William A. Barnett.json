He is also a Senior Research Fellow of the [http://www.ic2.org/ IC<sup>2</sup> Institute] at the University of Texas at Austin and a Fellow of the [http://krieger.jhu.edu/iae/index.html Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise]. He is the founder and President of the [[Society for Economic Measurement]]. He was previously Research Economist at the Board of Governors of the [[Federal Reserve]] System in [[Washington, D.C.]]; Stuart Centennial Professor of Economics at the [[University of Texas]] at [[Austin]]; and Professor of Economics at [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis]].  Prior to becoming an economist, he worked as an engineer at [[Rocketdyne]] on development of the [[Rocketdyne F-1]] rocket engine.\n\n==Research==\nHis research is in [[macroeconomics]] and [[econometrics]].  He is Founding President of the [[Society for Economic Measurement (SEM)|Society for Economic Measurement]], Founding Editor of the [[Cambridge University Press]] journal, [[Macroeconomic Dynamics]] and of the [[Emerald Group Publishing]] monograph series, ''[http://books.emeraldinsight.com/results.asp?sf1=series&st1=International%20Symposia%20in%20Economic%20Theory%20&%20Econometrics&sort=sort_date/d&CUR=GBP  International Symposia in Economic Theory and Econometrics]'', and originator of the [[Divisia monetary aggregates]] and the \"Barnett critique\".<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/article/3129|title = Empirical Evidence on the Recent Behavior and Usefulness of Simple-Sum and Weighted Measures of the Money Stock|last = Chrystal|first = Alec|date = 1994|journal = Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis Review|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |last2 = MacDonald|first2 = Ronald|pages = 73–109}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nber.org/papers/w17885.pdf|title = The Barnett Critique After Three Decades: A New Keynesian Analysis|last = Belongia|first = Michael|date = 2012|journal = NBER Working Paper|accessdate = 2014|doi = 10.3386/w17885|pmid = |last2 = Ireland|first2 = Peter}}</ref>\n\nIn consumer demand and production modelling, he originated the [[Laurent series]] approach to specification design and the [[seminonparametric]] approach using the [[Müntz–Szász theorem]].  His publications on bifurcation analysis and nonlinear dynamics have shown that robustness of dynamical inferences is compromised, when policy simulations are run only at point estimates of parameters, since confidence regions about those estimates are often crossed by bifurcation boundaries.\n\nHe is a Fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]], a Charter Fellow of the [[Journal of Econometrics]], a Charter Fellow of the [[Society for Economic Measurement (SEM)|Society for Economic Measurement]], a Fellow of the [http://www.thewif.org.uk/ World Innovation Foundation], a Fellow of the [http://www.ic2.org/ IC<sup>2</sup> Institute], and a Fellow of the [http://krieger.jhu.edu/iae/index.html Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise], and Honorary Professor at [[Henan University]] in Kaifeng, China.  He is ranked among the top 2% of the world's economists in [[RePEc]].\n\nHis book with Nobel Laureate, [[Paul A. Samuelson]], ''[http://www.item-book.org/ Inside the Economist's Mind: Conversations with Eminent Economists]'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]] Publishing (2007), ISBN 1-4051-5917-0, has been translated into seven languages.
