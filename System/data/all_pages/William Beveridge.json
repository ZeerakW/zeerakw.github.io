He is best known for his 1942 report ''Social Insurance and Allied Services'' (known as the ''[[Beveridge Report]]'') which served as the basis for the post-[[World War II]] [[welfare state]] put in place by the [[Labour Government 1945–1951|Labour government elected in 1945]].\n\n'''Lord Beveridge''', considered an authority on [[unemployment insurance]] from early in his career, served under [[Winston Churchill]] on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created [[labour exchange]]s and later as Permanent Secretary of the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]]. He was Director of the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of [[University College, Oxford]].\n\nBeveridge published widely on unemployment and [[social security]], his most notable works being: ''Unemployment: A Problem of Industry'' (1909), ''Planning Under Socialism'' (1936), ''[[Full Employment in a Free Society]]'' (1944), ''Pillars of Security'' (1943), ''Power and Influence'' (1953), and ''A Defence of Free Learning'' (1959).\n\n==Early life and education==\nBeveridge, the eldest son of [[Henry Beveridge]], an [[Indian Civil Service]] officer and scholar Annette Akroyd, was born in Rangpur, [[British India|India]] (now [[Rangpur (city), Bangladesh|Rangpur]], [[Bangladesh]]), on 5 March 1879. He was educated at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], a leading [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] near the [[market town]] of [[Godalming]] in Surrey, followed by [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where he studied \nMathematics and Classics, obtaining a First in both. He later studied Law.\n[[File:William Beveridge at Balliol 1898, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Beveridge at Balliol College in 1898]]\n\n==Life and career==\nAfter leaving university, Beveridge initially became a lawyer. He became interested in the [[social services]] and wrote about the subject for the ''[[Morning Post]]'' newspaper. His interest in the causes of unemployment began in 1903 when he worked at [[Toynbee Hall]], a [[settlement house]] in London. There he worked closely with [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] and was influenced by their theories of social reform, becoming active in promoting [[old age pensions]], [[free school meals]], and campaigning for a national system of [[labour exchange]]s.\n\nIn 1908, now considered to be the United Kingdom's leading authority on [[unemployment insurance]], he was introduced by Beatrice Webb to [[Winston Churchill]], who had recently been promoted to the [[First Asquith ministry|Cabinet]] as [[President of the Board of Trade]]. Churchill invited Beveridge to join the Board of Trade, and he organised the implementation of the national system of labour exchanges and [[National Insurance]] to combat unemployment and poverty. During the [[First World War]] he was involved in mobilising and controlling manpower. After the war, he was knighted and made permanent secretary to the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]].\n\nIn 1919 he left the civil service to become director of the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]]. Over the next few years he served on several commissions and committees on [[social policy]]. He was so highly influenced by the [[Fabian Society]] socialists – in particular by [[Beatrice Webb]], with whom he worked on the 1909 ''Poor Laws'' report – that he could readily be considered one of their number. He published academic economic works including his early work on unemployment (1909) and a large historical study of prices and wages (1939). The Fabians made him a director of the LSE in 1919, a post he retained until 1937. During his time as Director, he jousted with [[Edwin Cannan]] and [[Lionel Robbins]], who were trying to steer the LSE away from its Fabian roots.\n\nIn 1933 he helped set up the [[Council for Assisting Refugee Academics|Academic Assistance Council]]. This helped prominent academics who had been dismissed from their posts on grounds of race, religion or political position to escape [[Nazi]] persecution. In 1937, Beveridge was appointed [[Master (college)|Master]] of [[University College, Oxford]].\n\n==Wartime work==\n[[File:Sir W.H. Beveridge, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing left.jpg|thumb|Beveridge in the 1910s.]]\n\nThree years later, [[Ernest Bevin]], Minister of Labour in the wartime National government, invited Beveridge to take charge of the Welfare department of his Ministry. Beveridge refused, but declared an interest in organising British manpower in wartime (Beveridge had come to favour a strong system of centralised planning). Bevin was reluctant to let Beveridge have his way but did commission him to work on a relatively unimportant manpower survey from June 1940 and so Beveridge became a temporary civil servant. Neither Bevin nor the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry [[Thomas Williams Phillips|Sir Thomas Phillips]] liked working with Beveridge as both found him conceited.<ref name=\"Manpower survey\">Paul Addison, ''The Road to 1945'', Jonathan Cape, 1975, p. 117.</ref>\n\n===Report on social insurance===\nAn opportunity for Bevin to ease Beveridge out presented itself in May 1941 when Minister of Health [[Ernest Brown (MP)|Ernest Brown]] announced the formation of a committee of officials to survey existing social insurance and allied services, and to make recommendations. Although Brown had made the announcement, the inquiry had largely been urged by Minister without Portfolio [[Arthur Greenwood]], and Bevin suggested to Greenwood making Beveridge chairman of the committee. Beveridge, at first uninterested and seeing the committee as a distraction from his work on manpower, accepted only reluctantly.<ref name=\"Beveridge committee\">Paul Addison, \"The Road to 1945\", Jonathan Cape, 1975, p. 169.</ref>\n\nThe Report to the Parliament on ''[[Beveridge Report|Social Insurance and Allied Services]]'' was published in 1942. It proposed that all people of working age should pay a weekly [[national insurance]] contribution. In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired or widowed. Beveridge argued that this system would provide a minimum standard of living \"below which no one should be allowed to fall\". It recommended that the government should find ways of fighting the five 'Giant Evils' of Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. Beveridge included as one of three fundamental assumptions the fact that there would be a National Health Service of some sort, a policy already being worked on in the Ministry of Health.<ref name=\"Beveridge report\">Paul Addison, \"The Road to 1945\", Jonathan Cape, 1975, p. 169-170.</ref>\n\nBeveridge's arguments were widely accepted. He appealed to conservatives and other sceptics by arguing that welfare institutions would increase the competitiveness of British industry in the post-war period, not only by shifting labour costs like healthcare and pensions out of [[corporation|corporate]] ledgers and onto the public account but also by producing healthier, wealthier and thus more motivated and productive workers who would also serve as a great source of demand for British goods.\n\nBeveridge saw [[full employment]] (defined as unemployment of no more than 3%) as the pivot of the social welfare programme he expressed in the 1942 report. ''[[Full Employment in a Free Society]]'', written in 1944 expressed how this goal might be gained.<ref>According to Nobel Laureate [[Friedrich Hayek]], this book was ghostwritten by [[Nicholas Kaldor]]. Hayek said that Beveridge \"wasn't the least interested in economics. He knew no economics whatever.\"  Cf. Kresge, Stephan, and Wenar, Leif, ''Hayek on Hayek'', (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1994), p. 86.</ref> Alternative measures for achieving it included [[Keynesian]]-style fiscal regulation, direct control of manpower, and state control of the means of production. The impetus behind Beveridge's thinking was [[social justice]], and the creation of an ideal new society after the war. He believed that the discovery of objective socio-economic laws could solve the problems of society.\n\n==Later career==\n[[File:The Home Front in Britain 1939-1945 TR1625.jpg|thumbnail|right|Beveridge talking to an American fighter pilot hospitalised at [[University College, Oxford]] during the [[Second World War]]]]\nLater in 1944, Beveridge, who had recently joined the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in a [[Berwick-upon-Tweed by-election, 1944|by-election]] to succeed [[George Charles Grey]], who had died on the battlefield in [[Normandy]], France, on the first day of [[Operation Bluecoat]] on 30 July 1944. Beveridge briefly served as [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the constituency of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwick-upon-Tweed]], during which time he was prominent in the [[Radical Action]] group, which called for the party to withdraw from the [[war-time electoral pact]] and adopt more radical policies.  However, he lost his seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], when he was defeated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate, [[Robert Thorp]], by a majority of 1,962 votes.\n\nThe following year the new Labour Government began the process of implementing Beveridge's proposals that provided the basis of the modern Welfare State. [[Clement Attlee]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] defeated [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]]. Attlee announced he would introduce the Welfare State outlined in the 1942 Beveridge Report. This included the establishment of a [[History of the National Health Service (England)|National Health Service in 1948]] with taxpayer funded medical treatment for all. A national system of benefits was also introduced to provide 'social security' so that the population would be protected from the 'cradle to the grave'. The new system was partly built on the [[National Insurance Act 1911|National Insurance scheme]] set up by Lloyd George in 1911.\n\nIn 1946 Beveridge was raised to the peerage as '''Baron Beveridge''', of Tuggal in the County of [[Northumberland]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37627 |date=25 June 1946 |startpage=3229 }}</ref> and eventually became leader of the Liberals in the [[House of Lords]]. He was the author of ''Power and Influence'' (1953).\n\nHe was the President of the charity Attend<ref>[http://www.attend.org.uk/about-us/people-we-honour-0/attend-vips \"Attend VIPs\"]. ''attend.org.uk''. Retrieved on 29 November 2015.</ref> (then the National Association of Leagues of Hospital Friends) from 1952-1962.\n\n==Eugenics==\nBeveridge was a member of the [[Eugenics Society]], which promoted the study of methods to 'improve' the human race by controlling [[human reproduction|reproduction]]. In 1909, he proposed that men who could not work should be supported by the state \"but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen rights – including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood.\"<ref>{{Citation | last = Sewell  | first = Dennis  | author-link =   | last2 =   | first2 =   | author2-link =   | title = How eugenics poisoned the welfare state  | newspaper = The Spectator  | pages =     | date = November 2009  | url = http://www.spectator.co.uk/essays/all/5571423/how-eugenics-poisoned-the-welfare-state.thtml }}</ref> Whilst director of the London School of Economics, Beveridge attempted to create a Department of Social Biology. Though never fully established, [[Lancelot Hogben]], a fierce anti-eugenicist, was named its Chair. Former LSE Director [[John Ashworth (scientist)|John Ashworth]] speculated that discord between those in favour and those against the serious study of eugenics led to Beveridge's departure from the school in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=145449&sectioncode=26 |title=Five years of Darwin seminars: a paradigm shift? &#124; General |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=12 March 1999 |accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1940s, Beveridge credited the Eugenics Society with promoting the [[Child benefit#United Kingdom|children's allowance]], which was incorporated into his 1942 report. However, whilst he held views in support of eugenics, he did not believe the report had any overall \"eugenic value\".<ref>''Eugenics Review'' 1944 April; 36(1): pp17–24.</ref> Professor [[Danny Dorling]] of the [[University of Sheffield]] says \"there is not even the faintest hint\" of eugenic thought in the report.<ref>http://www.rofea.org/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/20/9</ref>\n\nDennis Sewell states that \"On the day the House of Commons met to debate the Beveridge Report in 1943, its author slipped out of the gallery early in the evening to address a meeting of the Eugenics Society at the Mansion House.  ...  His report he was keen to reassure them, was eugenic in intent and would prove so in effect.  ...  The idea of child allowances had been developed within the society with the twin aims of encouraging the educated professional classes to have more children than they currently did and, at the same time, to limit the number of children born to poor households.  For both effects to be properly stimulated, the allowance needed to be graded: middle-class parents receiving more generous payments than working-class parents.  ...  The Home Secretary had that very day signalled that the government planned a flat rate of child allowance. But Beveridge alluding to the problem of an overall declining birth rate, argued that even the flat rate would be eugenic. Nevertheless, he held out hope for the purists. 'Sir William made it clear that it was in his view not only possible but desirable that  graded family allowance schemes, applicable to families in the higher income brackets, be administered concurrently with his flat rate scheme,' reported the Eugenics Review.<ref>''Eugenics Review'' 1943 ; vol.35,: p23.</ref><ref>The Political Gene by Dennis Sewell 2009, chapter 3 page 73-74</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:The graves of Lord and Lady Beveridge, 1992.jpg|thumb|right|The graves of Lord and Lady Beveridge]]\nLord Beveridge married Jessy Janet, daughter of William Philip and widow of David Mair, in 1942.
