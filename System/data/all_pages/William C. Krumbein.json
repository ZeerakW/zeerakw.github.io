This medal was established at the 25th [[International Union of Geological Sciences|International Geological Congress]] in Sydney, in 1976. Krumbein was a founding officer of the IAMG.\n\nKrumbein was born at [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[USA]], in January, 1902, and died on August 18, 1979. At his memorial service, it was said of Krumbein \"that by constitutionally rejecting conventional wisdom, he continually pursued innovative methods, whereby the natural phenomena of geology could be expressed with mathematical rigor.\"\n\nThe legacy left by Krumbein includes his 'Krumbein Scale', a system of measuring '[[roundness (object)|roundness]]' or '[[sphericity]]' of particles and the Krumbein [[Particle size|''phi'']] (φ) scale, a logarithmic scale used for evaluating [[particle size]] that is a modification to the older [[Particle size|Wentworth scale]].\n\n==Awards==\n1977, awarded the [[William H.
