He was effectively adopted by a local squire, Joseph Pryce, when Farr and his family moved to [[Dorrington, Shropshire|Dorrington]]. In 1826 he took a job as a dresser (surgeon's assistant) in [[Shrewsbury, Shropshire|Shrewsbury]] infirmary. Pryce died in November 1828, and left Farr £500 ({{Inflation|UK|500|1828|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}), which allowed him to study medicine in [[France]] and [[Switzerland]]. In Paris he heard [[Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis]] lecture.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ian Hacking|title=The Taming of Chance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ud7EzIBwQBwC&pg=PA84|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=31 August 1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38884-9|page=84}}</ref>\n\nFarr returned to England in 1831 and continued his studies at [[University College London]], qualifying as a licentiate of the [[Society of Apothecaries]] in March 1832. He married in 1833 and started a medical practice in [[Fitzroy Square]], London.  He became involved in medical journalism and statistics.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==General Register Office==\n[[File:William Farr 2.jpg|thumb|William Farr, about 1850]]\nIn 1837 the [[General Register Office for England and Wales|General Register Office]] (GRO) took on the responsibility for the [[United Kingdom Census 1841]].

His most important contribution was to set up a system for routinely recording the causes of death.  For example, for the first time it allowed the [[mortality rate]]s of different occupations to be compared.\n\n==Learned societies and associations==\nIn 1839, Farr joined the [[Royal Statistical Society|Statistical Society]], in which he played an active part as treasurer, vice-president and president over the years.

Early industrialisation had made London the most populous city in the world at the time, and the [[River Thames]] was heavily polluted with untreated sewage. Farr subscribed to the conventional theory that cholera was carried by polluted air rather than water – the  [[miasma theory of disease|miasmic theory]]. On the other hand, as a result of studying this outbreak, the physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] proposed what is now the accepted mechanism for transmission: people were infected by swallowing something and it multiplied in the [[intestine]]s.\n\nThere was another epidemic in 1853, and Farr gathered statistical evidence. John Snow discovered that people supplied with water from two companies in particular: the Southwark & Vauxhall and the Lambeth water companies – which drew their water directly from the Thames were particularly likely to suffer.<ref>Aschengrau, A. & Seage, G. R. (2008). Essentials of epidemiology in public health. Pg:15-21 Sudbury, Mass.: Jones And Bartlett Publishers.</ref> Farr took part in the [[General Board of Health]]'s 1854 Committee for Scientific Enquiries. The conventional explanation for cholera was still [[contingent contagionism|multifactorial]]; Snow's view of cholera as solely caused by a [[pathogen]] was not accepted, though his evidence was taken seriously. Farr's research was detailed and showed an inverse correlation of mortality and elevation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alfredo Morabia|title=A History of Epidemiologic Methods and Concepts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E-OZbEmPSTkC&pg=PA133|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-7643-6818-0|pages=133–4}}</ref>\n\nThere was a further epidemic in 1866, by which time Snow had died, and Farr had accepted Snow's explanation. He produced a monograph which showed that mortality was extremely high for people who drew their water from the Old Ford Reservoir in East London. Farr's work was then considered conclusive.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1858, he performed a study on the correlation of health and marriage condition, and found that health decreases from the married to the unmarried to the widowed.<ref>Tara Parker-Pope (2010-04-14).

He received the Gold Medal of the [[BMA|British Medical Association]] for his work in the field of [[biostatistics]] and was made a [[British honours system|Companion of the Order of Bath]] in 1880.\n\nIn his last years, Farr's approach was obsolescent. [[Bacteriology]] had changed the face of the medical issues, and statistics became an increasingly mathematic tool. Medical reformers, too, changed approach, expecting less from legislation and central government.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lawrence Goldman|title=Science, Reform, and Politics in Victorian Britain|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=io2nB6RcaIwC&pg=PA200|accessdate=23 June 2013|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43301-3|page=200}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nIn 1837 Farr wrote the chapter \"Vital Statistics\" for [[John Ramsey McCulloch]]'s ''Statistical Account of the British Empire''. In January  1837 he established the ''[[British Annals of Medicine, Pharmacy, Vital Statistics, and General Science]]'', discontinued in August of that year. He revised a book of [[James Fernandez Clarke]] on [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Norman L.

In so doing he applied the techniques of [[Benjamin Gompertz]] (the [[Gompertz curve]]), and the closely allied statistical \"law of mortality\" of [[Thomas Rowe Edmonds]]. Farr, by relying on the existing mathematical model of mortality, could use [[data sampling]] to cut back the required computation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alfredo Morabia|title=A History of Epidemiologic Methods and Concepts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E-OZbEmPSTkC&pg=PA155|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-7643-6818-0|page=155}}</ref> From the GRO data he constructed a series of national [[life tables]].<ref name=\"Stone1997\">{{cite book|author=Richard Stone|title=Some British Empiricists in the Social Sciences, 1650-1900|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ccQFbSfF7PIC&pg=PA263|accessdate=21 June 2013|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57145-6|page=263}}</ref>\n\nThe theory of [[zymotic disease]] was Farr's contribution to the debate on [[aetiology]].
