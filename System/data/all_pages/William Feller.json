According to [[Gian-Carlo Rota]], Feller's father's surname was a \"Slavic tongue twister\", which William changed at the age of twenty<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Rota\n | first = Gian-Carlo\n | authorlink = Gian-Carlo Rota\n | year = 1996\n | title = '''Indiscrete Thoughts'''\n | publisher = Birkhäuser\n | isbn = 0-8176-3866-0\n}}</ref>—but as can be seen, this claim was false. His christened name, Vilibald, was chosen by his Catholic mother for the saint day of his birthday.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Feller|title=William Feller}}</ref> In his school documentation, the small municipality of [[Donja Stubica]] in [[Zagorje]] is mentioned. This is the birthplace of his father, who was an [[apothecary]] and owner of a company producing hygienic utensils and [[cosmetics]].\n\nWilliam finished his elementary and middle education in Zagreb, as well as two years of his math study. From 1925, he continued his study in [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]] where he gained the [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] degree in 1926\nunder the supervision of [[Richard Courant]], with his work ''Über algebraisch rektifizierbare transzendente Kurven''.\n\n==Work==\nFeller held a [[docent]] position at the University of [[Kiel]] beginning in 1928. Because he refused to sign a Nazi oath,<ref>{{cite web\n | title=Biography of William Feller\n | work=History of William Feller\n | url=http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/feller.html#scandinavia\n | accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref> he fled the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and went to [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] in 1933. He also lectured in [[Sweden]] ([[Stockholm]] and [[Lund]]).<ref>{{cite book|mr=2522825|last=Siegmund-Schultze|first=Reinhard|title=[[Mathematicians fleeing from Nazi Germany: Individual fates and global impact]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|year=2009|pages=xxviii+471|isbn=978-0-691-14041-4|ref=harv}}</ref> As a refugee in [[Sweden]], Feller reported being troubled by increasing fascism at the universities. He reported that the mathematician [[Torsten Carleman]] would offer his opinion that Jews and foreigners should be [[execution|executed]].<ref>{{harv|Siegmund-Schultze|2009|p=135}}</ref>\n\nFinally, in 1939 he arrived in the [[United States|U.S.]] where he became a [[citizen]] in 1944 and was on the [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] at [[Brown University|Brown]] and [[Cornell University|Cornell]]. In 1950 he became a professor at [[Princeton University]].\n\nThe works of Feller are contained in 104 papers and two books on a variety of topics such as [[mathematical analysis]], theory of [[measurement]], [[functional analysis]], [[geometry]], and [[differential equations]] in addition to his work in [[mathematical statistics]] and probability.\n\nFeller was one of the greatest [[list of probabilists|probabilist]]s of the twentieth century, who is remembered for his championing of [[probability theory]] as a branch of [[mathematical analysis]] in [[Sweden]] and the [[United States]]. In the middle of the 20th century, probability theory was popular in France and Russia, while [[mathematical statistics]] was more popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the Swedish statistician, [[Harald Cramér]].<ref>Preface to his ''Mathematical Methods of Statistics''.</ref> His two-volume textbook on probability theory and its applications was called \"the most successful treatise on probability ever written\" by [[Gian-Carlo Rota]].<ref>Page 199: ''Indiscrete Thoughts''.</ref>  By stimulating his colleagues and students in Sweden and then in the United States, Feller helped establish research groups studying the analytic theory of probability. In his research, Feller contributed to the study of the relationship between [[Markov chain]]s and [[differential equation]]s, where his theory of [[C0-semigroup#Infinitesimal generator|generator]]s of [[one-parameter semigroup]]s of [[stochastic process]]es gave rise to the theory of \"Feller operators\".\n\n==Results==\nNumerous topics relating to probability are named after him, including  [[Feller process]]es, [[Feller's explosion test]], [[Feller–Brown movement]],  and the [[central limit theorem|Lindeberg–Feller theorem]]. Feller made fundamental contributions to [[renewal theory]], [[Tauberian theorems]], [[random walks]], [[diffusion processes]], and the [[law of the iterated logarithm]]. Feller was among those early editors who launched the journal ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]''.\n\n==Notable books==\n* ''An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications, Volume I, 3rd edition'' (1968); 1st edn.
