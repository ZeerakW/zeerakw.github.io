He was also a [[statistician]] and an [[educator]].  Ogburn received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree from [[Mercer University]] and his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degrees from [[Columbia University]].<ref>http://www2.asanet.org/governance/ogburn.html</ref>  He was a professor of sociology at Columbia from 1919 until 1927, when he became chair of the Sociology Department at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nHe served as the president of [[American Sociological Society]] in 1929. He was the [[editor in chief|editor]] of the [[Journal of the American Statistical Association]] from 1920 to 1926. In 1931, he was elected as the president of [[American Statistical Association]]. He was also known for his idea of \"[[Cultural lag|culture lag]]\" in society's adjustment to technological and other changes. He played a pivotal role in producing the groundbreaking Recent Social Trends during his research directorship of President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s Committee on Social Trends from 1930 to 1933.\n\nHe was one of the most prolific sociologists of his time, with 175 articles under his name.\n\n== Social Change ==\n\nPerhaps Ogburn's most enduring intellectual legacy is the theory of social change he offered in 1922.<ref>Ogburn, William Fielding. 1922. ''Social Change with Respect to Culture and Original Nature.'' New York: B.W. Huebsch.</ref> He suggested that technology is the primary engine of progress, but tempered by social responses to it. Thus, his theory is often considered a case of [[Technological determinism]], but is really more than that. Ogburn posited four stages of technical development: invention, accumulation, diffusion and adjustment.\n\n''Invention'' is the process by which new forms of technology are created. Inventions are collective contributions to an existing cultural base that cannot occur unless the society has already gained a certain level of knowledge and expertise in the particular area. ''Accumulation'' is the growth of technology because new things are invented more rapidly than old ones are forgotten, and some inventions (such as writing) promote this accumulation process. ''Diffusion'' is the spread of an idea from one cultural group to another, or from one field of activity to another, and as diffusion brings inventions together, they combine to form new inventions. ''Adjustment'' is the process by which the non-technical aspects of a culture respond to invention, and any retardation of this adjustment process causes [[cultural lag]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://asanet.org/page.ww?name=William+F.+Ogburn&section=Presidents American Sociological Association]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              = Ogburn, William Fielding\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American sociologist\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = June 29, 1886\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    =\n| DATE OF DEATH     = April 27, 1959\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ogburn, William Fielding}}\n[[Category:1886 births]]\n[[Category:1959 deaths]]\n[[Category:American sociologists]]\n[[Category:Men sociologists]]\n[[Category:Columbia University faculty]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the American Sociological Association]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association]]\n[[Category:American statisticians]]\n[[Category:People from Butler, Georgia]]\n\n\n{{US-sociologist-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "William Fielding Ogburn"}}}}
