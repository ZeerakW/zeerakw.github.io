He has also worked in the field of [[Bayesian statistics]], particularly with astronomical applications.  He was the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] Astrometry Science Team leader, and participated in the project that repaired the Hubble Space Telescope after the discovery of its initial [[optic]]al defect.\n\nJefferys served as chairman of The University of Texas Department of Astronomy from 1994 to 1998. He retired from the University of Texas in 2004 and moved to Vermont in 2005, where he accepted an appointment as adjunct professor of statistics at the University of Vermont.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/ Bill Jefferys homepage]\n*[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?sim_query=YES&ned_query=YES&aut_xct=NO&aut_logic=OR&obj_logic=OR&author=Jefferys%2C+W&object=&start_mon=&start_year=1962&end_mon=&end_year=&ttl_logic=OR&title=&txt_logic=OR&text=&nr_to_return=150&start_nr=1&query_type=PAPERS&select_nr=50&select_start=1&start_entry_day=&start_entry_mon=&start_entry_year=&min_score=&jou_pick=ALL&ref_stems=&data_and=ALL&group_and=ALL&sort=SCORE&aut_wt=1.0&obj_wt=1.0&ttl_wt=0.3&txt_wt=3.0&ttl_syn=YES&txt_syn=YES&aut_wgt=YES&obj_wgt=YES&ttl_wgt=YES&txt_wgt=YES&ttl_sco=YES&txt_sco=YES&db_key=AST&version=1 Jefferys' publications] (a partial list from [[NASA]] [[Astrophysics Data System]]).
