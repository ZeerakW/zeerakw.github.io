He commanded a regiment at the battles of Kirkee and Poonah and was involved in the capture of hill forts. By 1810 he could speak Hindi and Marathi languages. He became a captain on 25 January 1819 and travelled for four years across Europe from 1820. He returned to India in October 1824 and was appointed by Monstuart Elphinstone as a statistical reporter to the Bombay government. He then collected statistical and natural history researches, and completed a census of the population of the Deccan producing two voluminous statistical reports, and a complete natural history report illustrated with drawings. He married Elizabeth, daughter of William Hay of Renistoun in 1824. He was promoted to the rank of a Major on 8 September 1826 and to Lieutenant-Colonel on 9 April 1831. In December 1829 the post of statistical reporter was abolished but he took leave from military duty and continued to work on his statistical surveys. He completed this in January 1831 and left for Europe on furlough. He retired from active service with the rank of colonel on 18 June 1833 and in September 1835 he became a Royal [[Commissioners in Lunacy|Commissioner in Lunacy]], a post he held till 1845.

Some of statistical research contributions included the computations of the cost of maintenance per soldier.

In 1856 the citizens of Bombay presented Sykes with a medal for his advocacy in favour of a native system of education. He wrote extensively on Buddhism and its antiquity and believed that it was the original religion followed in India.
