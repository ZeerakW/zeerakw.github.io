He is best known for having formulated the [[Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance]] (together with [[W. Allen Wallis]]), a widely used [[non-parametric statistics|nonparametric statistical method]].\n\n==Biography==\nKruskal was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref>[http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/1972_24_01_00_brown.pdf American Jewish Archives: \"Two Baltic Families Who Came to America The Jacobsons and the Kruskals, 1870-1970\" by RICHARD D.

O'Connor and E.F. Robertson] November 2006</ref>  His mother, [[Lillian Rose Vorhaus Kruskal Oppenheimer]], became a noted promoter of [[Origami]] during the early era of television.  He was the oldest of five children, three of whom, including himself, became researchers in mathematics and physics; see [[Joseph Kruskal]] and [[Martin Kruskal]].  Kruskal left [[Antioch College]] to attend [[Harvard University]], receiving bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics in 1940 and 1941.  He pursued a Ph. D. in [[Mathematical Sciences]] at [[Columbia University]], graduating in 1955. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Kruskal served at the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division|U.S. Naval Proving Ground]] in [[Dahlgren, Virginia]].  After brief stints working for his father and lecturing at Columbia, he joined the [[University of Chicago]] faculty as an instructor in statistics in 1950.  He edited the [[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]] from 1958 to 1961, served as president of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]] in 1971, and of the [[American Statistical Association]] in 1982.  Kruskal retired as Professor Emeritus in 1990. He died in [[Chicago]].\n\n==Notable works==\n* {{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2280779 |author1=Kruskal, William H |author2=Allen Wallis, W |title=Use of ranks in one-criterion analysis of variance |jstor=2280779  |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume= 47 |issue=260 |year=1952 |pages= 583–621 }}\n* {{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2281536 |author1=Goodman, Leo A |authorlink1=Leo Goodman|author2=Kruskal, William H |title=Measures of association for cross classifications |jstor=2281536 |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume= 49 |issue=268 |year=1954 |pages= 732–764 }}\n* {{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2282143 |author1=Goodman, Leo A |author2=Kruskal, William H |title=Measures of Association for Cross Classifications.
