His brother was [[George Cadogan Morgan]]. At eighteen he came to London for medical training at [[Guy's Hospital]], working also as an [[apothecary]] to pay his way. He did not complete his training, but after one year returned to Bridgend to join his father's practice. He was not popular with his father's patients: they thought him inexperienced and they resented receiving treatment from someone with a deformity—Morgan suffered from a club foot. \nAfter his father's death he left medicine and, on the recommendation of his mother's brother, [[Richard Price]],  in 1774 was appointed Assistant [[Actuary]] of [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society]].\n{{sfn|Thomas|1894}} \nIn February 1775, after the death of John Pocock, he was elected Actuary. By the time he retired on 2 December 1830, 56 years later at the age of 80, he laid the foundations of [[actuary|the actuarial profession]]&nbsp;—in fact the term \"actuarial\" became attached to the profession because of his title.\n\nHe won the [[Copley Medal]] in 1789, for his two papers on the values of Reversions and Survivorships,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/General_WF.aspx?pageid=7035&terms=william+morgan&fragment=&SearchType=&terms=william%20morgan|title=Copley Medal  — 1799 - 1731|publisher=[[The Royal Society]]|accessdate=12 July 2010|location=London}}</ref> printed in the last two volumes of the [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]], in the field of [[actuarial science]]:\n* ''On the Probabilities of Survivorships Between Two Persons of Any Given Ages, and the Method of Determining the Values of Reversions Depending on those Survivorships'', 1788–1794\n* ''On  the Method of Determining, from the Real Probabilities of Life, the Value of a Contingent Reversion in Which Three Lives are Involved in the Survivorship''.
