Having served as a clerk under a stamp distributor, he passed to the [[Yorkshire Fire and Life Office]] at York, then to the banking house of [[Messrs. Leatham, Few, and Co.]], at [[Wakefield]] (1843–1846).

He was also elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]].\n\nHis extensive knowledge of banking was displayed in the evidence which he gave before the select committee on the Bank Acts in 1857. He collaborated with [[Thomas Tooke]] in the two final volumes of his ''History of Prices'' and was responsible for the greater part of the work in those volumes. For nineteen years he wrote a survey of the commercial history of the year in [[The Economist]]. He died at [[Torquay]] on 23 March 1882 and was buried at [[West Norwood Cemetery]].\n\nAfter his death his friends founded, in perpetuation of his memory, a [[Newmarch Lectureship]] in economic science and statistics at University College, London.
