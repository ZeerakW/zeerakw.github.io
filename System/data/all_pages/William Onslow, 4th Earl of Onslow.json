He held several governmental positions between 1880 and 1905 and was also [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor of New Zealand]] between 1889 and 1892.\n\n==Background and education==\nBorn at [[Old Alresford]], [[Hampshire]], Onslow was the only son of George Augustus Cranley Onslow, son of the Hon. Thomas Cranley Onslow, second son of [[Thomas Onslow, 2nd Earl of Onslow]]. His mother was Mary Harriet Anne Loftus. In 1870, at the age of 17, he succeeded his [[Arthur Onslow, 3rd Earl of Onslow|great-uncle]] in the earldom of Onslow. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Exeter College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\">[http://www.thepeerage.com/p2646.htm thepeerage.com William Hillier Onslow, 4th Earl of Onslow]</ref>\n\n==Political career, 1880-1889==\nOnslow briefly served as a [[Lord-in-Waiting]] (government whip in the House of Lords) under the [[Benjamin Disraeli|Earl of Beaconsfield]] between February and April 1880 and held the same position under [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] between 1886 and 1887, and later served under Salisbury as [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]] between 1887 and 1888 (in which post he was vice president of the first Colonial Conference in April 1887) and as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade]] between 1888 and 1889.<ref name=\"DNZB\">{{DNZB|Galbreath|Ross|2o6|Onslow, William Hillier 1853â€“1911|7 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Governor of New Zealand, 1889-1892==\nIn November 1888 Onslow was appointed [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor of New Zealand]],.<ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=25878 |date=27 November 1888 |startpage=6740 }}</ref> As a result of the economic downturn in the late 1880s, he had sought a salaried position as a colonial governor. At 35, he was the youngest governor of New Zealand since [[George Grey]] was appointed in 1845 and the first since [[Robert FitzRoy]] in 1843 to have no previous experience in a vice-regal position. The New Zealand government had recently cut allowances for the governor, and Onslow was able to obtain the position mainly as it was no longer attractive to more senior colonial administrators.<ref name=\"DNZB\"/>\n\nHe assumed the office on 2 May 1889. Shortly after his arrival in [[Wellington]], there was an outbreak of [[typhoid fever]] in the town. Onslow's twelve-year-old son and heir, [[Richard Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow|Viscount Cranley]], caught the disease and was at one time seen to be in danger of his life. After this Onslow and his family avoided the capital as much as they could - which did not endear them to the New Zealand people. According to the ''[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]'', Onslow did not \"have the flair or flamboyance which helped some later governors win popular support\".<ref name=\"DNZB\"/>\n\nIn 1890 Onslow became embroiled in controversy over appointments to the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] (the upper house of the New Zealand parliament), which were made by the governor on the advice of his ministers. Up until then [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Harry Atkinson]] had not made any recommendations on appointements. However, this year Atkinson's conservative supporters became more and more concerned that the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberals]] under [[John Ballance]] would gain power. Atkinson was put under pressure to assure that there was a conservative majority in the Council. Onslow, as a Conservative, is considered to have been sympathetic to the idea, especially as he was used to the system in Britain, where it was acceptable practice for an outgoing British government to nominate new members of the [[House of Lords]]. He informed Atkinson that a \"little list\" of nominations for the Legislative Council could be agreed upon and used \"if things go wrong with you in the House or Country\".<ref name=\"DNZB\"/>\n\nAtkinson lost ground in the election of December 1890, although it was unclear if the Liberals under Ballance would get enough support to form an administration. Rumours of the \"little list\" began to spread and Onslow was made aware that, even if it was common practice for an outgoing government in Britain to nominate members for the House of Lords, this was not the case in New Zealand. However, despite public opposition Onslow followed Atkinson's recommendations and nominated six people to the council (although the number was reduced from eleven). He justified his decision to the Colonial Office in [[London]] on the basis that he could find no Royal instruction or colonial precedent for refusing Atkinson's nomination and referred to \"the constant practice in England\". Onslow's actions even further damaged the reputation of the council. Several independent members were pressurised into supporting Ballance, who was able to form an administration.<ref name=\"DNZB\"/>\n\nIn 1891 Ballance asked Onslow to nominate 18 representatives to the council in order to counterbalance Atkinson's nominations of the previous year. Onslow said he was unwilling to alter the composition of the council and replace the conservative majority with a liberal one, stating that in his view an upper house of parliament should always be conservative in its nature. He agreed to nominate eight representatives, a compromise Ballance declined. The matter was finally deferred to Onslow's successor, the [[David Boyle, 7th Earl of Glasgow|Earl of Glasgow]]. Onslow resigned in February 1892 and returned to [[England]].<ref name=\"DNZB\"/>\n\n==Political career, 1892-1911==\nWhen the Conservatives returned to power in 1895 under Lord Salisbury, Onslow was made [[Under-Secretary of State for India]], a post he retained until 1900, and was then once again Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies between 1900 and 1903 (from 1902 to 1903 under the premiership of [[Arthur Balfour]]).<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/> In 1903 he entered Balfour's cabinet as [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food|President of the Board of Agriculture]] and was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] the same year.<ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=27555 |date=22 May 1903 |startpage=3239 }}</ref> He remained at the Board of Agriculture until the government fell in 1905. From 1905 to 1911 he was Lord Chairman of Committees of the [[House of Lords]]. He was also [[President of the Royal Statistical Society]] from 1905 to 1906.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rss.org.uk/main.asp?page=1078|title = Royal Statistical Society Presidents|publisher= Royal Statistical Society|accessdate = 6 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:The_Earl_of_Onslow.jpg|thumb|110px|right|The arms of the Earl of Onslow.
