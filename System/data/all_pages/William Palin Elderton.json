Elderton also had a very long association with the statistical journal [[Biometrika]]. In its early days he published several articles, and in 1935 he became chairman of the Biometrika Trust.\n\nIn 1900 when he was training to be an actuary Elderton met [[Karl Pearson]] and was drawn into the [[University College London|University College]] statistical group. In 1902 Elderton computed the first tables of Pearson's [[Chi-squared distribution|chi-squared]] and in 1907 he published an exposition of the [[Pearson distribution|Pearson curves]] for actuaries. His sister [[Ethel M. Elderton]] worked for Pearson, and together the Eldertons wrote an introduction to the new ideas in [[statistics]]. She  provided financial backing for Pearson's [[Anthropometric Laboratory]], \"his fourth laboratory\".\n\nElderton was an invited speaker in the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] 1908, [[Rome]] on the topic of \"''Various Applications of Mathematics''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=ICM Plenary and Invited Speakers since 1897|url=http://www.mathunion.org/db/ICM/Speakers/SortedByCongress.php|publisher=[[International Congress of Mathematicians]]}}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n\n* W.
