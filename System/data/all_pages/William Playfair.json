FitzPatrick (1960). \"Leading British Statisticians of the Nineteenth Century\". In: ''Journal of the American Statistical Association'', Vol. 55, No. 289 (Mar. 1960), pp. 38–70.</ref>\n\nWilliam Playfair invented three types of [[Information graphics|diagrams]]: in 1786 the [[line chart|line graph]] and [[bar chart]] of economic data, and in 1801 the [[pie chart]] and circle graph, used to show part-whole relations.<ref>[[Michael Friendly]] (2008).

Retrieved 7 July 2008.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nPlayfair was born in 1759 in Scotland during [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]], a Golden Age in the arts, sciences, industry and commerce. He was the fourth son of the [[reverend]] James Playfair of the parish of Liff & Benvie near the city of [[Dundee]] in Scotland; his notable brothers were architect [[James Playfair]] and mathematician [[John Playfair]]. His father died in 1772 when William was 13, leaving the eldest brother John to care for the family and his education. After his [[apprenticeship]] with [[Andrew Meikle]], the inventor of the threshing machine, Playfair became draftsman and personal assistant to [[James Watt]] at the [[Boulton and Watt]] steam engine manufactory in [[Soho, West Midlands|Soho, Birmingham]].<ref name=\"SW 1997\">[[Ian Spence (psychologist)|Ian Spence]] and [[Howard Wainer]] (1997). \"[http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/spence/Spence_Wainer_1997b.pdf Who Was Playfair?]\". In: ''Chance'' 10, p. 35–37.</ref>\n\nPlayfair had a variety of careers. He was in turn a millwright, engineer, draftsman, accountant, inventor, silversmith, merchant, investment broker, economist, statistician, pamphleteer, translator, publicist, land speculator, convict, banker, ardent royalist, editor, blackmailer and journalist. On leaving Watt's company in 1782, he set up a silversmithing business and shop in London, which failed. In 1787 he moved to Paris, taking part in the [[storming of the Bastille]] two years later. He returned to London in 1793, where he opened a \"security bank\", which also failed. From 1775 he worked as a writer and pamphleteer and did some engineering work.<ref name=\"SW 1997\"/>\n\n==Work==\n[[Ian Spence (psychologist)|Ian Spence]] and [[Howard Wainer]] in 2001 describe Playfair as \"engineer, political economist and scoundrel\" while \"Eminent Scotsmen\" calls him an \"ingenious mechanic and miscellaneous writer.\" It compares his career with the glorious one of his older brother [[John Playfair]], the distinguished Edinburgh professor, and draws a moral about the importance of \"steadiness and consistency of plan\" as well as of \"genius.\"<ref>[[Ian Spence (psychologist)|Ian Spence]] and [[Howard Wainer]] (2001). \"William Playfair\". In: ''Statisticians of the Centuries''. C.C. Heyde and E. Seneta (eds.)  New York: Springer. pp. 105–110.</ref>\n\n===Bar chart===\nTwo decades before Playfair's first achievements, in 1765 [[Joseph Priestley]] had created the innovation of the first timeline charts, in which individual bars were used to visualise the life span of a person, and the whole can be used to compare the life spans of multiple persons. According to [[James R. Beniger]] and Robyn (1978) \"Priestley's timelines proved a commercial success and a popular sensation, and went through dozens of editions\".<ref name=\"JRB78\">[[James R. Beniger]] and Dorothy L. Robyn (1978). \"Quantitative graphics in statistics: A brief history\". In: ''The American Statistician''. 32: pp. 1–11.</ref>\n\n[[Image:PriestleyChart.gif|center|500px]]\n\nThese timelines directly inspired Wiliam Playfair's invention of the [[bar chart]], which first appeared in his ''Commercial and Political Atlas'', published in 1786. According to Beniger and Robyn (1978) \"Playfair was driven to this invention by a lack of data. In his Atlas he had collected a series of 34 plates about the import and export from different countries over the years, which he presented as [[line graph]]s or surface charts: line graphs shaded or tinted between abscissa and function. Because Playfair lacked the necessary series data for Scotland, he graphed its trade data for a single year as a series of 34 bars, one for each of 17 trading partners\".<ref name=\"JRB78\"/>\n\n[[File:1786 Playfair - Exports and Imports of Scotland to and from different parts for one Year from Christmas 1780 to Christmas 1781.jpg|center|500px]]\n\nIn this bar chart Scotland's imports and exports from and to 17 countries in 1781 are represented. \"This bar chart was the first quantitative graphical form that did not locate data either in space, as had coordinates and tables, or time, as had Priestley's timelines. It constitutes a pure solution to the problem of discrete quantitative comparison\".<ref name=\"JRB78\"/>\n\n===Graphics===\n[[Image:Playfair-piechart.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Pie chart]] from Playfair's ''Statistical Breviary'' (1801), showing the proportions of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish Empire]] located in Asia, Europe and Africa before 1789]]\n\nPlayfair, who argued that charts communicated better than tables of data, has been credited with inventing the [[line chart|line]], [[bar chart|bar]], and [[pie chart]]s.  His time-series plots are still presented as models of clarity.\n\nPlayfair first published ''The Commercial and Political Atlas'' in London in 1786.  It contained 43 time-series plots and one bar chart, a form apparently introduced in this work.  It has been described as the first major work to contain statistical graphs.\n\nPlayfair's ''[[Statistical Breviary]],'' published in London in 1801, contains what is generally credited as the first [[pie chart]].<ref>[[Edward R.
