He was a pioneer in the field of [[low-dimensional topology]]. In 1982, he was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] for his contributions to the study of [[3-manifold]]s. From 2003 until his death he was a professor of mathematics and [[computer science]] at [[Cornell University]].\n\n==Mathematical contributions==\n\n===Foliations===\nHis early work, in the early 1970s, was mainly in [[foliation]] theory, where he had a dramatic impact. His more significant results include:\n\n* The proof that every [[Haefliger structure]] on a manifold can be integrated to a foliation (this implies, in particular that every manifold with zero [[Euler characteristic]] admits a foliation of codimension one).\n\n* The construction of a continuous family of smooth, codimension one foliations on the [[n-sphere|three-sphere]] whose [[Godbillon–Vey invariant]] (after Claude Godbillon and Jacques Vey) takes every real value.\n\n* With [[John Mather (mathematician)|John Mather]], he gave a proof that the [[cohomology]] of the group of [[homeomorphism]]s of a manifold is the same whether the group is considered with its discrete topology or its [[compact-open topology]].\n\nIn fact, Thurston resolved so many outstanding problems in foliation theory in such a short period of time that it led to a kind of exodus from the field, where advisors counselled students against going into foliation theory<ref>http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-mathematical-legacy-of-william-thurston-1946-2012/</ref> because Thurston was \"cleaning out the subject\" (see \"On Proof and Progress in Mathematics\", especially section 6<ref name=bams>{{cite journal | last = Thurston  | first = William P.  |date=April 1994  | title = On Proof and Progress in Mathematics | journal = [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]  | volume = 30  | issue = 2  | pages = pages 161–177  | arxiv = math/9404236  | doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-1994-00502-6 }}</ref> ).\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n===The geometrization conjecture===\nHis later work, starting around the mid-1970s, revealed that [[hyperbolic geometry]] played a far more important role in the general theory of [[3-manifolds]] than was previously realised.  Prior to Thurston, there were only a handful of known examples of [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s of finite volume, such as the [[Seifert–Weber space]].  The independent and distinct approaches of Robert Riley and Troels Jørgensen in the mid-to-late 1970s showed that such examples were less atypical than previously believed; in particular their work showed that the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] complement was [[hyperbolic link|hyperbolic]].  This was the first example of a hyperbolic knot.\n\nInspired by their work, Thurston took a different, more explicit means of exhibiting the hyperbolic structure of the figure eight knot complement.  He showed that the figure eight knot complement could be decomposed as the union of two regular ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra whose hyperbolic structures matched up correctly and gave the hyperbolic structure on the figure eight knot complement.  By utilizing [[Wolfgang Haken|Haken]]'s [[normal surface]] techniques, he classified the [[incompressible surface]]s in the knot complement.  Together with his analysis of deformations of hyperbolic structures, he concluded that all but 10 [[Dehn surgery|Dehn surgeries]] on the figure eight knot resulted in [[irreducible (3-manifold)|irreducible]], non-[[Haken manifold|Haken]] non-[[Seifert fiber space|Seifert-fibered]] 3-manifolds.  These were the first such examples; previously it had been believed that except for certain Seifert fiber spaces, all irreducible 3-manifolds were Haken.  These examples were actually hyperbolic and motivated his next revolutionary theorem.\n\nThurston proved that in fact most Dehn fillings on a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold resulted  in hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  This is his celebrated [[hyperbolic Dehn surgery]] theorem.\n\nTo complete the picture, Thurston proved a [[hyperbolization theorem]] for [[Haken manifold]]s.  A particularly important corollary is that many knots and links are in fact hyperbolic.  Together with his hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem, this showed that closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds existed in great abundance.\n\nThe geometrization theorem has been called ''Thurston's Monster Theorem,'' due to the length and difficulty of the proof.  Complete proofs were not written up until almost 20 years later.  The proof involves a number of deep and original insights which have linked many apparently disparate fields to [[3-manifold]]s.\n\nThurston was next led to formulate his [[geometrization conjecture]].  This gave a conjectural picture of 3-manifolds which indicated that all 3-manifolds admitted a certain kind of geometric decomposition involving eight geometries, now called Thurston model geometries.  Hyperbolic geometry is the most prevalent geometry in this picture and also the most complicated. The conjecture was proved by [[Grigori Perelman]] in 2002–2003.\n\n===Orbifold theorem===\nIn his work on hyperbolic Dehn surgery, Thurston realized that [[orbifold]] structures naturally arose.  Such structures had been studied prior to Thurston, but his work, particularly the next theorem, would bring them to prominence.  In 1981, he announced the [[Orbifold#3-dimensional orbifolds|orbifold theorem]], an extension of his geometrization theorem to the setting of 3-orbifolds.  Two teams of mathematicians around 2000 finally finished their efforts to write down a complete proof, based mostly on Thurston's lectures given in the early 1980s in Princeton.  His original proof relied partly on [[Richard Hamilton (professor)|Hamilton]]'s work on the [[Ricci flow]].\n\n==Education and career==\nThurston was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] to a homemaker and an aeronautical engineer. He received his bachelor's degree from New College (now [[New College of Florida]]) in 1967.<ref>http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2012/08/mathematics-innovator-william-thurston-dies-65</ref> For his undergraduate thesis he developed an [[intuitionism|intuitionist]] foundation for topology. Following this, he earned a doctorate in mathematics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1972. His Ph.D. advisor was [[Morris W. Hirsch]] and his dissertation was on ''Foliations of Three-Manifolds which are Circle Bundles''.<ref>http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=11749</ref>\n\nAfter completing his Ph.D., he spent a year at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/ |title=Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars |publisher=Ias.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}</ref> then another year at [[MIT]] as Assistant Professor.  In 1974, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at [[Princeton University]]. He and his first wife, née Rachel Findley, had three children: Dylan, Nathaniel, and Emily.<ref name=NYT/>  In 1991, he returned to UC-Berkeley as Professor of Mathematics and in 1993 became Director of the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]]. In 1996, his wife Julian, who had earlier been his Ph.D. student at Princeton University, made a career switch to veterinary medicine, and began her studies at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.  Bill and Julian moved to Davis, California, where Bill  became Professor of Mathematics at UC Davis.  In 2000, their first child Jade was born, and in 2003 their second child Liam was born. Bill and Julian had visited Ithaca in 1997 for a family celebration for his mother's 80th birthday.  They were enchanted by the beauty of Ithaca, and in 2003 the family moved to Ithaca, NY, where Bill  became  Professor of Mathematics at [[Cornell University]].\n\nHis Ph.D. students include [[Martin Bridgeman]], [[Danny Calegari]], [[Richard Canary]], Suhyoung Choi, Renaud Dreyer, Julian Thurston (aka Karen Barris), [[David Gabai]], [[William Goldman (professor)|William Goldman]], [[Benson Farb]], Sergio Fenley, [[Detlef Hardorp]], [[Craig Hodgson]], Christopher Jerdonek, [[Richard Kenyon]], [[Steven Kerckhoff]], [[Silvio Levy]], [[Robert Meyerhoff]], [[Yair Minsky]], [[Lee Mosher]], [[Igor Rivin]], Nicolau Saldanha, [[Oded Schramm]], [[Richard Schwartz]], [[William Floyd (mathematician)|William Floyd]], Biao Wang and [[Jeffrey Weeks (mathematician)|Jeffrey Weeks]].<ref>http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=11749</ref> His son [[Dylan Thurston]] is an associate professor of mathematics at [[Indiana University]].\n\nIn later years Thurston widened his attention to include mathematical education and bringing mathematics to the general public.  He has served as mathematics editor for [[Quantum Magazine]], a youth science magazine, and was one of the founders of  [[The Geometry Center]].  As director of [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] from 1992 to 1997, he initiated a number of programs designed to increase awareness of mathematics among the public.\n\nIn 2005 Thurston won the first AMS Book Prize, for ''Three-dimensional Geometry and Topology''.\nThe prize \"recognizes an outstanding research book that makes a seminal contribution to the research literature\".<ref name=amsbookprize>{{cite web | title=William P. Thurston Receives 2005 AMS Book Prize|url=http://www.ams.org/ams/press/book-thurston.html| accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Thurston was awarded the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] by the [[American Mathematical Society|AMS]] for seminal contribution to research. The citation described his work as having \"revolutionized 3-manifold theory\".<ref name=prizebooklet>{{cite web | title=AMS prize booklet 2012|url=http://www.ams.org/profession/prizebooklet-2012.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHe died on August 21, 2012 in [[Rochester, New York]], of a sinus mucosal [[melanoma]] that was diagnosed in 2011.<ref name=cornell-obit>\"[http://www.math.cornell.edu/News/2012-2013/thurston.html Department mourns loss of friend and colleague, Bill Thurston]\", Cornell University</ref><ref>[http://www.ams.org/news?news_id=1602 Obituary] from [[American Mathematical Society]]</ref><ref name=NYT>{{cite news\n| newspaper = [[New York Times]]\n| url       = http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/us/william-p-thurston-theoretical-mathematician-dies-at-65.html\n| page      = B15\n| date      = August 23, 2012 <!-- date and page are for print edition, online article date is August 22 -->\n| title     = William P.

Thurston died before he could make the move to California.  He had remained with his brother  George in Rochester, NY, while his family went ahead of him to California to get settled, waiting for him to  gain better physical strength for making the cross-country trip to California to join them.  Bill's health declined rapidly, and the family returned to Rochester to be with him during his final days.\n\nIn Thurston's last days, he sometimes used American Sign Language to communicate with his children, Liam and Jade. Bill and Julian had spent a year studying ASL when Jade was an infant, and the family had become somewhat fluent. He also communicated by writing on one of his many pads of paper. One of his last written messages was, \"Treasure Island,\" and this reference remains mysterious to his family.\n\n===Selected works===\n*William Thurston, ''[[The geometry and topology of three-manifolds]]'', Princeton lecture notes (1978–1981).\n*William Thurston, ''Three-dimensional geometry and topology.
