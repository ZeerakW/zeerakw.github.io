He was the second son, among his fathers three sons. He started his education in 1854 at the 'Quaker Seminary' at Queenswood, [[Hampshire]], after a year he joined, the [[Glasgow Academy]].\n\nHe was educated at [[Glasgow University]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] 1860), [[Paris]] and [[Bonn]], acquiring a knowledge of [[Sanskrit]], [[LL.D.]], before passing first in the final examination for the [[Indian Civil Service]] in 1862.\n\n==Career==\nHe reached [[Bengal Presidency]] in November 1862 and was appointed assistant magistrate and collector of [[Birbhum]], in the lower provinces of [[Bengal]], where he began collecting local traditions and records, which formed the materials for his publication, entitled ''The Annals of Rural Bengal'', which influenced among others the [[historical romance]] ''[[Durgeshnandini]]'' of [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]].<ref name=\"ChakravortyGupta2004\" />\n\nHe also compiled ''A Comparative Dictionary of the Non-Aryan Languages of India'', a glossary of dialects based mainly upon the collections of [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]], which according to the 1911 ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' \"testifies to the industry of the writer but contains much immature philological speculation\".<ref name=\"eb1911\">{{cite book |page=945 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |volume=13 |year=1911 |url=https://archive.org/stream/EB1911WMF/VOL13_HARMONY-HURSTMONCEAUX#page/n973/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\nIn 1869 [[Richard Southwell Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo|Lord Mayo]], the then [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]], asked Hunter to submit a scheme for a comprehensive statistical survey of India. The work involved the compilation of a number of local gazetteers, in various stages of progress, and their consolidation in a condensed form upon a single and uniform plan. There was unhappiness with the scope and completeness of the earlier surveys conducted by administrators such as [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton|Buchanan]], and Hunter determined to model his efforts on the ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' and ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]''. Hunter said that \"It was my hope to make a memorial of England's work in India, more lasting, because truer and more complete, than these monuments of Mughal Empire and of French ambition.\"<ref name=Marriott2003p209>{{cite book |title=The other empire: metropolis, India and progress in the colonial imagination |first=John |last=Marriott |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7190-6018-2 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z2K0eVWnGmkC |page=209 |accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn response to Mayo's question on 30 May 1871 of whether the Indian Muslims are \"bound by their religion to rebel against the Queen\" Hunter completed his influential work ''The Indian Musalmans'' in mid-June 1871 and later published it as a book in mid-August of the same year.<ref>{{cite journal|author=v.

He was much hindered by the confused state of his materials, a portion of which he arranged and published in 1894 as ''Bengal Manuscript Records'', in three volumes.\n\nHunter dedicated his 1892 work ''Bombay 1885 to 1890: A Study in Indian Administration'' to [[Florence Nightingale]].<ref name=\"Nightingale2007\">{{cite book|author=Florence Nightingale|title=Florence Nightingale on Social Change in India: Collected Works of Florence Nightingale|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zaajLobsdS0C&pg=PA841|date=6 December 2007|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|isbn=978-0-88920-495-9|pages=841}}</ref>\n\nHis later works include the novel titled ''The Old Missionary'' (1895, described on the title-page as \"revised from ''[[The Contemporary Review]]''\"),<ref>{{cite news|title=The Old Missionary|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/5th-october-1895/19/the-old-missionary|accessdate=2014-12-23|newspaper=[[The Spectator]]|date=5 October 1895|page=19}}</ref> and ''The Thackerays in India'' (1897). John F.
