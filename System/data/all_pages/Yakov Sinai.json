He contributed to the modern metric theory of dynamical systems and connected the world of deterministic (dynamical) systems with the world of probabilistic (stochastic) systems.<ref name=Nature />  He has also worked on [[mathematical physics]] and [[probability theory]].<ref name=Nemmers />  His efforts have provided the groundwork for advances in the physical sciences.<ref name=Nature>{{cite news|title=Chaos-theory pioneer nabs Abel Prize|first=Philip|last=Ball|work=Nature|url=http://www.nature.com/news/chaos-theory-pioneer-nabs-abel-prize-1.14935|date=March 26, 2014|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSinai has won several awards, including the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics|Nemmers Prize]], the [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] and the [[Abel Prize]].\n\n== Biography ==\nYakov Grigorevich Sinai was born into a [[Russian Jewish]] academic family on September 21, 1935, in Moscow, [[Soviet Union]] (now Russia).<ref name=Abel /><ref>{{cite news|title=Legendary Russian academic Yakov Sinai awarded ‘math Nobel’|url=http://rt.com/news/sinai-math-abel-prize-641/|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=RT|date=March 27, 2014}}</ref>  His parents, Nadezda Kagan and Gregory Sinai, were both microbiologists. His grandfather, [[Veniamin Kagan]], headed the Department of\nDifferential Geometry at [[Moscow State University]] and was a major influence on Sinai's life.<ref name=Abel>{{cite web|title=Yakov G. Sinai|publisher=Abel Prize|url=http://www.abelprize.no/c61094/binfil/download.php?tid=61120|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSinai received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Moscow State University.<ref name=Nemmers />  In 1960, he earned his Ph.D., also from Moscow State; his adviser was [[Andrey Kolmogorov]]. Together with Kolmogorov, he showed that even for \"unpredictable\" dynamic systems, the level of unpredictability of motion can be described mathematically.  In their idea, which became known as [[Measure-preserving dynamical system|Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy]], a system with zero entropy is entirely predictable, while a system with non-zero entropy has an unpredictability factor directly related to the amount of entropy.<ref name=Nature />\n\nIn 1963, Sinai introduced the idea of [[dynamical billiards]], also known as \"Sinai Billiards\".  In this idealized system, a particle bounces around inside a square boundary without loss of energy.  Inside the square is a circular wall, of which the particle also bounces off.  He then proved that for most initial trajectories of the ball, this system is [[ergodic]], that is, after a long time, the amount of that time the ball will have spent in any given region on the surface of the table is approximately proportional to the area of that region.  It was the first time anyone proved a dynamic system was ergodic.<ref name=Nature />\n\nFrom 1960 to 1971, Sinai was a researcher in the Laboratory of Probabilistic and Statistical Methods at Moscow State.  In 1971, he was promoted to professor and named a senior researcher at the [[Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics]] in Russia.  Since 1993, Sinai has been a professor of mathematics at [[Princeton University]], while maintaining his position at the Landau Institute.  For the 1997–98 academic year, he was the Thomas Jones Professor at Princeton.  In 2005, the Moore Distinguished Scholar at the [[California Institute of Technology]].<ref name=Abel />\n\nSinai has supported the poet, mathematician and human rights activist [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]].<ref> [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/2001747/Yakov-Sinai-Year-In-Review-2014 Yakov Sinai: Year in review, 2014] by Erik Gregersen</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Sinai won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics|Nemmers Prize]] for his \"revolutionizing\" work on dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, probability theory, and statistical physics.<ref name=Nemmers>{{cite web|title=2002 Frederic Esser Nemmers Mathematics Prize Recipient|publisher=Northwestern University|url=http://www.nemmers.northwestern.edu/prizes/2002sinai.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>  In 2005, the ''[[Moscow Mathematical Journal]]'' dedicated an issue to Sinai writing \"Yakov Sinai is one of the greatest mathematicians of our time&nbsp;... his exceptional scientific enthusiasm inspire[d] several generations of scientists all over the world.\"<ref name=Abel />\n\nIn 2013, Sinai received the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] for Lifetime Achievement.<ref name=Abel /> In 2014, the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] awarded him the [[Abel Prize]], for his contributions to dynamical systems, [[ergodic theory]], and mathematical physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abelprize.no/c61094/seksjon/vis.html?tid=61095&strukt_tid=61094|title=The Abel Prize Laureate 2014|publisher=The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref>  Presenting the award, [[Jordan Ellenberg]] said Sinai had solved real world physical problems \"with the soul of a mathematician\".<ref name=Nature />  He praised the tools developed by Sinai which demonstrate how systems that look different may in fact have fundamental similarities.  The prize comes with 6 million [[Norwegian krone]],<ref name=Nature /> equivalent at the time to $US 1 million or £600,000.\n\nOther awards won by Sinai include the [[Boltzmann Medal]] (1986), the [[Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics]] (1990), the [[Dirac Prize]] (1992), the [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] (1997),  the [[Lagrange Prize]] (2008) and the [[Henri Poincaré Prize]] (2009).<ref name=Nemmers /><ref name=Abel /> He is a member of the United States [[National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=Nemmers />  He is an honorary member of the [[London Mathematical Society]] and, in 2012, he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref name=Nemmers /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list|title=List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>  Sinai has been selected an honorary member of the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]], the [[Academia Europaea]], the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], and the [[Royal Society]] of London.  He holds honorary degrees from the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]], the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], [[Warwick University]], and [[Warsaw University]].<ref name=Abel />\n\nSinai has authored more than 250 papers and books. Concepts in mathematics named after him include Sinai's random walk, Sinai–Ruelle–Bowen measures, and Pirogov–Sinai theory.  Sinai has overseen more than 50 Ph.D. candidates.<ref name=Abel />  He has spoken at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] four times.<ref name=Nemmers />  In 2000, he was a plenary speaker at the First Latin American Congress in Mathematics.<ref name=Abel />\n\nSinai is married to mathematician and physicist Elena B.
