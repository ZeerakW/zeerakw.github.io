He is known for his research in [[probability theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[mathematical analysis]], [[theoretical computer science]], and in particular for topics such as [[fractals]] and [[Hausdorff measure]], [[random walk]]s, [[Brownian motion]], [[percolation]] and [[Markov chain mixing time]]s. He was born in Israel and obtained his Ph.D. at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in 1990 under the supervision of [[Hillel Furstenberg]].<ref name=\"ams\" /> He was a faculty member at the Hebrew University and the [[University of California at Berkeley]].<ref name=\"ams\" />\n\nPeres was awarded the [[Rollo Davidson Prize]] in 1995 and the [[Loève Prize]] in\n2001.<ref name=\"ams\">{{cite journal | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200109/people.pdf | title = Peres Receives 2001 Loève Prize | author = David Aldous | authorlink = David Aldous |date=October 2001 | volume = 49 | number = 9 | pages = 999–1000 | publisher = Notices of the AMS}}</ref>  He was an [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 2002.
