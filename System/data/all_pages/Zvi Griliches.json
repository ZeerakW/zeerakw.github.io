The works by Zvi Griliches mostly concerned the [[economics]] of [[technological change]], including [[empirical research|empirical studies]] of [[diffusion of innovations]] and the role of R & D, patents, and education.\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]] in an [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jewish]] family that spoke [[Russian Language|Russian]] at home. During [[World War II]] he was sent to the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. In 1947 he emigrated to [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]], where he served in the pre-state [[Israeli army]], learned [[Hebrew]], passed high school equivalence exam, and studied for a year at [[Hebrew University]].  He then moved to the United States, where he earned a [[B.S.]] in Agricultural Economics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and then a Ph.D. in Economics at the [[University of Chicago]], supervised by [[Theodore Schultz]].\n\nIn his classic 1957 Ph.D. dissertation, ''Hybrid Corn: An Exploration in the Economics of Technological Change'', published as an article in the October 1957 issue of ''[[Econometrica]]'', Griliches demonstrated that the penetration of corn seeds followed the [[logistic curve]]. It was found later through multiple examples by [[Edwin Mansfield]] and other researchers that this is a general rule for [[technological change]] / [[diffusion of innovations]]. The dissertation was one of the first scientific works that treated the development of new technology as an economic phenomenon. Previously, economists had treated it as exogenous.\n\nMost innovations either make production more efficient, or improve the quality of goods. The analysis of measurement of the impact of innovations on economics led Griliches to his fundamental studies of [[economic growth]], [[productivity]], [[production function]], [[consumption function]], measurements of economic input and output, [[hedonic regression|hedonic prices]], and their reflection in [[consumer price index|price indices]].\n\nGriliches also published important works of [[econometrics]], including [[distributed lags]] ([[time series]]) and aggregation. He was particularly interested in the measurements of hidden variables.\n\nGriliches served as the President of the [[Econometric Society]] in 1975, and as the President of the [[American Economic Association]] in 1993. From 1969 to 1977 he was one of editors of the journal ''[[Econometrica]]''. He served on the [[Stigler Commission]] in 1961 and the [[Boskin Commission]] in 1996, both of which were convened by the [[United States Senate]] to evaluate the measurement of [[inflation]].\n\nIn 1965, Zvi Griliches won the prestigious [[John Bates Clark Medal]]. He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1965 and to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1975. He was also elected Distinguished Fellow of the [[American Economic Association]], Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]], Fellow of the [[American Statistical Association]], Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and Fellow of the [[American Agricultural Economics Association]].\n\n==Memorials and tributes==\nThe Zvi Griliches Research Data Center<ref>http://www.neaman.org.il/Neaman/data_centers/dc_issues_list.asp</ref> was established in his memory at the [[Samuel Neaman Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology]] in Israel. The Zvi Griliches Excellence Award<ref>https://eerc.ru/article/zvi-griliches-award-1</ref> was established by the [[Economics Education and Research Consortium]] (EERC) in Russia and other former Soviet Union countries.\n\nThe Zvi Griliches Research Seminar in the Economics of Innovation<ref>http://www.barcelonagse.eu/Zvi_Griliches_Summer_School_in_Economics_of_Innovation.html</ref> is held annually by the [[Barcelona Graduate School of Economics]] to promote interactions between academic researchers, innovation policy practitioners, statistical office analysts and PhD students with a general interest in analyzing technological innovation from an economic point of view.<ref>[http://www.barcelonagse.eu/Zvi_Griliches_Summer_School_in_Economics_of_Innovation.html Barcelona GSE Summer Schools | Zvi Griliches Research Seminar]</ref>\n\n==References==\n* [http://cba.unomaha.edu/faculty/adiamond/web/DiamondPDFs/GrilProofs.pdf Diamond, Arthur M., Jr. \"Zvi Griliches's Contributions to the Economics of Technology and Growth.\" ''Economics of Innovation and New Technology'' 13, no. 4 (June 2004): 365–97.]\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/zgrilich/default.htm Zvi Griliches' homepage]\n* [http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/02.27/16-mm.html Obituary published in the ''Harvard Gazette'']\n* [http://news.ucanr.org/newsstorymain.cfm?story=174 Obituary on the University of California website]\n* [http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/zgriliches.pdf A Biographical Memoir by Marc Nerlove]\n* [http://siepr.stanford.edu/papers/pdf/02-45.pdf Zvi Griliches on Diffusion, Lags and Productivity Growth ...Connecting the Dots by Paul A.
