The profession exists in both the private and [[public sector]]s. It is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects.\n\n==Nature of the work==\nAccording to the United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], as of 2014, 26,970 jobs were classified as ''statistician'' in the United States.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates. Statisticians:Employment]</ref> Of these people, approximately 30 percent worked for governments (federal, state, or local). Additionally, there is a substantial number of people who use statistics in their work but have job titles other than ''statistician'',<ref>[http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm Statisticians]</ref> such as [[Actuary|actuaries]], [[Applied mathematics|applied mathematicians]], [[economist]]s, [[financial analyst]]s, [[psychometrician]]s, [[epidemiologist]]s, and [[Quantitative psychology|quantitative psychologists]].<ref>United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Retrieved 2007-10-03.</ref> The job of statistician is considered a [[profession]]. Most statisticians work in offices and have regular working hours and can therefore be considered [[white-collar worker]]s. A minority of statisticians are self-employed [[statistical consultant]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nMost employment as a statistician requires a minimum of a [[masters degree]] in statistics or a related field. Many professional statisticians have a [[PhD]]. Typical work includes collaborating with scientists, providing mathematical modeling, simulations, designing randomized experiments and randomized sampling plans, analyzing experimental or survey results, and  forecasting future events (such as sales of a product).\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of statisticians]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Statisticians}}\n*[http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm Statistician entry, Occupational Outlook Handbook, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]\n*[http://www.amstat.org/careers/index.cfm?fuseaction=main Careers Center, American Statistical Association]\n*[http://www.careersinstatistics.co.uk/ Careers information, Royal Statistical Society  (UK) ]\n*[http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco88/2122.htm Listing of tasks and duties - The International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO)]\n*[http://online.onetcenter.org/link/summary/15-2041.00  Listings of nature of work etc - O*NET]\n\n{{Statistics}}\n\n[[Category:Statisticians| ]]\n[[Category:Mathematical science occupations|Statistician]]\n[[Category:Occupations|Statistician]]\n\n{{job-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Statistician"}}}}
