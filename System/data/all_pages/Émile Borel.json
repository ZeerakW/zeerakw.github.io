As a mathematician, he was known for his founding work in the areas of [[measure theory]] and [[probability]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorel was born in [[Saint-Affrique]], [[Aveyron]], the son of a [[Protestant]] pastor.<ref name=\"McElroy 2009\">{{cite book |author=McElroy, Tucker |title=A to Z of Mathematicians |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MiZIWtX9AJUC&pg=PA46 |year=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-4381-0921-3 |page=46}}</ref> He studied at the [[Collège Sainte-Barbe]] and [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] before applying to both the [[École normale supérieure]] and the [[École Polytechnique]]. Although he qualified for both, he chose to attend the former institution in 1889. That year he won the [[concours général]], an annual national mathematics competition. After graduating in 1892, he placed first in the [[agrégation]], a competitive civil service examination leading to the position of professeur agrégé. His thesis, published in 1893, was titled ''Sur quelques points de la théorie des fonctions'' (\"On some points in the theory of functions\"). That year, Borel started a four-year stint as a lecturer at the [[University of Lille]], during which time he published 22 research papers. He returned to the École normale in 1897, and was appointed to the chair of theory of function, which he held until 1941.<ref name=\"Chang 2011\">{{cite book |author=Chang, Sooyoung |title=Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4siw31DPONUC&pg=PA107 |year=2011 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-4282-29-1 |page=107}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, Borel married 17-year-old Marguerite, the daughter of colleague [[Paul Émile Appel]]; she later wrote more than 30 novels under the pseudonym [[Camille Marbo]]. Émile Borel died in Paris on 3 February 1956.<ref name=\"Chang 2011\"/>\n\n==Work==\nAlong with [[René-Louis Baire]] and [[Henri Lebesgue]], Émile Borel was among the pioneers of [[measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] and its application to [[probability theory]]. The concept of a [[Borel set]] is named in his honor. One of his books on probability introduced the amusing [[thought experiment]] that entered popular culture under the name [[infinite monkey theorem]] or the like.  He also published a series of papers (1921–27) that first defined [[game theory|games of strategy]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/74060/Emile-Borel \"Émile Borel,\" ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']</ref>\n\nIn 1913 and 1914 he bridged the gap between [[hyperbolic geometry]] and [[special relativity]] with expository work. For instance, his book ''Introduction Geometrique à quelques Théories Physiques''<ref>Émile Borel (1914) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=04710001 Introduction Geometrique à quelques Théories Physiques], Gauthier-Villars, link from [[Cornell University]] Historical Math Monographs</ref> described [[hyperbolic rotation]]s as transformations that leave a hyperbola [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|stable]] just as a circle around a rotational center is stable.\n\n==Political career==\nIn the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, he was active in politics. In 1922, he founded [[Paris Institute of Statistics]], the oldest French school for statistics. From 1924 to 1936, he was a member of the [[French National Assembly]]. In 1925, he was [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Minister of Marine]] in the cabinet of fellow mathematician [[Paul Painlevé]]. During the [[Second World War]], he was a member of the [[French Resistance]].\n\n==Honors==\n\nBesides the ''Centre Émile Borel'' at the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris\nand a [[Borel (crater)|crater on the Moon]], the following mathematical notions are named after him:\n{{colbegin||25em}}\n*[[Borel algebra]],\n*[[Borel's lemma]],\n*[[Borel's law of large numbers]],\n*[[Borel measure]],\n*[[Borel–Kolmogorov paradox]],\n*[[Borel–Cantelli lemma]],\n*[[Borel–Carathéodory theorem]],\n*[[Heine–Borel theorem]],\n*[[Borel summation]],\n*[[Borel distribution]].\n{{colend}}\n\nBorel also described a [[poker]] model which he coins ''[[La Relance]]'' in his 1938 book ''Applications de la théorie des probabilités aux Jeux de Hasard''.<ref>Émile Borel and Jean Ville.
