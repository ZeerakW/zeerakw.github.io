Aleksei Vasil'evich Pogorelov (Russian: Алексе́й Васи́льевич Погоре́лов, Ukrainian: Олексі́й Васи́льович Погорє́лов; March 2, 1919 – December 17, 2002), was a Soviet and Ukrainian mathematician. He was most famous for his contributions to convex and differential geometry. He was also the author of a number of influential research monographs as well as popular high school and college textbooks.   == BiographyEdit == Pogorelov was born in Korocha, Kursk Governorate, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (now Belgorod Oblast, Russia) and died in Moscow. For much of his life he worked in Kharkiv (Ukraine) (from 1937 until 2000), first at the Kharkiv State University and then at the B Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering. He wrote his dissertation under the supervision of A.D. Alexandrov and Nikolai Efimov. His books on intrinsic geometry of convex bodies, Hilbert's fourth problem, multidimensional Minkowski problem, and Monge–Ampère equation were translated to other languages and became standard in the field. Pogorelov was a member of the Soviet and Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, recipient of Stalin Prize (1950), Lobachevsky International Prize (1959), Lenin Prize (1962), and other honours.   == Selected publicationsEdit == Topics in the theory of surfaces in elliptic spaces.
