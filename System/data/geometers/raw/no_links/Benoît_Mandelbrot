This is a redirect from a page name that has diacritical marks (accents, umlauts, etc.) to essentially the same page name without those marks. For more information follow the bold category link. Apply this redirect (without piping) when the subject page concerns language translation or foreign language equivalents. Other pages that use this redirect should be updated with a direct link to the redirect target (again, without piping). Sort these redirects with {{DEFAULTSORT:(title without diacritics)}}.
