Élie Joseph Cartan (French: [kaʁtɑ̃]; 9 April 1869 – 6 May 1951) was an influential French mathematician who did fundamental work in the theory of Lie groups and their geometric applications. He also made significant contributions to mathematical physics, differential geometry, and group theory. He was the father of another influential mathematician, Henri Cartan, and the composer Jean Cartan.   == Life == Élie Cartan was born in the village of Dolomieu, Isère, the son of a blacksmith. He attended the Lycée Janson de Sailly before studying at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1888 and obtaining his doctorate in 1894. He subsequently held lecturing positions in Montpellier and Lyon, becoming a professor in Nancy in 1903. He took a lecturing position at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1909, becoming professor there in 1912 until his retirement in 1940. Also in 1938 he participated in the International Committee composed to organise the International Congresses for the Unity of Science. He died in Paris after a long illness. In 1937 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.   == Work == By his own account, in his Notice sur les travaux scientifiques, the main theme of his works (numbering 186 and published throughout the period 1893–1947) was the theory of Lie groups. He began by working over the foundational material on the complex simple Lie algebras, tidying up the previous work by Friedrich Engel and Wilhelm Killing. This proved definitive, as far as the classification went, with the identification of the four main families and the five exceptional cases. He also introduced the algebraic group concept, which was not to be developed seriously before 1950. He defined the general notion of anti-symmetric differential form, in the style now used; his approach to Lie groups through the Maurer–Cartan equations required 2-forms for their statement. At that time what were called Pfaffian systems (i.e. first-order differential equations given as 1-forms) were in general use; by the introduction of fresh variables for derivatives, and extra forms, they allowed for the formulation of quite general PDE systems. Cartan added the exterior derivative, as an entirely geometric and coordinate-independent operation. It naturally leads to the need to discuss p-forms, of general degree p. Cartan writes of the influence on him of Charles Riquier’s general PDE theory. With these basics — Lie groups and differential forms — he went on to produce a very large body of work, and also some general techniques such as moving frames, that were gradually incorporated into the mathematical mainstream. In the Travaux, he breaks down his work into 15 areas. Using modern terminology, they are these: Lie theory Representations of Lie groups Hypercomplex numbers, division algebras Systems of PDEs, Cartan–Kähler theorem Theory of equivalence Integrable systems, theory of prolongation and systems in involution Infinite-dimensional groups and pseudogroups Differential geometry and moving frames Generalised spaces with structure groups and connections, Cartan connection, holonomy, Weyl tensor Geometry and topology of Lie groups Riemannian geometry Symmetric spaces Topology of compact groups and their homogeneous spaces Integral invariants and classical mechanics Relativity, spinors   == See also == List of things named after Élie Cartan Integrability conditions for differential systems CAT(k) space   == Publications == Cartan, Élie (1894), Sur la structure des groupes de transformations finis et continus, Thesis, Nony  Leçons sur les invariants intégraux, Hermann, Paris, 1922 La Géométrie des espaces de Riemann, 1925 Leçons sur la géométrie des espaces de Riemann, Gauthiers-Villars, 1928 La théorie des groups finis et continus et l'analysis situs, Gauthiers-Villars, 1930 Leçons sur la géométrie projective complexe, Gauthiers-Villars, 1931 La parallelisme absolu et la théorie unitaire du champ, Hermann, 1932 La méthode de repère mobile, la théorie des groupes continus, et les espaces généralisés, 1935 Leçons sur la théorie des espaces à connexion projective, Gauthiers-Villars, 1937 La théorie des groupes finis et continus et la géométrie différentielle traitées par la méthode du repère mobile, Gauthiers-Villars, 1937 Cartan, Élie (1981) [1938], The theory of spinors, New York: Dover Publications, ISBN 978-0-486-64070-9, MR 631850  Les systèmes différentiels extérieurs et leurs applications géométriques, Hermann, 1945 Oeuvres complètes, 3 parts in 6 vols., Paris 1952 to 1955, reprinted by CNRS 1984: Part 1: Groupes de Lie (in 2 vols.), 1952 Part 2, Vol. 1: Algèbre, formes différentielles, systèmes différentiels, 1953 Part 2, Vol. 2: Groupes finis, Systèmes différentiels, théories d'équivalence, 1953 Part 3, Vol. 1: Divers, géométrie différentielle, 1955 Part 3, Vol. 2: Géométrie différentielle, 1955   == References ==   == External links == M.A. Akivis & B.A. Rosenfeld (1993) Élie Cartan (1869–1951), translated from Russian original by V.V.
