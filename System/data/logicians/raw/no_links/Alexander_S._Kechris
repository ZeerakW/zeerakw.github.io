Alexander (Alekos) Sotirios Kechris (Greek: Αλέξανδρος Σωτήριος Κεχρής; born 1946, Greece) is a descriptive set theorist and ergodic theorist at Caltech. He has made major contributions to the theory of Borel equivalence relations and the theory of automorphism groups of uncountable structures. Kechris earned his Ph.D. in 1972 under the direction of Yiannis N. Moschovakis, with a dissertation titled Projective Ordinals and Countable Analytic Sets. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.   == Selected publications == A. S. Kechris, "Classical Descriptive Set Theory", Springer-Verlag, 1995. H. Becker, A. S.
