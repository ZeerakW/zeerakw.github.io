Anne Sjerp Troelstra (born 10 August 1939) is Emeritus professor of pure mathematics and foundations of mathematics at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) of the University of Amsterdam. He is a constructivist logician, who has been influential in the development of intuitionistic logic. With Georg Kreisel, he was a developer of the theory of choice sequences. He also wrote one of the first texts on linear logic, and with H. Schwichtenberg he co-wrote an important book on proof theory.   == Notes == ^ Daimiposten – Oktober 2001 ^ MARTIN LÖB (1921–2006) ^ Marion, Mathieu (1998), Wittgenstein, Finitism, and the Foundations of Mathematics, New York: Oxford University Press, p. 205, ISBN 0-19-823516-X . ^ Jervell, Herman Ruge (1996), "Review: Lectures on Linear Logic by A.
