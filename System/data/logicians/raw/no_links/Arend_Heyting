Arend Heyting (Dutch: [ˈɦɛi̯tɪŋ]; 9 May 1898 – 9 July 1980) was a Dutch mathematician and logician. He was a student of Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer at the University of Amsterdam, and did much to put intuitionistic logic on a footing where it could become part of mathematical logic. Heyting gave the first formal development of intuitionistic logic in order to codify Brouwer's way of doing mathematics. The inclusion of Brouwer's name in the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation is largely honorific, as Brouwer was opposed in principle to the formalisation of certain intuitionistic principles (and went as far as calling Heyting's work a "sterile exercise"). In 1942 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Heyting was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and died in Lugano, Switzerland.   == Selected publications == Heyting, A.
