Robert Bernard Meyer (born August 4, 1939, in Toledo, Ohio) is an American former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1960. Meyer pitched for the Yankees (1964), Los Angeles Angels (1964), Kansas City Athletics (1964), Seattle Pilots (1969), and Milwaukee Brewers (1970). His first major league strikeout victim was future Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski. During a 3-year baseball career, Meyer compiled 2 wins, 92 strikeouts, and a 4.38 earned run average. Meyer is probably best known for being the loser in the best big league game he ever pitched. On September 12, 1964, while starting for the Athletics on the road at Memorial Stadium, he and Baltimore Orioles left-hander Frank Bertaina each pitched a complete game one-hitter, but the A's lost 1-0 as Jackie Brandt hit a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the 8th to score pinch-runner Bob Saverine from third. Other career highlights include a six scoreless inning win against the Kansas City Athletics on June 26, 1964, a six-hit, complete game win (6-1) against the Baltimore Orioles on September 7, 1964, and pitching the first nine innings and giving up one unearned run in a 13-inning victory over the New York Yankees on September 1, 1969.   == External links ==  Career statistics and player information from Baseball-Reference, or Baseball-Reference (Minors) Retrosheet Baseball Library
