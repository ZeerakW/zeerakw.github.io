Ehud Hrushovski (Hebrew: אהוד הרושובסקי‎; born 1959) is a mathematical logician. He is a Professor of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He earned his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1986 under Leo Harrington He was Professor of Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology until 1998 before he went to Jerusalem. His father, Benjamin Harshav (né Hruszowski; 1928-2015), was a literary theorist, a Yiddish and Hebrew poet and a translator, Professor at Yale University and Tel Aviv University in comparative literature. Hrushovski is well known for many fundamental and important contributions to model theory, in particular in the branch that has become known as geometric model theory, and its applications. His PhD thesis revolutionized stable model theory (a part of model theory arising from the stability theory introduced by Saharon Shelah). Shortly afterwards he found counterexamples to the Trichotomy Conjecture of Boris Zilber and his method of proof has become well known as Hrushovski constructions and found many other applications since. In 1996, Hrushovski found a proof the geometric Mordell–Lang conjecture in all characteristics using model theory. This deep proof was a landmark in logic and geometry. He has had many other famous results in model theory and applications to Diophantine geometry. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2007), and Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (2008).   == See also == Zariski geometry   == References ==   == External links == Ehud Hrushovski at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
