Hendrik Pieter (Henk) Barendregt (born 18 December 1947, Amsterdam) is a Dutch logician, known for his work in lambda calculus and type theory.   == Life and work == Barendregt studied mathematical logic at Utrecht University, obtaining his Masters in 1968 and his Ph.D. in 1971, both cum laude, under Dirk van Dalen and Georg Kreisel. After a postdoctoral position at Stanford University, he taught at Utrecht University. Since 1986, Barendregt has taught at Radboud University Nijmegen, where he now holds the Chair of Foundations of Mathematics and Computer Science. His research group works on Constructive Interactive Mathematics. He is also Adjunct Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA. He has been a visiting scholar at Darmstadt, ETH Zürich, Siena, and Kyoto. In 1997 Barendregt was elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. On 6 February 2003 Barendregt was awarded the Spinozapremie for 2002, the highest scientific award in the Netherlands. In 2002 he was knighted in the Orde van de Nederlandse Leeuw.   == Selected publications == H.P. Barendregt (1985). The Lambda Calculus — Its Syntax and Semantics.
