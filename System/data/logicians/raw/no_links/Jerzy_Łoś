Jerzy Łoś (born March 22, 1920 in Lwów, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine)-June 1, 1998 in Warsaw) (Polish pronunciation: [ˈjɛʐɨ ˈwɔɕ]) was a Polish mathematician, logician, economist, and philosopher. He is best known for his work on ultraproducts, in particular for "Łoś's theorem", which states that any first-order formula is true in an ultraproduct if and only if it is true in "most" factors (see ultraproduct for details). He was faculty at academies in Wrocław, Toruń, and Warsaw. In 1996 Łoś suffered from a severe brain stroke. He was thenceforward ill until his death in 1998.   == Selected publications == Łoś, Jerzy (1955) Quelques remarques, théorèmes et problèmes sur les classes définissables d'algèbres.
