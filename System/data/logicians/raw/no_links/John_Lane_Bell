John Lane Bell (born March 25, 1945) is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Western Ontario in Canada. He has made contributions to mathematical logic and philosophy, and is the author of a number of books. His research includes such topics as set theory, model theory, lattice theory, modal logic, quantum logic, constructive mathematics, type theory, topos theory, infinitesimal analysis, spacetime theory, and the philosophy of mathematics. He is the author of more than 70 articles and of 11 books. In 2009, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. He was awarded a scholarship to Oxford University at the age of 15, and graduated with a D.Phil. in Mathematics: his dissertation supervisor was John Crossley. During 1968-89 he was Lecturer in Mathematics and Reader in Mathematical Logic at the London School of Economics. John Bell's students include Graham Priest (Ph.D. Mathematics LSE, 1972), Michael Hallett (Ph.D. Philosophy LSE, 1979), Elaine Landry (Ph.D. Philosophy UWO, 1997), David DeVidi (Ph.D. Philosophy UWO, 1994) and Richard Feist (Ph.D. Philosophy UWO, 1999).   == Bibliography ==   === Books === Intuitionistic Set Theory.
