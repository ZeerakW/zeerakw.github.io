Leo Anthony Harrington (born 1946) is a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley who works in recursion theory, model theory, and set theory. Harrington and Jeff Paris proved the Parisâ€“Harrington theorem. Harrington showed that if the Axiom of Determinacy holds for all analytic sets then x# exists for all reals x. Harrington and Saharon Shelah showed that the first order theory of the partially ordered set of recursively enumerable Turing degrees is undecidable.   == References ==   == External links == Home page.
