Martin David Davis (born 1928) is an American mathematician, known for his work on Hilbert's tenth problem.   == Biography == Davis's parents were Jewish immigrants to the US from Łódź, Poland, and married after they met again in New York City. Davis grew up in the Bronx, where his parents encouraged him to obtain a full education. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1950, where his adviser was Alonzo Church. He is Professor Emeritus at New York University.   == Contributions == Davis is the co-inventor of the Davis–Putnam algorithm and the DPLL algorithms. He is also known for his model of Post–Turing machines.   == Awards and honors == In 1975, Davis won the Leroy P. Steele Prize, the Chauvenet Prize (with Reuben Hersh), and in 1974 the Lester R. Ford Award for his expository writlng related to his work on Hilbert's tenth problem. He became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982, and in 2012, he was selected as one of the inaugural fellows of the American Mathematical Society.   == Selected publications == Books Davis, Martin (1977).
