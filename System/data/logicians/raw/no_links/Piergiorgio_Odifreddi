Piergiorgio Odifreddi (born July 13, 1950 in Cuneo), is an Italian mathematician, logician and aficionado of the history of science, who is also extremely active as a popular science writer and essayist, especially in a perspective of philosophical atheism as a member of the Italian Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics. He's philosophically and politically near to Bertrand Russell and Noam Chomsky. Born in Cuneo (Piedmont), he received his Laurea in mathematics in Turin in 1973. From 1983 to 2002, he taught in both Italy (Turin, Alessandria, Siena, Milan) and in the United States (Cornell University). Since 2001, he has been a professor of mathematical logic in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Turin. He has written editorials and books reviews for La rivista dei libri (the Italian edition of the New York Review of Books), is a regular contributor to Le Scienze (the Italian edition of Scientific American), and has also written for several newspapers such as La Repubblica, La Stampa and the weekly L'Espresso. The television stations Radio Tre, RAI Due and RAI Tre have hosted many of his discussions on various scientific topics. Piergiorgio Odifreddi participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2007.   == Honors == 1998 – Galileo Prize of the Italian Mathematical Union. 2002 – Peano Prize of Mathesis 2005 – Commander OMRI   == Works ==   === Academic writings === Classical recursion Theory, North Holland – Elsevier, 1988, ISBN 9780080886596; 2nd edn. 1992, ISBN 0-444-89483-7 Classical recursion Theory.
