Pyotr Sergeyevich Novikov (Russian: Пётр Серге́евич Но́виков; 15 August 1901, Moscow, Russian Empire – 9 January 1975, Moscow, Soviet Union) was a Soviet mathematician. Novikov is known for his work on combinatorial problems in group theory: the word problem for groups, and Burnside's problem. For proving the undecidability of the word problem in groups he was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1957. In 1953 he became a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences and in 1960 he was elected a full member. He was married to the mathematician Lyudmila Keldysh (1904–1976). The mathematician Sergei Novikov is his son. Sergei Adian and Albert Muchnik were among his students.   == References ==   == External links == O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., "Pyotr Novikov", MacTutor History of Mathematics archive, University of St Andrews .
