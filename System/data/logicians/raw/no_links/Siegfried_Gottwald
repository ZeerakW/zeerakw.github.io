Siegfried Johannes Gottwald (30 March 1943 – 20 September 2015) was a German mathematician, logician and historian of science.   == Life and work == Gottwald was born in Limbach, Saxony in 1943. From 1961 to 1966, he studied mathematics at the University of Leipzig, where he was awarded his doctor title in 1969 and his habilitation in 1977. He was tenured professor of non-classical and mathematical logic at University of Leipzig where he taught from 1972 to his retirement in 2008. His main research areas are fuzzy sets and fuzzy methodologies, many-valued logic and history of mathematics. He published several books on many-valued logic, fuzzy sets and their applications, co-authored a textbook on calculus and a reader in the history of logic. He also contributed to the German biographical dictionary of mathematicians, Lexikon berühmter Mathematiker. Professor Gottwald was Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Philosophy at University of Leipzig for several years. He was married with three children.   == Published books == H. Bock, S.
