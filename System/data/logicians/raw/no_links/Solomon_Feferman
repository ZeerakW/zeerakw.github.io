Solomon Feferman (born December 13, 1928) is an American philosopher and mathematician with works in mathematical logic. He was born in New York City, New York, and received his Ph.D. in 1957 from the University of California, Berkeley under Alfred Tarski. He is Patrick Suppes Professor Emeritus of Humanities and Sciences, with appointments in the Departments of Mathematics and Philosophy at Stanford University. Feferman was awarded the Schock Prize in logic and philosophy in 2003 and delivered the Tarski Lectures in 2006. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. Feferman was the editor-in-chief of the Collected Works of Kurt Gödel.   == Selected publications == In the Light of Logic (Oxford University Press, 1998, ISBN 0-19-508030-0, Logic and Computation in Philosophy series) review.
