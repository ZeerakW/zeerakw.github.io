Stewart Shapiro (born 1951) is O'Donnell Professor of Philosophy at the Ohio State University and a regular visiting professor at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He is a figure in the philosophy of mathematics where he defends a version of structuralism. He studied Mathematics and Philosophy at Case Western Reserve University in 1973. Then, he got his M.A. in Mathematics at the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1975. He transferred to the UB Philosophy Department, where three years later he received a Ph.D. His doctoral supervisor was John Corcoran.   == Publications ==   === Books === Philosophy of Mathematics: Structure and Ontology.
