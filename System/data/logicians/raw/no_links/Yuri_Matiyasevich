Yuri Vladimirovich Matiyasevich, (Russian: Ю́рий Влади́мирович Матиясе́вич; born March 2, 1947, in Leningrad) is a Russian mathematician and computer scientist. He is best known for his negative solution of Hilbert's tenth problem (Matiyasevich's Theorem), presented in his doctoral thesis, at LOMI (the Leningrad Department of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics).   == Biography == In 1962–1963, Matiyasevich studied at Saint Petersburg Lyceum 239; In 1963–1964, he studied at Kolmogorov School; In 1964–1969, Matiyasevich studied at Mathematics & Mechanics Faculty of Leningrad State University. As a winner of IMO Yuri Matiyasevich was accepted without exams to LSU, skipping the last year of high school studies. In 1966, he presented a talk at International Congress of Mathematicians held in Moscow. He was a second-year undergraduate student at that time. In 1969–1970, he pursued Ph.D. studies at Leningrad Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics under supervision of Sergey Maslov. In 1970, he received his Ph.D. degree at LOMI. In 1970–1974, he was a researcher at LOMI. In 1972, he obtained a second doctoral degree (called "doktor nauk" in Soviet Union). In 1974–1980, he was a senior researcher at LOMI. Since 1980, Yuri Matiyasevich has been the head of Laboratory of mathematical logic at LOMI. Since 1995, he has been a professor of Saint-Petersburg State University, initially at the chair of software engineering, later at the chair of algebra and number theory. In 1997, he was elected as a corresponding member of Russian Academy of Sciences. Since 1998, Yuri Matiyasevich has been a vice-president of St. Petersburg Mathematical Society. Since 2002, he has been a head of St.Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad. Since 2003, Matiyasevich has been a co-director of annual German–Russian student school JASS. In 2008, he was elected as a full member of Russian Academy of Sciences.   == Awards and honors == In 1964, Yuri Matiyasevich won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad held in Moscow. In 1970, he was awarded the "Young mathematician" prize of the Leningrad Mathematical Society. In 1980, he received a Markov Prize of Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In 1996, he received his Docteur Honoris Causa de l'Université d'Auvergne. In 1998, he received Humboldt Research Award to Outstanding Scholars. In 2003, he was granted his Docteur Honoris Causa de l'Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris-6). In 2007, he was elected to Bayern Academy of Sciences.   == Notable facts == A polynomial related to colorings of triangulation of sphere was named after Matiyasevich; see The Matiyasevich polynomial, four colour theorem and weight systems. He was a member of the American Mathematical Society and the Association for Symbolic Logic; and also of the editorial boards for the journals Discrete Mathematics and Applications and Computer Instruments in Education. Notable students include: Eldar Musayev, Maxim Vsemirnov, Alexei Pastor, Dmitri Karpov.   == Selected works ==   === Book === Yuri Matiyasevich Hilbert's 10th Problem, Foreword by Martin Davis and Hilary Putnam, The MIT Press, 1993.
