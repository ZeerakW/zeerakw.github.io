Allison has been described as one of the leading skeptics regarding commonly issued nutrition advice. Author Judith Stern wrote "He is also known for challenging conventional ideas, exploring novel hypotheses, and holding himself and others to rigorous standards of evidence." Although Allison has had some critics regarding his stance on questioning the link between consuming any one particular food and obesity, he has been defended by others and praised for his strong adherence to solid scientific practice.  Allison is the founding Field Chief Editor of Frontiers in Genetics. He also serves as a frequent consultant and expert witness in the legal setting.   == Alleged conflicts of interest == In 2008, Allison resigned as president-elect of the Obesity Society after signing an affidavit opposing a law that would have required calorie counts to be listed on restaurant menus. The New York Times reported that Allison's affidavit "ran counter to the conventional thinking in his field" and provoked criticism from some members of the Society. In 2011, ABC News ran a story about Allison. The story quoted him as saying there was too little "solid evidence" to support a link between soft drink consumption and obesity. The article noted that "...critics say his skepticism stems from his financial ties to entities such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi and the American Beverage Association..." Allison was featured in the 2014 documentary film Fed Up, which criticized his research for being funded by food companies. Allison responded that "the film-makers’ behavior seems counter to thoughtful dialogue," although he added that he had not seen the film yet and so could not provide a detailed response.    == References ==   == External links == Full CV
