Peter Gavin Hall FAA FRS AO (born 20 November 1951) is an Australian researcher in probability theory and mathematical statistics. He earned his Doctorate at the University of Oxford in 1976.   == Biography == Dr. Hall was born to radiophysics and radio astronomy pioneer Ruby Payne-Scott and telephone technician William Holman Hall. His younger sister is artistic photographer and sculptor, Fiona Margaret Hall. Hall is an author in probability and statistics. Mathscinet lists him with more than 500 publications as of January 2008. He has made contributions to nonparametric statistics, in particular for curve estimation and resampling: the bootstrap method, smoothing, density estimation, and bandwidth selection. He has worked on numerous applications across fields of economics, engineering, physical science and biological science. Hall has also made contributions to surface roughness measurement using fractals. In probability theory he has made many contributions to limit theory, spatial processes and stochastic geometry. His paper "Theoretical comparison of bootstrap confidence intervals" (Annals of Statistics, 1988) has been reprinted in the Breakthroughs in Statistics collection. Professor Hall is currently an ARC Laureate Fellow at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbourne, and also has a joint appointment at University of California Davis. He previously held a professorship at the Centre for Mathematics and its Applications at the Australian National University.   == Main Honours and Awards == 2013 Foreign Associate, National Academy of Sciences 2013 Officer of the Order of Australia 2011 Guy Medal in Silver 2010 George Szekeres Medal 2007 Matthew Flinders Medal and Lecture  2000 Fellow of the Royal Society of London 1996 Fellow of the American Statistical Association 1994 Hannan Medal of the Australian Academy of Science 1989 Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies Award 1987 Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science 1986 Rollo Davidson Prize, University of Cambridge 1986 Australian Mathematical Society Medal 1984 Fellow of Institute of Mathematical Statistics   == Bibliography == P.
