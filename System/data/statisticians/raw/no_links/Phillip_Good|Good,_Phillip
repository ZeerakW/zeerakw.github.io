Phillip I. Good (born in 1937) is a Canadian-American mathematical statistician. He was educated at McGill University and the University of California at Berkeley. He was among the first to apply the bootstrap in his 1975 analyses of 2×2 designs with a missing cell. His chief contributions to statistics are in the area of small sample statistics, including a uniformly most powerful unbiased (UMPU) permutation test for Type I censored data, an exact test for comparing variances, and an exact test for cross-over designs.   == Selected publications ==  His published texts in statistics include the following: The A to Z of Error-Free Research,Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2012.
