Robert René ('René') Kuczynski (1876–1947) was a German-based, Jewish economist and demographer and is said to be one of the founders of modern vital statistics. Jürgen Kuczynski is his son. His father Wilhelm was a banker. René studied at the universities of Berlin, Munich, Freiburg and Strasburg and made his doctoral dissertation in 1897. Later, he worked for the United States Census Office. In 1904 he became director of the Staistical Office in Elberfeld and in 1906 took the same position in Berlin -Schoneberg. He studied rent and income in Berlin before the first World War and found that 600,000 people lived in flats which house five or more people per room. In 1926, Kuczynski chaired the Kuczynski Committee, working with the German League for Human Rights, which organized the petition for a referendum on the expropriation of the Princes. In 1928 he led the German delegation to the tenth anniversary of the Russian Revolution. In 1933, after Hitler had come to power, Kuczynski left Germany and went with around 20,000 books (half of the large family library) to Great Britain. There he lectured at the London School of Economics and became later adviser for the British Colonial Office. His most noted work was in the 1930s when he published figures on the extent of the slave trade between Africa and the Americas over the preceding three centuries. His figure of 15 million slaves became widely used by other researchers, but is no longer thought to be correct. An obituary of his son Jürgen [1] refers to Rene as a banker - and the family does seem to have been massively wealthy. Eric Hobsbawm ("Interesting Times", p.145) states that while Jürgen was a "charming and ever-hopeful economic historian", his family "owned the Grunewaldviertel" in Berlin and he was "probably the richest citizen of east Berlin". Kuczynski and wife Berta Gradenwitz had six children. Among them the GDR-economist Jürgen Kuczynski, Brigitte Kuczynski, and Ursula Kuczynski. All of them were Soviet spies.   == Works by Kuczynski == Kuczynski R., Munchner Volkswirtschaftliche Studien, Vierundzwanzigstes Stuck 1897 Kuczynski R., Der Zug Nach Der Stadt: Statistische Studien Uber Vorg Nge Der Bevolkerungsbewegung Im Deutschen Reiche, 1897 Lujo Brentano and Robert Kuczynski, Die heutige Grundlage der deutschen Wehrkraft. 1900 Kuczynski R., Das Existenzminimum und verwandte Fragen.1912 Kuczynski R., Arbeitslohn und Arbeitszeit in Europa und Amerika 1870–1909, Springer, 1913 Kuczynski R., Unsere Finanzen nach dem Kriege, Springer Verlag Gmbh, Jan 1917 Kuczynski R., Der Pflichtteil des Reiches, Springer, Berlin, 1917 Kuczynski R., Schulden, Steuern und Valuta, Verlag Hans Robert Engelmann, Berlin, 1920 Kuczynski R., Wiedergutmachung und deutsche Wirtschaft, Verlag Hans Robert Engelmann, Berlin, 1921 Kuczynski R., Ein Ausweg.
