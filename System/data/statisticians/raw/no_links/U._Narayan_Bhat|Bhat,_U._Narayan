U. Narayan Bhat (born 1934) is an Indian born Mathematician, known for his contributions to queueing theory and reliability theory.   == Academic career == He received a B.A. in mathematics (1953) and B.T. in education (1954) from the University of Madras, an M.A. in statistics (1958) from Karnatak University in Dharwar and Ph.D. in Mathematical statistics from the University of Western Australia on the dissertation Some Simple and Bulk Queueing Systems: A Study of Their Transient Behavior (1965). He worked at Michigan State University (1965–66), Case Western Reserve University (1966–69), and Southern Methodist University (1969–2005). Bhat is a fellow of the American Statistical Association and elected member of the International Statistical Institute. U. Narayan Bhat was a dean of research and graduate studies at Southern Methodist University and then was named interim dean for the university's Dedman College .   == Books == A Study of the Queueing Systems M/G/1 and GI/M/1, (Springer Verlag, 1968) Elements of Applied Stochastic Processes (Wiley, 1972) Introduction to Operations Research Models (W.
